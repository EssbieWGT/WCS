(Provided by Montana State University)Three international students attending Montana State University had their F-1 visa status revoked “under the authority of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security,” MSU said in a notice Friday to the campus community.
One international student from the University of Montana also had their F-1 visa revoked, a UM spokesperson said. However, that student has graduated and is living out of state.
The F-1 visa generally allows nonimmigrant international students to enter the country as a full-time student at an accredited institution and enroll in a program that culminates in a degree, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Stephanie McCalla, chairperson of the MSU Faculty Senate, said Friday she had not yet spoken with any students who are affected, but she and other faculty are upset at the news.
“These are members of our community, and they’re being ripped away for no apparent reason,” McCalla said.
A story earlier this month from Inside Higher Ed said the Trump administration is revoking student visas every week, and it appears federal immigration officials are also terminating their student residency status, “paving the way for arrest and deportation.”
MSU in Bozeman has an estimated 400 students from 64 countries, and the vast majority of them are on F-1 visas, said spokesperson Tracy Ellig in an email.
Ellig said the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prohibits the university from providing additional information, such as where the students with revoked visas are from, their enrollment status or their ability to remain on campus.
In her message to the campus community, President Waded Cruzado said the three students from MSU whose visas were revoked have been notified and received information regarding their status and available resources.
“The university will follow all applicable laws while exercising the necessary duty of care to our students,” Cruzado said in the email.
She said MSU was sharing the information with the campus “given the heightened attention to the topic.”
“We value every student in our campus; this appreciation includes our international students who make Montana State University their university of choice,” Cruzado said.
UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said the university has 145 students on F-1 visas and 29 on J-1 visas. J-1 visas are for nonimmigrants participating in an exchange program, according to the U.S. Department of State.

UM has students from roughly 50 different countries.
Kuntz said UM learned of the changed status because it checks the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System database, where those records are stored, on a daily basis.
He said federal officials have not relayed information to UM about the change in status, and the database does not offer explanations for the change in status.
The Inside Higher Ed story said some university and immigration experts are concerned “the Trump administration is playing fast and loose” with the visa system, and it’s hindering the ability of campuses to help students “who may be targeted by ICE.”
The U.S. Department of State could not be immediately reached for comment late Friday afternoon, but a State Department spokesperson had told Inside Higher Ed it is helping keep the country safe.
“The State Department revokes visas every day in order to secure America’s borders and keep our communities safe—and will continue to do so,” the spokesperson wrote to Inside Higher Ed.
A spokesperson for the Montana University System could not be immediately reached Friday by phone for wider impacts to other public campuses.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)  North Dakota lawmakers on Friday sided with hunters in the debate over whether the state Game and Fish Department can restrict using bait when deer hunting on private property. 
The House passed Senate Bill 2137 after rejecting a proposed amendment. The bill is the same version that passed the Senate.
The North Dakota Game and Fish Department has banned landowners from setting out feed for deer for the purpose of hunting in some areas of the state. The department testified against the bill, saying that feeding bans are part of an attempt to slow the spread of chronic wasting disease in deer. 
Charlie Bahnson, wildlife veterinarian for Game and Fish, said in written testimony that chronic wasting disease is still rare in North Dakota, but the department needs the feeding restrictions as a management tool. 
But Rep. Matt Ruby, R-Minot, argued that the bans have no effect on the spread of the disease that can be fatal in deer. 
Baiting bill limiting North Dakota Game and Fish policy passes Senate

Some states have seen large declines in deer populations. Ruby said North Dakota should continue to monitor for the disease. 
North Dakota has had 122 positive tests of chronic wasting disease in deer since 2009, The Bismarck Tribune reported, citing Game and Fish Department data. Of those, 119 cases were from deer killed by hunters.
Supporters of the bill argue there has only been one confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in the state, a deer that was found dead by a landowner near Williston that tested positive for the disease.
An argument against feeding is that it encourages deer to congregate in large groups, helping disease spread. Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said the state should encourage feeding because with more feed sources, the deer groups would be smaller, he said. 
The failed amendment would have put limits on how much feed could be put out and put restrictions on where feed could be placed. It also called for a Game and Fish report on chronic wasting disease to Legislative Management.  
Hunters have turned out in large numbers at the Capitol to show support for the bill. 
The bill heads to the governor for his signature.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)After news broke of a visa being revoked from an international graduate student at the University of Iowa, UI Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS) President Cary Stough said people immediately started asking the organization and him what can be done to help.
Stough said he wasn’t surprised to hear about the incident, the latest in a series of visa cancellations hitting international students across the country. International graduate students have been preparing for something like this to happen, he said — deactivating social media, checking on their visas, making sure their university documents are up to date and connecting with immigration lawyers.
“People are very, very terrified right now,” Stough said.

COGS is compiling resources and contacts to become a hub of knowledge for international students who need help, Stough said, while urging the UI to take a harder stance against actions that hurt its students. The graduate workers union sent out a news release to students and media with information and relevant services.
UI Public Relations Manager Chris Brewer said in an email the university is “aware of students who have been impacted” by changes to their visa, but no details can be provided due to privacy reasons. He did not respond to questions about university recommendations for affected students or procedures in the situation where Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, officials come to campus looking to detain a student.
UI International Programs Dean and Associate Provost Russell Ganim alerted international students and scholars about the revoked visa Thursday morning through an email, which included contact information for the Iowa State Bar Association, UI Student Legal Services and the Iowa Law law clinic.
“International students and scholars are valued members of the Iowa community,” Ganim said in the email.
COGS added to the university’s list in its news release, naming the American Immigration Lawyers Association, IC Compassion, Iowa City Catholic Worker, Eschucha Mi Voz Iowa and the Prairielands Freedom Fund as helpful organizations in this matter.
Many immigration lawyers who have spoken with COGS are saying if a student hasn’t heard anything about changes to their visa then they shouldn’t leave the country, Stough said. According to the release, if a student sees their student visa listed as revoked in the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS), they should connect with the UI Immigration Law Clinic to check their student status and discuss next steps.
So far, communication has stayed primarily within departments relating to international students, Stough said. He was told by university officials that if ICE agents do attempt to enter classrooms or other private spaces on campus, involved parties should contact the university’s Office of the General Counsel.
International graduate students should also reach out to COGS members to plan how to keep themselves and others safe, the news release stated.
“If push comes to shove, we will protect our neighbors, our friends and our fellow coworkers here at the university to make sure that this is not only a safe space where they can continue to do research and teaching, but also a space where they’re welcome,” Stough said.
University administration should make their intention to protect international students public, Stough said, and gave the option of paying impacted students’ legal fees as a good first step in offering support.
If the UI continues to lose graduate students due to state and federal actions, either being forced to go or choosing to leave, Stough said eventually it won’t have enough workers to teach courses. This would lead to lower undergraduate enrollment and the loss of revenue.
“The university should be standing up for its international students,” Stough said. “Diversity here makes us great. It also connects us with a larger community throughout the world, and any infringement upon that should be against the university’s mission.”

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Two bills regulating student-athlete compensation at colleges across the state are headed to the governor’s desk after passage through the Montana Legislature on Friday.
Senate Bill 482 requires written contracts for student-athlete usage of their name, image and likeness, while Senate Bill 271 removes an existing prohibition on schools directly paying student-athletes.
Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula introduced both bills, which she said will allow Montana’s largest schools to be competitive in the Big Sky Conference. She also brought the state’s original NIL legislation in 2021.
“If folks do care about the nuance, it actually puts more side rails on NIL for student athletes,” Boldman said in a committee hearing on both bills on April 7. “The university themselves will have a little bit more control over making sure that student athletes understand their contractual agreements and make sure that they’re not taken advantage of in the private sector.”
On SB 482, Boldman said, “We just want to make sure if you’re going to offer our student athletes a deal, it’s got to be in writing.”
The new law rolls back previous laws that specifically prohibited Montana universities and colleges from paying their student-athletes. As an example, some colleges have begun to place student-athletes names on the back of jerseys sold to fans — the players then get a cut of that revenue.

Institutions are already allowed to act as agents or add name, image and likeness agreements to scholarship agreements.
The legislation does not change outside endorsement deals, though does formalize those agreements in writing, meaning a verbal agreement does not constitute a legally binding contract.
“This is about fairness, opportunity, and keeping Montana competitive,” Boldman said in a press release.
Montana has three schools that compete in the NCAA: The University of Montana, Montana State University and Montana State University-Billings.
Similar discussions have occurred at the federal level, and a federal court is expected to soon rule on a $2.8 billion antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA which, if found against the athletics organizations, could allow student-athletes to have revenue sharing agreements and provide backpay.
Boldman said her bills will allow Montana student athletes to take part in the settlement.
“We want our student athletes to be able to opt into that settlement, which will then entitle them to some additional compensation,” Boldman said.
Representatives from Montana and Montana State both testified in support of the bill during its hearing.
“We have the compliance and support staff here to navigate this constantly changing landscape, and this change gives us the certainty we need to act within the bounds of state law,” UM spokesperson Dave Kuntz said during the hearing for SB 271. “With other legislative bodies around the region making similar changes, this bill will help ensure campus policies remain in line with our regional competitors as well.”
 Impacts to the NAIA

Beyond the NCAA schools in the state, the six Montana schools whose athletic teams belong to the Frontier Conference in the NAIA could also be impacted.

In 2020, the NAIA passed name, image and likeness rules for its member schools. It allowed athletes to be paid, but, Montana Tech men’s basketball head coach Adam Hiatt said, “the NAIA legislation did not intend to allow schools to pay student-athletes directly for NIL purposes.”
He added some Tech student-athletes have been able to take advantage of agreements for their name, image and likeness. He said there’s no plan to pay players through the school until the NAIA changes its policies.
Montana Tech athletic director Matt Stepan said the university is reviewing the legislation to see how it will impact them.
“While the new legislation may not have an immediate or direct effect on our recruiting efforts, changes of this nature often create ripple effects throughout college athletics,” Stepan said. “We’ll be monitoring the situation closely to determine any indirect implications for NAIA institutions and student-athletes.”

(Courtesy photos) Dispensing with a need for additional briefs or oral arguments, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled Friday in the high-profile dispute over last November’s closely contested election for an associate justice seat on the high court.
If implemented without further action by the federal courts, it appears the ruling could overturn the election result that has been confirmed by two recounts in which incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs defeated her Republican challenger, state Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, by 734 votes.
The unsigned opinion was agreed to by four justices — all Republicans — Chief Justice Paul Newby and Associate Justices Trey Allen, Tamara Barringer, and Phil Berger, Jr. Two associate justices — Republican Richard Dietz and Democrat Anita Earls — concurred in part and dissented in part.
The ruling partially upholds and partially reverses a 2-1 Court of Appeals ruling issued last Friday on three key issues:

It reverses the Court of Appeals on the matter of throwing out 60,000-plus ballots cast by voters whose voter registration forms did not include a driver’s license number or last four digits of a social security number. While the Supreme Court opinion castigated the Board of Elections for what it called “inattention and failure to dutifully conform its conduct to the law’s requirements” by failing to fix flawed records, it said that throwing out those votes of voters for mistakes that were not their own (and, it emphasized, who had displayed photo ID while voting) would violate established precedent.
It upheld the Court of Appeals ruling on the question of certain military and overseas-citizen voters who used absentee ballots, but did not provide a copy of their photo ID with their ballot — something the Board of Elections has never required. Under the ruling, those voters will have to come forward to show their photo ID within 30 days “after the mailing of notice.”
It upheld the Court of Appeals on the question of so-called “never residents” — a few hundred absentee voters who have never lived in North Carolina, but who are connected to the state through their parents. The ruling says these voters should not have been allowed to vote.

In their opinions, both Justices Dietz and Earls concurred with the ruling on the 60,000-plus voters but issued blistering dissents on the other two categories, saying the court’s acceptance of the idea of changing voting rules after the election is violative of long-established precedent.
In blasting the court’s ruling on military voters — which only applies to a small number of predominately Democratic-leaning counties — and voters connected the through their parents who have long voted in the state, Justice Earls wrote:

        “It is no small thing to overturn the results of an election in a democracy by throwing out ballots that were legally cast consistent with all election laws in effect on the day of the election. Some would call it stealing the election, others might call it a bloodless coup, but by whatever name, no amount of smoke and mirrors makes it legitimate.”    
 
Justice Dietz wrote the court should hear arguments in the case and rule that Griffin’s claims “are not justiciable in a backward looking challenge to a past election.”
In a statement issued shortly after the ruling was handed down, Justice Riggs issued the following statement and said her attorneys would be seeking immediate action in federal court:


“I’m the proud daughter of a 30-year military veteran who was deployed overseas, and it is unacceptable that the Court is choosing to selectively disenfranchise North Carolinians serving our country, here and overseas. While I’m gratified to see the Court of Appeals reversed on the erroneous decision to potentially disenfranchise the more than 60,000 North Carolinians whose registration my opponent has recklessly challenged, I will not waiver in my fight to protect the fundamental freedoms for which our military service members and their families have sacrificed so much.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A drugmaker is suing South Dakota over a law that bars the company from limiting drug discounts used to prop up providers who serve Medicaid patients.
The lawsuit is from Chicago-based AbbVie Inc., which sells the wrinkle-remover Botox and the arthritis drug Humira, among other products. The litigation challenges the legality of a bill signed into law by South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden on March 11. 
Senate Bill 154 bars drug companies from limiting the number of pharmacies that hospitals and clinics can contract with to distribute drugs through the federal 340B program.
As demand for weight-loss drugs rises, states grapple with Medicaid coverage

The bill’s supporters called 340B a lifeline for rural health care providers and pharmacies. Those providers are kneecapped by Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements too low to keep the lights on, they said, and they need the supplemental income.
The bill’s opponents, however, argued that the way providers use 340B to recoup their expenses — by getting drugs on the cheap and marking them up — is unsustainable, harmful to patients and interferes in the free market.
The Legislature sided with providers. 
In its lawsuit, AbbVie Inc. alleges that South Dakota’s new law amounts to an illegal “taking” of the company’s products by forcing it to provide them at a discount through contract pharmacies without any say in which or how many pharmacies are involved. 
The company also argues that SB 154 alters the terms of a federal law South Dakota legislators did not write and cannot legally modify, and that it seeks to regulate interstate commerce in a way only Congress has the power to do.
The bill “places an improper thumb on the scale and tilts the bargaining power in favor of in-state pharmacies and covered entities at the expense of out-of-state manufacturers,” the lawsuit says.
Other states have passed similar laws and faced similar lawsuits.
AbbVie filed its lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court in South Dakota. Six days ago, a federal judge in Minnesota dismissed a similar case challenging the legality of a similar law in that state.
The Eighth Circuit of Appeals ruled in favor of Arkansas for its version of the law.
The pharmaceutical industry has also won some victories, though. Last summer, in a case filed by United Therapeutics Corporation in Washington, D.C., a three-judge panel upheld a lower court’s ruling that the law behind the 340B program doesn’t bar drugmakers from imposing limitations on how it distributes drugs through the program.
Attorney General Marty Jackley is a named defendant in the South Dakota case, as is Larry Deiter, director of the state Division of Insurance.
Jackley’s office defends state law in court, regardless of Jackley’s status as a named defendant in a case. His spokesman, Tony Mangan, told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday that the state had not yet been served with a copy of the lawsuit.
History, changes to program
The 340B program requires drugmakers who want to participate in Medicaid and Medicare to discount their prices for hospitals, clinics and other providers that serve low-income patients. Those “covered entities” can then sell those drugs at a higher price and use the difference to help fill budget gaps and keep the doors open for patients. 
World-famous Wall Drug isn’t immune from challenges facing rural pharmacies

When it became law in 1992, 340B was limited to a small subset of hospitals and clinics, like those serving mostly Medicaid patients. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expanded 340B to a wider range of providers, roping in places that act as “sole community hospitals” for Medicaid patients who reside in rural geographies. Since then, according to a report from the American Hospital Association, the number of rural providers using it has more than doubled.
What’s also happened, according to the lawsuit from AbbVie, is an expansion of access to lower prices by contract pharmacies.
Commercial pharmacies don’t qualify as “covered entities” under 340B, meaning they don’t have access to discounted drugs unless they contract with a health care provider who does.
The lawsuit paints the agreements between Medicaid-serving providers and their contracted pharmacies as a way to make money on the backs of drugmakers and low-income patients.
“Instead of serving the covered entities’ uninsured and low-income patients, the for-profit contract pharmacies acquire manufacturers’ drugs at the federally discounted price, sell them to patients (including indigent patients) at full price, and pocket the difference,” the lawsuit says.
South Dakota providers: Program keeps us afloat
Lobbyists for South Dakota’s health care systems, rural hospitals and pharmacists offered a different perspective on the arrangements.
Mobridge Regional Hospital Director John Ayoub told lawmakers in February that his nonprofit system serves clients across North and South Dakota. 
“We are the only hospital providing obstetrical services and delivering babies, as well as the only hospital providing general and trauma surgery services in at least a 100 mile radius in every direction,” Ayoub said.

  Rep. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, listens to testimony during the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on March 4, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)
 

Many of its patients qualify for Medicaid, Ayoub said, and low reimbursement rates mean the Mobridge system often operates in the red. It lost $600,000 last year, he said, and $1 million the year before. 
Without the financial prop-up of 340B — funded by drugmakers, not taxpayers — some services might have to end and “people will die.”
“This is not hyperbole,” he said. “It’s just a fact.”
Dillon Kjerstad operates independent pharmacies in Philp and Custer. He said the ability to collect a “reasonable fee” through 340B helps him keep the doors open. If drug companies were able to limit contract pharmacies, it might make it impossible for him to continue offering drugs to Medicaid patients.
“Driving 90 miles to Rapid City in the dead of winter just isn’t an option for my pharmacy’s senior diabetic patient who needs medications now,” Kjerstad said Feb. 19.
Drug company lobbyists and the lobbyist for a free-market political organization told lawmakers that the bill seeks to solve a problem that ought to be solved by Congress.
Sen. Sydney Davis, R-Burbank, voted in favor of SB 154. Before casting her vote, though, she offered a nod to the notion that 340B fills a gap created by low federal reimbursement rates.
“Hospitals and clinics and pharmacies are playing the cards that they’ve been dealt,” Davis said. “And Congress needs to take action.”

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)An Iowa-licensed social worker accused of having personal or sexual relationships with two clients is now facing disciplinary action from the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals.
State records indicate Stephanie A. Levy is charged with engaging in sexual activity with a former client within five years of the client relationship ending, and with having her social work license revoked in the state of Nebraska.
The board has not disclosed the underlying allegations that form the basis of the two charges, but says Levy is currently an Iowa-licensed social worker who practiced in Omaha during the period when the alleged violations took place.
A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 12, 2025.
Nebraska Bureau of Public Health records show the bureau revoked Levy’s license as a master social worker and mental health practitioner in March 2024 for alleged immoral or dishonorable conduct, exploitation and failure to keep adequate records.
The Nebraska records indicate Levy was working in private practice as a mental health practitioner and was a leader in the Nebraska First Responders’ Support Network when the alleged violations occurred. In those roles, the bureau alleged, Levy had consistent contact with multiple current and former clients outside of any therapeutic relationship.
The bureau alleges that while speaking to a therapist, Levy disclosed that in the fall of 2020, she had become attracted to a female first responder to whom she provided services between July 2019 and February 2022.
In February 2021, the bureau alleged, the first responder admitted to her ex-wife she was having an affair with Levy, and in September 2021, Levy and the first responder attended a wedding together as a couple. In January 2022, Levy allegedly moved out of the home she shared with her husband and, on occasion, began staying at the first-responder’s home.
According to the bureau, Levy admitted to a state investigator, “I recognize that this is against the rules, I own it and, yeah, that is where we are at.”
As part of the board’s investigation of the matter, an investigator spoke to another of Levy’s clients who allegedly said he and Levy had once maintained a “weird, blended relationship” and that, “yes, professional lines were probably crossed.”
That former client also alleged Levy had asked him to lie to conceal her relationship with the first responder and had once asked him if he wanted to “know what the sex with (the first responder) was like.”



Bettendorf social worker charged
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently charged Jamie L. Roggenbauer with practicing in a professional relationship while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol, and with unprofessional conduct by interfering with a previous employer’s information technology systems.
According to the board, the undisclosed conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred at some unspecified time in the past when Roggenbauer practiced in Bettendorf where she now resides.

Rep. Brian Close, D-Bozeman, a lawyer, said the bill had no proponents speak during the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. The only Republican attorney on the committee opposed the bill, he added. 
“There were not a bunch of lawyers lined up in the hallway crying, ‘Free us from our shackles,’” Close said. “So the persons most affected by the current bar structure are fine with it.”
The Montana State Supreme Court ordered the creation of the State Bar in 1974, making membership to the Bar a condition to practice law in Montana.
Sen. John Fuller, R-Kalispell, introduced SB 92 as a “freedom bill.” His main issue, he said, was that the state Bar collects dues from members, and takes stances on some political issues, including lobbying the Legislature. 
If a member has an issue with a State Bar position, they can get their proportion of funds used in the effort refunded, which last session amounted to $7.61.
Despite this, Fuller said he still took issue with the requirement to associate with members of the state Bar.
Alanah Griffith, D-Gallatin Gateway, an attorney and former treasurer for the state Bar, said during the floor debate she was concerned the bill didn’t contain a clear substitute mechanism for how attorneys who opt out of the State Bar would complete their licensing and continuing-education requirements for maintaining their status.
Other opponents to the bill in the House pointed out that the Montana Constitution clearly states the state Supreme Court may make rules governing admission to the Bar, and legislative action would be overreach. 
Millett, who is not an attorney, pushed back on that notion by indicating there was no legal review note from legislative staff attached to the bill. 
Fuller had previously objected to the state Bar for disparaging remarks and name-calling by a Montana lawyer during a panel hosted by the organization as part of a continuing legal education seminar last year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3720-scaled-e1744406607973-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-04-11 18:04:39.131919

John Gray/Verite News)The federal government has sufficient grounds to deport Mahmoud Khalil – the former Columbia University student-activist and green-card holder currently detained in Louisiana — an immigration judge found after a tense hearing Friday at the LaSalle immigration court in Jena.
Khalil’s supporters argue the Trump administration’s actions against him — since he was picked up by federal immigration agents in New York and shipped to LaSalle Parish last month — are a violation of his First Amendment rights.
As The Guardian reported, legal filings from lawyers representing the government do not accuse Khalil of any criminal conduct. Rather, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has deemed Khalil a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests simply because of his support for pro-Palestinian protests, which Rubio labeled “antisemitic,” on Columbia’s campus last year. And under a rarely used provision of federal immigration law, that finding alone made him eligible for removal, Judge Jamee Comans found.
In her decision, Comans said she determined the U.S. Department of Homeland Security “had met its burden” to remove Khalil from the United States. “This court is obligated to apply the laws as written by Congress,” Comans said, adding that immigration judges are without authority to overrule a determination made by the Secretary of State or consider whether that determination was a violation of Khalil’s First Amendment rights.

Over the last several weeks, the Trump administration has targeted several other international students and academics who have participated in pro-Palestinian activities at American universities. Whether or not they’ll be able to secure those deportations is now a matter for the courts to decide.  Attorneys for Khalil are also seeking his release from detention in a separate legal battle playing out in a federal court in New Jersey.
Friday’s ruling means that Khalil will remain in detention at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a privately operated detention center in Jena that is connected to the court, while his attorneys continue to fight his removal through an appeals process.
At the end of the hearing, Khalil stood up and made a statement.
“There is nothing that is more important to this court than due process and fundamental fairness,” he said, paraphrasing remarks Comans had made from the bench.
“Neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” Khalil said. “This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”
“I just hope that the urgency you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.”
Members of Khalil’s legal team planned a Friday afternoon press conference to respond to the ruling.
Representatives for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.
After the hearing, immigrants’ rights advocates and clergy who gathered at a news conference presented a statement from Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child and could not travel to Louisiana.
“Today’s decision feels like a devastating blow to our family,” Abdalla said. “My husband is a political prisoner who is being deprived of his rights because he believes Palestinians deserve equal dignity and freedom. There is nothing the government can say about my husband that can silence this truth.”
“In less than a month, Mahmoud and I will welcome our first child. Until we are reunited, I will not stop advocating for my husband’s safe return home.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With the deadline fast approaching to gather enough signatures to qualify for a ballot referendum, the coalition of Utah labor groups trying to overturn a controversial union bill is feeling optimistic. 
Since March 15, the Protect Utah Workers coalition, which consists of teacher, firefighter, police and other unions, both in the public and private sector, has been gathering signatures around the state in hopes to qualify for a referendum that could ultimately overturn HB267.
The final day to sign in support of the referendum is Tuesday, April 15 — by Wednesday, the coalition plans on delivering the signature packets to county clerks.
“We’re feeling really optimistic. We’re going to get this, and we’ll be ready to go next Wednesday, when everything gets turned in,” said Brad Asay, Utah president of the American Federation of Teachers. “We’re right on track.”

Passed by lawmakers earlier this winter and signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox on Valentine’s Day, HB267 prevents public unions from collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate terms of employment. 
That means a teachers union, for example, can no longer negotiate an employment contract with a school district. The same goes for firefighters, police officers, municipal workers and other public employees. The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
The bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, say HB267 is meant to protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. 
But labor groups and members of the public were staunchly opposed to the bill, which narrowly passed out of the Legislature. That opposition morphed into an effort to gather enough signatures to trigger a referendum, a process where citizens can vote on new laws, or repeal existing ones, during elections. 
The coalition has roughly 5,000 union members and volunteers that for the last month have been around the state gathering signatures. 
“We have had a lot of momentum going into this,” said Renée Pinkney, president of the Utah Education Association, a teachers union that represents about 18,000 educators. “The scale, we anticipate, is going to be growing day by day as we get closer to the turn-in date, and we’re cautiously optimistic that this is going to be a huge success.” 
Sen. Mike Lee proposes a public union bill similar to the law passed by Utah this year

The process to qualify for a citizen-led ballot referendum is difficult. Of the 26 states that allow them, Utah has some of the steepest requirements for a referendum, requiring signatures from at least 8% of the state’s voters in 30 days. In addition, the law requires signatures from 8% of voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts. 
The signature packets are then handed over to the county clerks — once clerks have verified the voter registration of the signees, the lieutenant governor’s office will review the process. Assuming the coalition has complied with state code and gathered enough valid signatures, ballot language will be crafted for the 2026 General Election. 
“We believe it’s difficult by design, because legislators don’t want the referendum process to be easy,” said Pinkney, pointing to requirements like specific margins for the signature packets, or the number of staples used in each packet. 
Currently, 8% of the state’s voters equates to roughly 141,000 signatures. In late March, the coalition held a news conference at the Utah Capitol announcing they had 130,000 signatures. 
But it’s unlikely all of those signatures are valid — some people may have signed twice, or aren’t registered to vote. Others may have given an incorrect address, or have illegible handwriting. So the coalition is trying to go above and beyond that 141,000 threshold. 
“The more signatures you get, the better cushion there is,” said Asay. 
The coalition has been trying to gather signatures around the state. Volunteers have been at coffee shops, grocery stores, college campuses, congressional town halls, bus stops, tattoo parlors, TRAX stations, sporting events and protests.
“The numbers change literally hour by hour, because we have so many people returning packets,” said Pinkney, who likely won’t know exactly how many signatures the coalition has gathered until the lieutenant governor’s office informs the coalition.  



Let us know what you think...


 


During the legislative session, the opposition to the bill was diverse, with firefighters, police officers, teachers, steelworkers, electricians, flight attendants, municipal workers, plumbers, delivery drivers and more, all speaking out against HB267. 
Now, as advocates gather signatures around the state, they’re seeing a similar turnout.  
“It’s been across the board. We’ve had people from across the aisle, we’ve had conservatives, we’ve had progressives, we’ve had people that just do not like what the Legislature did,” said Asay. “What we’re seeing is a lot of people that are upset at the Legislature because they feel like they don’t have a voice. That’s been the theme.” 
Though controversial among labor groups, HB267 was supported by a number of conservative advocacy and policy groups — that includes Americans for Prosperity, which kicked off its “Decline to Sign” campaign last month. 
The group says the labor coalition has been spreading misinformation related to HB267 and is urging Utahns not to throw their signatures behind the effort. The campaign includes radio and digital advertisements with a simple message: “Don’t sign the referendum — stand for accountability!”  
“The messaging that they need these collective bargaining rights when so many are already not using it, is just fundamentally wrong,” said Americans for Prosperity-Utah state director Kevin Greene in an interview last month, pointing to other school districts, fire and police departments, and municipalities that don’t collectively bargain and haven’t seen stagnant wages or unsafe work environments.

Democrat Josh Shapiro in a lawsuit over a recent U.S. Department of Education cancellation of funds for three programs funded through the American Rescue Act to help vulnerable school children recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Homeless Children and Youth; Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund; and Emergency Assistance to Nonpublic Schools programs.
“Cutting critical funding that students and schools are counting on is unacceptable and reckless,” Torrez said in a statement. “These cuts will have a detrimental effect on our children, stunting their ability to learn in the classroom by rendering schools unable to provide essential resources like food, classroom supplies, special education for teachers and more.”
The lawsuit notes that the U.S. Department of Education in late 2023 and early 2024, “long after the federal government had declared that the COVID-19 pandemic was over,” had given the plaintiff states extensions to use the money they had been awarded to combat the pandemic’s impact on vulnerable student populations.
On March 28, “with no advance notice or warning,” U.S Education Secretary Linda McMahon rescinded that extension, effective the end of the day.
“ED’s drastic and abrupt change in position triggered chaos for state education departments…and local school districts,” the complaint says. “If the rescission action is not vacated and the approved extensions are not reinstated, key programs and services that address ongoing  and emerging education needs of Plaintiffs’ students and local school districts to combat the long term effects of the pandemic will have to be dissolved or disbanded.”
The suit asks for the court to find that the federal education department’s rescission of funds violates the American Rescue Act, and to restate the original extension date of  March 28, 2026.
New Mexico, as of the date the federal education department cancelled the extension of the funds, still had about $778,000 unliquidated funds of the $6.4 million it received under HYC; $12.3 million of the $979.7 million it received under ESSER; and approximately $4.79 million of the $17.4 million it received under EANS.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 18:04:39.131919

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota University System Chancellor Mark Hagerott will retire at the end of April, according to a Friday announcement.

Hagerott originally planned to step down as chancellor at the end of 2025, then serve a three-year contract as a professor of artificial intelligence and human security for the University System. He told the State Board of Higher Education at a Friday meeting his plans to move his retirement date up.
He will no longer be taking the teaching position, a University System spokesperson confirmed Friday.

In a Friday open letter, the Navy veteran and cybersecurity expert said he was accelerating his retirement to devote himself to national security work.
“In these times of rapid military change, my research and book project with the Naval Institute Press on naval officer formation has been expanded significantly with the emergence of artificial intelligence,” he wrote.
The State Board of Higher Education will meet early next week to figure out next steps for selecting an interim chancellor, according to the announcement.
Hagerott will remain on the Secretary of the Navy’s Education for Seapower Advisory Board, the announcement states.
Hagerott will split his time between Washington, D.C., and North Dakota, and hopes to spend more time at his family farm in Morton County, the release said.
The chancellor took a leave of absence last year to prepare to teach a class on AI and to work on a book.
He has led North Dakota’s 11 public colleges and universities since 2015.

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed two bills this week concerning New Mexico children, but called out lawmakers for missed opportunities. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Bills requiring the regulation of cell phones in schools and that hospitals have a safe care plan for substance-exposed newborns were signed into law this week, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham used the bills to point out lawmakers’ missed opportunities.
Lujan Grisham signed 22 bills into law on Thursday, including Senate Bill 11, which requires local school districts and charter schools to adopt a wireless communication device policy; and Senate Bill 42, which requires hospitals have a plan of safe care in place when newborns are found to be exposed to controlled substances and requires their parents to participate in the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act program. 
In a memo explaining her decision to sign SB11, the governor said that while it was a “first step” toward regulating cell phone use in schools, she was “profoundly disappointed” that lawmakers chose to amend the bill to make compliance optional for local districts. The amendment loosens the wording around the Public Education Department’s minimum requirements for local policies.
“Once again, however, the Legislature squirmed out of taking a meaningful step to improve education under the auspices of local control,” the governor wrote. “That is all well and good until this same body blames the Public Education Department-and not the local bodies-for poor educational outcomes of New Mexico students. I once again encourage the Legislature to hold local school districts accountable for educational outcomes. Our students deserve it.”
Lujan Grisham had a similar response in her veto message about House Bill 65, which would have clarified that local school districts have the authority to determine the number of instructional days in their school calendar. Instead, she voiced her support of a 2024 PED rule – which has not been enforced – requiring local districts to have a minimum of 180 days in their calendars.
PED’s 180-day school calendar rule back in the courts

In another memo this week, Lujan Grisham explained that she chose to sign SB42 because of its requirement that parents of substance-exposed newborns receive treatment through the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act program. However, she called out lawmakers for continuing an “unwarranted vendetta” against the Children, Youth and Families Department, particularly for including amendments to the bill, which require department employees to backup electronic device data daily, monthly and annually. 
“If the Legislature actually wanted to help children and CYFD, it would have fully funded the agency so that it could hire all the staff it needs to succeed,” Lujan Grisham wrote. “The Legislature seems to be of the opinion that adding ever increasing administrative burdens on an agency that they refuse to fund at required levels will make children safer. They also seem to believe that piling on criticisms for problems that they bare some responsibility for creating will absolve them of their own neglect. They are wrong.”
She went on to encourage lawmakers to consider becoming foster parents or apply for a job or volunteer position with CYFD. 
“It is far too easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize CYFD. I hope the Legislature will commit not only to fully funding CYFD, but also to do their part on an individual level to help make a difference in children’s lives,” Lujan Grisham wrote.
The governor voiced similar criticism of lawmakers, as well as Attorney General Raúl Torrez, before the end of the session when she signed House Bill 5 into law, establishing the Office of the Child Advocate. She pointed out lawmakers seem to continuously “condemn” CYFD and its employees, and “refuse to fully fund the agency to hire enough staff then criticize [the department’s] vacancy rates and unmanageable workloads.”

(Photo by Liam DeBonis for Source NM)Most of the public spending that New Mexico lawmakers voted to send up to the state’s governor this year managed to avoid the wrath of her veto pen.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Friday signed three pieces of legislation into law, establishing the state government’s income and spending over the next year, along with authorizing one-time spending on public infrastructure projects.
“These appropriations bills represent significant investments in New Mexico’s future, from education and healthcare to critical infrastructure,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement.
The governor has the authority to sign legislation while rejecting specific parts that propose to spend public funds, called “line-item vetoes.”
In a news release, the governor’s office said her line-item vetoes “reflect her concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability, implementation timelines, or alignment with the administration’s strategic priorities.”
“The targeted line-item vetoes were necessary to maintain fiscal responsibility while ensuring that we fund our highest-priority projects and initiatives,” Lujan Grisham said.
Yearly state budget
Lujan Grisham signed House Bills 2 and 3, which set the $10.8 billion state budget for Fiscal Year 2026, representing a 6% increase from last year.
She made a series of 87 line-item vetoes to the budget that fall into four categories: parts that “impermissibly attempt to create substantive law;” parts that “attempt to enact general policy;” parts that “intrude into the executive managerial function;” and parts that “unduly restrict appropriations to specified types of expenditures.”
Of those, 14 line-item vetoes total approximately $331 million that will not be spent, approximately 0.03% of the total. They include:

$80 million for housing programs in Bernalillo County and $10 million for programs in Doña Ana County, leaving intact $110 million for housing projects in general
$6 million for bioscience development, contingent on a legislative proposal that did not pass
$5 million to help doctors working in behavioral health settings to repay loans, leaving intact $20 million for all health professionals
$5 million to help doctors repay loans, contingent on a legislative proposal that did not pass
$4.6 million that would have gone through the Public Education Department to tribal education departments
$4 million for a Sundance satellite festival and academy
$2.7 million that would have paid for student testing
$2.5 million for flood control improvements near Hatch
$1 million for a public safety campus in Chaparral and $2 million for public safety infrastructure in Luna, Hidalgo and Doña Ana counties, leaving intact $10 million for public safety infrastructure in general
$2 million for rural airports
$1.65 million that would have covered start-up costs for the Department of Justice to establish an Office of the Child Advocate, contingent on a legislative proposal that she signed
$1 million that would have paid for the Legislative Finance Committee to evaluate the new behavioral health package, and $1 million for LFC to create a children’s future task force, contingent on a legislative proposal that did not pass
$1 million for career pathways programs at the Higher Education Department

Lujan Grisham also allowed $5 million to go to the Department of Finance and Administration for grants to local governments to close encampments of homeless people, but vetoed language that would have also made the money available to use for streamlined housing placements, campsite services from outreach workers, housing navigators and case managers.
In her message to lawmakers, the governor noted that she also signed other bills that created a behavioral health trust fund, created a Medicaid trust fund, increasing the annual money going to the Early Childhood Education and Care Department to a minimum of $500 million, establishing the Strategic Water Supply, modernizing the Water Quality Act and regulating harmful PFAS chemicals.

New infrastructure
Lujan Grisham signed House Bill 450, which authorizes $1.2 billion in new one-time capital outlay project spending on colleges and universities, public schools, health facilities, state parks, a new STEM center, water projects, courts, senior centers, electric vehicle infrastructure, prisons and acequias.
HB450 also sets aside $595 million for local government projects like schools; water and sewer; police; public buildings; health, housing; parks; roads; cultural facilities; transportation; prisons; and military and emergency response projects.
Lujan Grisham wrote that she made a series of line-item vetoes to new capital outlay project money totaling $1.2 million, or approximately 0.10% of the total, that would have gone to projects that “lack proper planning or are not ready to proceed.”
She wrote that she also vetoed all capital outlay appropriations under $10,000, because “state and local governments have other means well within their capacities to fund these smaller projects.”
She also vetoed parts of HB450 that are “unnecessarily restrictive” on decisions made by executive branch state agencies, to ensure money goes to the proper place and to guarantee the amounts are enough to complete the intended projects.
Old infrastructure
The governor also signed Senate Bill 425, which reauthorizes old capital outlay project spending that the state approved in prior years but has not yet been spent.
“We must deploy these resources to benefit New Mexico’s children, families and communities, and this legislation advances that goal,” she wrote.
The governor made 112 line-item vetoes to old capital outlay money in SB425, representing approximately 26% of the 423 total projects in SB425.
Lujan Grisham wrote that each line-item veto was justified because either the money has not been spent; or is already found in the state budget; the bonds for the projects haven’t been issued; or the language would have created unnecessarily burdens on state agencies.
During the recent legislative session, lawmakers said they want to reform the capital outlay process to prevent wasted money on projects languishing for years without coming to fruition.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment would no longer be required to have a work permit under a bill approved by the House of Delegates Friday morning.
Delegates passed Senate Bill 427 with a 91 to 9 vote. The House’s nine Democrats voted against the bill. There was no discussion on the bill prior to Friday’s vote.
The minimum legal age to work in West Virginia is 14. Current state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent. The permit includes age certification, a commitment by the employer to employ the child legally, a description of the work the child is applying to do, a signature by the child’s principal saying that they’re attending school and parental consent. 
Under Senate Bill 427, employers seeking to hire the teenagers would be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth, as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things.
Sen. Rollan Roberts, R-Raleigh, chairman of the Senate Workforce Committee said the legislation is meant to simplify kids’ ability to work.
“We’re going into vocational training more and more in our public schools, and this provides a way that we’re not tasking the local county superintendents with having to approve the work permits instead going with the age permits,” Roberts said. “Fourteen and 15-year-olds can already work, but this will now allow the parents to make that decision.”
Opponents of the legislation say that eliminating work permits may lead to children being exploited.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said in a statement that work permits are vital protection for children and families to help ensure compliance with child labor laws. Research shows that child labor violations are lower in states that require them, she said. 
“While Senate and House committees certainly improved the legislation via amendments from the extremely dangerous introduced version, the final product is unnecessary at best and harmful at worst,” Allen said. “We will closely follow the implementation and impacts of this legislation to ensure youth workers are protected.”
Roberts disagreed with concerns, saying that federal child labor laws still have to be followed.  
“So no, they won’t be working in coal mines and with heavy machinery and all these kinds of things,” Roberts said. “Basically, what I envision is that we’re helping the kids at entry level to get into the workforce.”
He added that the 18 to 24 age group is the lowest performing age group for workforce participation. 
The bill will next go back to the Senate to approve any changes in the bill the House made. After that, it will go to Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk for approval.

The bill was later taken off notice in the Senate. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A bill that would criminalize knowingly giving firearms to someone who recently received inpatient mental health treatment was pushed to 2026 on Wednesday  amid questions about its language.
Rep. Shaundelle Brooks, a Hermitage Democrat, named the bill “Akilah’s Law” in honor of her son Akilah Dasilva, who was killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville Waffle House in 2018.
The shooter, Travis Reinking of Morton, Illinois, had a history of schizophrenia and delusions. Prior to the shooting, Illinois State Police had revoked his firearm owner identification card, forcing him to surrender his guns to his father. His father then returned the guns to Reinking, breaking Illinois state law. 
Tennessee bars giving firearms to juveniles or intoxicated people, but not those who have been committed for mental health evaluation.
Brooks said her bill intends to bring Tennessee in line with the Illinois law that prohibits someone from giving or selling a firearm to a person who has been a patient in a mental health institution within five years.
Giving guns to certain mental health patients could become a crime in Tennessee

Brooks’ bill passed the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee in late March, but questions over the bill’s scope and language arose in the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 8. 
Sen. Paul Rose, a Southwest Tennessee Republican, asked for clarity on what the bill defines as a “mental health institution” and what it means to be “admitted.” Rose questioned whether a person who makes routine visits to a mental health provider for medication would be considered a patient of a mental health institution under the bill’s definition.
The bill’s Senate sponsor, Memphis Democrat Raumesh Akbari, said she did not believe the bill would apply in that case. 
Elliot Pinsly, president and CEO of the Behavioral Health Foundation, said the way the legislation is written could have a “chilling effect on people’s willingness to seek mental health treatment in Tennessee.” Pinsly, a licensed clinical social worker, founded the policy-focused nonprofit in 2020.
“The actual bill makes it a crime punishable by up to one year imprisonment to sell, give or otherwise transfer a firearm to a person who has received just about any kind of mental health care or addiction treatment in the past five years, voluntary or involuntary, outpatient or inpatient,” Pinsly said.
Facing uncertainty on the outcome of a committee vote, Akbari chose to move the bill to the general subcommittee, essentially putting it on ice until it can be resurrected in 2026.
“I look forward to Representative Brooks continuing to move this through the House … I will be working with all members on this committee so that we can reach a solution so we can really protect folks in Tennessee,” Akbari said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The first quarter of the year came and went without a peep from Hasbro Inc. on whether the Pawtucket toy and gaming company would be moving out of its Pawtucket headquarters — and where it would go.
Now, the decision has been postponed, with “clarity” on a potential relocation expected by this summer, Andrea Snyder, a Hasbro spokesperson, confirmed in an email Friday morning.
Snyder did not respond to questions about how the economic aftershocks rippling through the stock market and major companies played into the delay. But it’s no secret that Hasbro is hurting; stocks plunged 20% since President Donald Trump announced his “reciprocal tariff” policy on April 2, with Hasbro shares hitting a 52-week low on Tuesday.
Like its game industry competitors, much of Hasbro relies on international supply chains, with 40% of its products coming from China. While Trump backed off tariffs on most other countries earlier Wednesday, the trade war with China continues to escalate, with China raising a retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports to 125% Friday morning.
Before the trade war, the company looked poised to abandon its century-old roots in the Ocean State, trading in its circa 1900 Pawtucket headquarters for a new, modern space in Boston. When news broke in September that the multinational company was eyeing a move across state lines, Rhode Island officials appeared caught off-guard.
Local and state leaders scrambled to try and persuade the company to stay, if not in Pawtucket, then in Providence, offering up a piece of prime real estate in the I-195 Redevelopment District for just $1.
But other incentives requiring state funding or legislation through the Rhode Island General Assembly have not been introduced, and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has deferred to Gov. Dan McKee to take the lead on negotiations with Hasbro executives.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said the governor’s office will “remain engaged” with Hasbro executives.
“We brought together leaders in government, business and higher education to present Hasbro with a strong proposal — one we believe will be difficult to walk away from,” DaRocha said in an email Friday.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that would reform the Prisoner Review Board passed the Illinois Senate on Thursday, aiming to protect victims and increase transparency about prisoner releases following years of controversy surrounding the board’s decisions.

Championed by Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, Senate Bill 19 would give victims the ability to file victim impact statements ahead of hearings, provide them with additional notice when their offender is granted early release, and allow them to seek an order of protection against an offender who is incarcerated.

The bill passed on a 33-22 vote, with some Democrat senators opposing the legislation.

It would also create the Office of the Director of Victim and Witness Services, which would ensure the board complies with victims’ rights, and mandates victims are provided with contact information for the State Victim Assistance Hotline

The reforms come after Crosetti Brand murdered an 11-year-old Chicago boy in 2024. That February, the board voted to release Brand, finding there was not enough evidence he had violated his conditions of release. His ex-girlfriend, Laterria Smith, was denied an emergency order of protection by a Cook County judge while Brand was imprisoned at Stateville in Crest Hill.

A day after he was released, Brand attacked Smith and murdered her 11-year-old son, Jayden Perkins, who attempted to protect his mother. The murder caused two PRB members, including the board chair, to resign.

Brand’s history of domestic violence against women prompted both advocates and lawmakers to call for stricter review of prisoners’ backgrounds before their release.

During last year’s legislative session, Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, championed a PRB reform bill that that had bipartisan support, but was never called for a vote in the House on the final day of session.

That bill would have made changes that included requiring the board to notify victims within 24 hours if an offender, whom they had an order of protection against, was released early.

In a news conference held the day after the session ended, Gov. JB Pritzker expressed his concerns with parts of the bill regarding the live stream of certain PRB meetings and the lack of funding for other requirements.

Harmon described this year’s reform bill as a “similar to, but improved upon” version of Cassidy’s bill that “expands the rights of victims to be heard and to be notified.”

The bill would change qualifications for board members, requiring seven out of the 15 board members to have at least five years of experience as a law enforcement officer, parole officer, prosecutor, criminal defense attorney or judge.

It would also change the term limits of any new board members elected from six to eight years, something Harmon said would allow board members to be less concerned about their reappointment and more focused on making “good decisions.”

Sen. Steve McClure, R-Springfield, voiced his disagreement on the Senate floor Thursday. He asked Harmon how he thought it was a “great idea” to lengthen terms for members, who he said are vetted by the governor.

“The Senate can't pass a law by itself. The bill before us, I believe, will be well-received and passed by the House and signed by the governor,” Harmon said in response. “It is the best bill we are able to pass into law at the present time.”

Republicans have spent years criticizing Pritzker’s appointments to the board following several controversial nominations in recent years.

The bill now awaits action in the House.

Greg Gianforte gives his inauguration address at the Montana State Capitol on Jan. 6, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan). Most Montanans have a positive view of Gov. Greg Gianforte in the early months of his second term in office, according to new poll data released Thursday.
Morning Consult surveys conducted from January through March of this year show Gianforte has a 56% approval rating among Montanans, with 34% of respondents disapproving of his job performance.
The Montana Republican Party congratulated Gianforte’s numbers, saying it indicated “strong standing with Republicans, reflecting the trust Montanans have placed in his leadership following his re-election.”

“Montanans’ strong approval of Governor Greg Gianforte reflects their continued support for his commitment to conservative Republican principles like cutting taxes, supporting small businesses, and protecting our Montana way of life,” Montana GOP Chairman Don “K” Kaltschmidt said in a statement. “The Montana GOP stands in strong support of Governor Gianforte and his pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-family agenda.”
The governor’s proposals have met some resistance in the legislature from more conservative members of his party, while Republican legislators more closely aligned with his agenda were recently censured by the state GOP.
Since being elected in 2020, Gianforte’s approval rating reached a high of 61% during 2021, and hit lows of 49%, most recently during the third quarter of 2024 leading up to his re-election.
Gianforte won his second term in November 2024 over Democrat Ryan Buysse by 22 points.
Morning Consult, a political research firm, tracks approval ratings for all 50 state governors throughout their tenure and releases quarterly results.
Gianforte has the 16th highest approval rating among all governors, and seventh highest among Republicans.
Phil Scott, the Republican governor of Vermont, has the highest approval rating from state residents, at 75%, while Kim Reynolds, a Republican from Iowa, has the highest disapproval rating from residents, at 49%.

  Gary Farmer via Florida Senate
Florida’s Judicial Qualifications Commission recommended Thursday that the high court suspend Farmer from his post pending the outcome of removal proceedings. The Supreme Court has ordered Farmer to respond to the recommendation by April 21.
Late last year, the commission began investigating inappropriate comments Farmer made earlier in the year. Further investigation found several more remarks they eventually included in their recommendation to suspend the judge. 
“Through his extensive misconduct, occurring over a lengthy period of time, Judge Farmer has damaged the public’s perception of the judiciary and the judicial branch in such a way that he has demonstrated a present unfitness to serve,” the 13-page recommendation of suspension states. 
Farmer has characterized at least some of his comments as “dad jokes” to reduce stress in the courtroom, while the JQC said his comments were demeaning and potentially humiliating. 
The panel, comprising judges, attorneys, and non-lawyers appointed by the governor, wrote that Farmer mocked a litigant in August who was expecting three children with different women. 
“Ok, you’ve been busy,” Farmer said, according to court documents. “You were just shooting all over the place! That’s good, do you know their names? First and last? Romantic are you? Don’t tell Susie about Jane don’t tell Jane about Mary God bless you man. One’s enough.” 
Later, Farmer told the defendant he was going to put him on pretrial release, “I’m going to order that you wear a condom at all times. For your own good. Ok?! Probation is going to check. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding.”
In another instance, Farmer played music from his phone for more than 80 seconds, the panel wrote, “which you referred to as the ‘song of the day.’ When nobody knew the name of the song you played, you said, ‘That means nobody gets the Golden Oreo today. I’ve got a bunch of regular Oreos you can have but the Golden Oreo has to be earned. Okay, back to business.’” 
Farmer told the investigative panel, “I don’t think we can say, as judges, that we never — there’s never a light moment or a joke in Court, so I don’t want to overstate it, but I am not doing bad jokes anymore.” 
“Respectfully, the Investigative Panel is amply justified in not trusting Judge Farmer’s judgement in this regard,” the JQC wrote.

The panel took issue with Farmer “prejudging the outcomes of future cases, not yet before him,” relating to laws permitting deadly force in self-defense. 
During his six years in the Senate, Farmer filed several pieces of gun-safety legislation.
Farmer wrote in an order that in Stand Your Ground cases with credibility issues, “the prosecutor will never be able to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant wasn’t reasonably in fear of imminent harm (i.e. proof of a negative). This doesn’t make sense to the Court, but it is the law of Florida and the Court is duty bound to apply it.”
The panel found that Farmer quoted a Marlon Wayans sketch, acknowledging as he did so that he should not have. 
“Laughing, and in a mocking voice you say, ‘Marlon Wayans — In Living Color. Two snaps and a sweater! He likes it when the Oilers play the Packers! He used to be a tight end! Now he’s a wide receiver. Oh, that’s bad. Court reporter in the sky, please! Strike that from the record!’”
The report continues:
“Finally, the Investigative Panel dismisses, out-of-hand, any suggestion that Judge Farmer’s conduct was not violative of the Code because some people laughed at his comments or did not complain about being offended. The simple fact of the matter is that Judge Farmer’s position as a judge provided him with a captive audience who would naturally and understandably be willing to laugh and reticent to complain.”
Other remarks:
“While presiding over the August 15, 2024, hearing you said, ‘Spring is here, I got so excited I wet my plants’ and ‘What did the shirt say to the pair of pants? Wassup britches!’ Apparently, these are some of what you referred to as your ‘exceptionally, exceptionally bad jokes.’”
“‘I called the incontinence hotline. They told me to hold.’ ‘Mr. [attorney present in court] is aghast.’”
“My [court] notes are like Shakira’s hips. They don’t lie.”
“During a pause in proceedings, you ask an attorney ‘Are you a fan of the Flintstone’s Mr. [attorney present]? It’s one of the most popular shows in the world. They don’t like it in Dubai though. I don’t know, but the people of Abu Dhabi do.’ After a moment of silence, the attorney replied ‘Don’t give up your day job.'”

At left is Commissioner Robert Jacquard. At right is Commissioner Layi Oduyingbo. (Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Nearly two years after its formation, Rhode Island’s three-member Cannabis Control Commission only needed 18 minutes Friday to approve an inaugural set of rules that will govern the state’s budding cannabis market.
Regulations will take effect May 1, putting the state another step closer to issuing licenses for two dozen new retail pot shops and making the Office of Cannabis Regulation become its own independent entity. 
The new rules establish new packaging and labeling requirements, outline how licenses will be awarded, and set the criteria to apply for one of the six social equity retail licenses.
Commission Chairperson Kimberly Ahern acknowledged the long road to finalize the new rules but said it was crucial to  balance industry growth with safety. All the work drafting the regulations was done in-house, rather than relying on an out-of-state contractor, she added.
“These are truly home-grown, just like our cultivators,” she said following the panel’s vote. “This is an industry that is growing here thoughtfully, intentionally, deliberately — and it needs to reflect that.”
With the regulations approved, the commission can officially take over control of Rhode Island’s cannabis industry as envisioned in the 2022 legalization law. Since recreational cannabis was legalized, the Department of Business Regulation has had oversight of the state’s fledgling recreational market.
The final approval was met with little fanfare from nearly a dozen cannabis industry representatives who attended the meeting, but many said they were excited to see the governing rules become reality.
“It’s awesome that this finally happened — we’ve been waiting years for this,” Peter Kasabian, co-founder of Sensible Cultivators for Intelligent Reform co-founder, told Rhode Island Current.
It’s certainly been a long road for Rhode Island to establish its recreational cannabis market, which was legalized by state lawmakers in 2022. Over a year passed before the three-member commission was impaneled, which then needed to hire staff to draft proposals and  conduct a review of rules adopted in other states.
In the meantime, only seven previously authorized medical marijuana dispensaries were able to sell cannabis recreationally. Under the 2022 legalization, the commission can offer 24 new licenses to recreational dispensaries, with six reserved for social equity applicants and another six reserved for worker-owned cooperatives.
Regulations call for a hybrid selection process in which applicants seeking one of the 24 new retail licenses would first be screened based on qualifications before being placed in a lottery. 
All prospective retailers would pay an application fee of $7,500 and a yearly $30,000 licensing fee. Licenses must be spread throughout six geographic zones, with a maximum of four stores per zone. 
The commission has yet to determine the date when applications will open, Ahern told reporters. 
“Certainly this calendar year, and perhaps even faster,” she said.
Specificity to come on social equity criteria
Draft rules were posted in January, where the public had 30 days to provide their feedback. More than 380 people provided comments.
“They were very helpful, very thoughtful, and I think made these regulations better,” Ahern said.
She said public feedback helped to close loopholes impacting who would qualify as a social equity applicant, which is generally meant for those who were adversely affected by the war on drugs. 
Ahern told reporters after the meeting that social equity applicants will be required to provide documentation showing they meet the criteria outlined in the 2022 Rhode Island Cannabis Act. At least 51% ownership and control must be individuals directly impacted by past cannabis laws or economic disparities. Qualifying factors include convictions for nonviolent cannabis offenses or residency in disproportionately impacted areas — which can be determined by federal poverty level, unemployment rate, the number of students in a free school lunch program, and historic arrest rates by census tract. 
A preliminary analysis presented to the commission last October found of the state’s 39 municipalities, only three met the criteria for a social equity zone set in Rhode Island’s 2022 law: Central Falls, Providence and Woonsocket. Some census tracts in Pawtucket and Newport also met the criteria.
Ahern said the commission plans to further narrow social equity criteria in future meetings.

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Maine will not be changing its policy on transgender athletes and thus is “at an impasse” with the federal government, according to a letter from the Maine Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Department of Education Friday.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights set Friday as the deadline for the Maine Department of Education to comply with a resolution agreement proposed last month that requires the state to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning trans girls from playing girls’ sports. If the state does not comply, the administration has said it will refer the case to the Department of Justice and rescind federal funding. 
“We will not sign the Resolution Agreement, and we do not have revisions to counter propose. We agree that we are at an impasse,” wrote Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster in a letter to Bradley Burke, regional director for the agency’s Office for Civil Rights. 
Further, Forster argued that Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination on which the Trump administration is basing its argument, does not legally preclude transgender inclusion in athletics. 
“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” she said.
Citing several federal court rulings — including a 2024 ruling in New Hampshire, Tirrell v. Edelblut — she added that “various federal courts have held that Title IX and/or the Equal Protection Clause require schools to allow such participation.”
Since Gov. Janet Mills and Trump got into a heated exchange over the state’s trans athlete policy, legal experts have watched the case to see how the Trump administration would respond to the state-level pushback. 
“We just need an answer at this point as to, ‘Does the Trump administration have the authority to do what it’s doing when it comes to fast tracking the removal of federal funds?’” said Jackie Wernz, a former lawyer for the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights who now represents school districts nationwide in these types of cases, in a previous interview with Maine Morning Star. 
“This is just unprecedented, and we’re not following the process that we’re used to. So I think it’s going to be really helpful for courts to start weighing in on whether or not they have the authority to do this.”
While the U.S. Department of Education has not specified how much federal funding is at stake, it awarded $347 million to Maine entities in fiscal year 2024, according to the Maine Center for Economic Policy.
Several federal agencies have launched investigations into Maine’s alleged violation of Title IX. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture froze funding to Maine school programs over alleged violations of federal law, over which the Maine Attorney General’s Office has filed suit.
In addition to the Title IX investigations, numerous other federal agencies have cut funding to programs in Maine in apparent retaliation for the state’s noncompliance. 
Earlier this week, the Department of Justice terminated several grants to the Maine Department of Corrections because of the state policy related to transgender detainees, which it approaches on a case-by-case basis. 
And the former acting director of the Social Security Administration admitted he deliberately sought to punish Maine by temporarily suspending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.

(Miami-Dade Police Dept. video)More than a dozen local governments in Florida have banned fluoride in their public water drinking systems since state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo’s recommendation in November that they do so.
Miami-Dade County won’t be one of them, though, after Mayor Daniella Levine Cava announced Friday that she would veto a resolution approved by the Board of County Commissioners on April 1 directing that fluoridation of the county’s water end within the next 30 days.

“As not only your Mayor, but also as a mother and grandmother, I care deeply about protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of our community,” Levine Cava said in a statement.
“I have listened to the dentists and medical experts and the message is clear: Water fluoridation is a safe, effective, and efficient way to maintain dental health in our county – and halting it could have long-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.”
At least 14 Florida cities have voted to remove fluoride from the water since Ladapo’s announcement, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Similar efforts are happening at the federal level.
This week, U.S. Health & Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he intends to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide.
During the same event in Utah (which recently became the first state to ban fluoride), Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin announced that his agency would review new scientific information on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.


Meanwhile, in Tallahassee, the Florida Senate will soon vote on an omnibus Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services bill (SB 700) that would prohibit public water systems from “the use of any additive included primarily for health-related purposes. Its companion in the House (HB 651) has one more stop in that chamber.
” The Florida Dental Association opposes the legislation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-11 20:13:21+00:00,CT Mirror,CT says it will stand tough if Trump comes for its climate change policies,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/11/trump-executive-order-ct-climate-laws/,"Experts say an executive order on state climate actions does not carry legal heft, and Lamont says Connecticut is 'not going to change what we do.'","During the first Trump administration’s assault on climate initiatives, it was individual states that stepped up with policies to keep the momentum going on combating climate change.
The second Trump administration is now attempting to go after state actions too.
On a day the world’s attention was diverted by a massive meltdown of financial markets reeling from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, the president signed an executive order titled Protecting American Energy from State Overreach.
The order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek out and potentially prosecute state and local actions or pending actions that “address ‘climate change’ or involving ‘environmental, social, and governance’ initiatives, ‘environmental justice,’ carbon or ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.” It calls such actions “burdensome and ideologically motivated.”
Whether the goal is truly legal or an exercise in intimidation to get anticipatory compliance from states remains to be seen. But Governor Ned Lamont is having none of it when it comes to his climate legislative priorities and policies. 
“We’re not going to change what we do,” he said Thursday, during a press briefing about Trump administration cutbacks the state is facing. “If I can mitigate some of the risk by changing some of the wording or titles — why not? I want to protect my kids. I want to protect the money we’re investing to keep you safe from flooding. But we’re not going to change who we are.”
While not mentioning Connecticut specifically, Trump’s executive order does call out states with policies similar to those Connecticut has or is considering. One is the climate change superfund legislation up for consideration this legislative session, which would penalize fossil fuel companies found to be contributing significantly to climate change and use the money collected to fund “climate mitigation, resiliency and adaptation projects.” The order specifies such funds already in place in Vermont and New York, calling them “extortion.”
The order also takes on carbon fees — specifically California’s cap-and-trade program, which is similar to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI, that Connecticut  participates in along with the rest of New England and many mid-Atlantic states since its inception in 2009.
But the question of whether the executive order carries any legal heft gets an unambiguous response from environmental legal experts contacted by the Connecticut Mirror.
“No, no, no,” said Patrick Parenteau, professor emeritus at the Environmental Law Center at Vermont Law School. “It’s an email to Pam Bondi, saying, ‘Pam, see if you can find a way to challenge these states that are enacting all these laws and bringing all these lawsuits that I don’t like,” he said. “Let’s not give it any more gravitas than that. It’s an email.”
Brad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation and a former Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, regional administrator and trial attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice, called it “more political theater than it is law.”
“The executive order provides no legal rationale for why any of the categories of laws it’s attacking are unlawful or unconstitutional” he said. “I pity the DOJ attorney who has to come up with a legal basis for these types of challenges.”
The President has no authority to cancel a state program or tell a state to change its laws or cancel its regulations or anything like that. He can’t. He simply can’t do that.”Michael Gerrard, Director of Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, Columbia University
“The EO is so outrageous that we cannot speculate as to legal theories that they may assert in challenging our state’s climate policies,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong in an email. He also said it had no legal effect. “We do not think there is any basis in law to attack individual state’s ability to make the necessary policy choices to protect their citizens and the environment.”
Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School said: “The President has no authority to cancel a state program or tell a state to change its laws or cancel its regulations or anything like that. He can’t. He simply can’t do that.”
Gerrard and others said Congress can pass laws to change policy, but under current conditions is unlikely to get 60 votes in the Senate. The EPA can also issue regulations following all the required and lengthy rules to do so.
But if EPA or the White House were to tell Connecticut to stop doing what they’re doing, Gerrard said, “hopefully their response would be to say ‘no.’ And if EPA really insisted, hopefully the answer would be, ‘see you in court.’”
Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative, also at the Sabin Center, said while the order is toothless, “what I worry a lot about are purple-er states and also local governments,” she said. “If a local policy is challenged in any one of the ways that might come about as a result of this exercise, it seems relatively likely that they would drop that policy. They don’t have the resources to engage in litigation.
“I’m quite worried about the chilling effect that this will have at the local level.”
Campbell thought it would likely “give some legislators pause in strengthening current law, particularly if it falls into, or arguably falls into, one of Trump’s targeted categories,” he said. “I think other state officials will worry that if they take bolder action in any of the areas this executive order targets, it’ll lead to funding cuts or other denials of federal resources or protections.”
Connecticut doesn’t appear cowed at this point. 
In addition to Lamont, Charles Rothenberger, director of Connecticut government relations for Save the Sound, said he isn’t worried. 
“We’re not going to repeal anything that we currently have on the books,” he said. “I don’t necessarily see anybody getting cold feet because of the noise coming out of Washington.”
Rep. Steve Winter, D-New Haven, and co-sponsor of the climate change superfund legislation, said he thought the executive order was designed as intimidation. 
“I would hope that colleagues in the legislature would stay true to the values that make us who we are,” Winter said. “I think the overreach here really is at the federal level, whether it’s trying to dictate to the states what education policy looks like, [or] what climate change and resilience policy looks like.”
House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, who is an attorney, pointed to the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which says that whatever powers aren’t explicitly given to the federal government or withheld from the states are reserved to the states. Adherence to states rights has been the bedrock of the Republican party for decades, but critics contend the administration is abandoning that position. 
“I think that the 10th Amendment could be under attack, based on what we’re seeing,” Candelora said.
“To the extent that the federal government wants to look at whether a state’s law is constitutional or not, I don’t necessarily have an issue with that,” he said, noting that, for instance, he has long felt Connecticut’s marijuana laws should have been pre-empted by federal law.
“When I look at this order, and I look at it through the lens of Connecticut, I don’t think Connecticut has done anything on an environmental level that is preempted by federal [law] and I would just be concerned if this was used in a more broad sense to go after states,” Candelora said.
Connecticut doesn’t have as many ambitious climate initiatives on the books as some of its neighbors like Massachusetts and New York, so there’s less for the Trump administration to go after.
The state has targets, including a zero carbon electric grid by 2040, and a benchmark for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to reach 80% below 2001 levels by 2050. One of Connecticut’s two big climate bills this session seeks to strengthen that metric along with the bill’s renewable energy and energy efficiency provisions. The other focuses on resiliency. Both are largely comprised of provisions from legislation that failed over the last two sessions.
The state’s commitment to offshore wind has also waned, with one wind farm under construction and nothing more planned. That’s in contrast to neighboring states with more ambitious offshore wind goals and projects still awaiting permits.
The state did not place an official ban on gas hookups and is no longer using the strictest motor vehicle emissions permitted under the Clean Air Act.
But a cap-and-invest program for the electric sector known as RGGI (pronounced reggie), which Connecticut has long championed, could provide a target. That program allows power plants over a certain size to essentially pay for the right to pollute. The allowances to do that are then sold through an auction, with proceeds going to the states for use in clean energy and energy efficiency projects.
Since RGGI started through 2022 (the last data available), Connecticut invested $288 million. About 70% has gone to energy efficiency through the Energy Efficiency Board, with 23% allocated to the Connecticut Green Bank. The rest is used for administration of the program.

“You can always file a lawsuit,” said Parenteau at Vermont Law School. “The real question is, what is Pam Bondi going to tell the president she has the capacity to do and what are the priorities to deploy her resources, which are shrinking by the day because she’s firing people, people are leaving DOJ, etc. So I think RGGI would rank way down somewhere at the very bottom of the list of targets.” 
He said she’d be much more likely to go after California’s cap-and-trade.
“I’m not sure that RGGI preempts any federal laws or would be unconstitutional,” Candelora said. “I would think ultimately the state of Connecticut would prevail. And I just have a global concern that we are in general — and I use this across the board with both political parties — that we over-utilize the courts now.”
For Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes, who has been Connecticut’s point-person on RGGI going back to her first position as deputy commissioner for energy at DEEP, the track record is clear — money saved and a 53% reduction in emissions.
“It’s on a solid foundation” she said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)I am the grandson of Elaine Abraham, founder of Native Student Services at the University of Alaska Anchorage, as well as a former student and NSS member. The current restructure of the NSS and the removal of staff members that happened really concerns me.
My grandmother had a long legacy of serving the University of Alaska and helping it grow. She was the first woman and first Alaska Native to hold a senior position in the university’s statewide administration. As the vice president for Rural Education Affairs, she helped expand the UA system to Nome, Barrow, Tanana, Kotzebue, Sitka, Ketchikan, Valdez, Kodiak and the Aleutians. With her work building Native Student Services in Anchorage, she brought in hundreds of Alaska Native students and supported them in successful educations. As her caretaker for the last 10 years of her life, I met dozens of UAA alumni who would come to thank her directly for her work and they would attribute their degree completion directly to NSS. In my own experience as a student, the NSS was a unique, safe place where I felt culturally understood and supported by both Native staff and student peers. It was a home away from home when the transition from my village of Yakutat to the city of Anchorage was difficult and overwhelming at times. I have heard this experience echoed by many, many other Alaska Native students.
Part of the About UAA page states: “Striving to be a place where every person who wants an education can be successful, UAA transforms the lives of its students and communities, while honoring our locations on the ancestral lands of Alaska’s First Peoples.” Keeping NSS in its current form is essential to making this statement true and would honor the legacy of my grandmother and the work she did for the university.
University leaders would honor Alaska Native students if they would:

Keep Native Student Services as it is, an independent office that offers support and services to Native students.
Ensure current staff members stay permanently, properly compensated and given the support needed to run NSS.
Change who NSS reports to, moving them to the Office of Student Success.
Ensure student worker positions, including tutors, are kept and funded.
Ensure all positions at NSS have long-term stability and credibility.
Keep Native Student Services as its own organization, not underneath another department or office at UAA.

Gunalchéesh, Thank you.

(Photo by Jennifer Smith/CommonWealth Beacon)At some point between February and early March, as seasonal wind and rain hammered New England coasts, a relatively new but enthusiastically embraced tool for predicting erosion slipped off the Federal Emergency Management Agency website.

This article first appeared on CommonWealth Beacon and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

Pioneered on Nantucket in 2020, the Coastal Erosion Hazard viewer that covered all of New England is now unavailable. It predicted erosion risk across the coast for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, and until recently was publicly accessible on an online map used by planners and individuals alike.
“The tool was really helpful,” said Leah Hill, Nantucket’s coastal resilience coordinator, “because erosion is episodic. So, an area can be stable for five, 10, 15 years, maybe lose like a foot [of beach] or so, or nothing, and then a storm could come and it could lose a bunch.”
Historical erosion data and flood maps kept by the state are useful, she said, but the FEMA maps incorporated sea level rise to project potential future erosion over time.  The Biden administration promoted the tool for homeowners, business owners, and community officials making resiliency decisions based on erosion concerns.
Hill is acutely aware of climate risks to the small island, which has one of the highest erosion rates in the state. These erosion maps, which resulted in a detailed Nantucket erosion assessment, have become baked into her work to inform residents about their property risks.
“Prospective homeowners or homeowners will call me and say, ‘You know, I’m thinking about purchasing this property. What are the risks associated with it?’” Hill said. “I’ll create, using the best available data, a risk assessment for that property. I don’t give real estate advice, but I can tell them about certain risk criteria. … And in order to do so, I use the FEMA erosion projection maps.”
When Hill went to the site in early March, the page that used to open up the ArcGIS erosion maps instead took her to a login screen with no way to access the maps. When the maps remained inaccessible for weeks, she reached out to the Woods Hole Sea Grant for help connecting with the FEMA Region 1 team, which covers New England, receiving a brief email response on March 24.
“FEMA is currently taking swift action to ensure the alignment with President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s direction,” wrote Kerry Bogdan, the risk analysis branch chief at FEMA Region 1. “To that end, FEMA Region 1’s Coastal Erosion Hazard viewer will be unavailable at this time.”
FEMA did not respond to request for comment on the timing or rationale of removing the maps.
Business magazine Fast Company reported that two software engineers were able to save and recreate data from FEMA’s Future Risk Index tool when it, too, quietly vanished in February. The index mapped the projected economic losses from climate change down to the county level, based on hazards like flooding, drought, heat waves, and wildfires under different emissions scenarios.
The FEMA future erosion maps are what’s known as “non-regulatory products,” essentially tools that are designed to be accessible and user-friendly, geared toward communicating information to the public, while regulatory products like FEMA floodplain maps are required by law and determine floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance policy.
For instance, if a building is in a FEMA regulatory floodplain, there may be rules for resiliency improvements. But if a parcel is a long-term future erosion risk, the way to protect it or develop it is often up to the owner’s discretion and informed by the available public information.
“I’m scrambling a little bit,” Hill said. She saved some of the GIS maps, but not all of them, and it isn’t yet clear if the data sets have been saved elsewhere.
The map scrubbing is an abrupt about-face on federal data sets, just six months after the federal government touted them as a way to help people plan for a future in the face of climate change.
Bogdan told The Connecticut Mirror in September 2024 that an assortment of FEMA tools like erosion maps and forward-looking flood risk maps offered critical and helpful insights for municipalities and individuals alike.
“They’re not going to tell you where you can develop, how to develop, what your insurance rate should be, but they are going to convey that hazard risk,” Bogdan said. “What the risk is so people can plan for it.”
Communities have incorporated the erosion map viewer with enthusiasm, she said.
“Some of our severely impacted communities from coastal erosion have really embraced this tool, and they’re incorporating it into their long-term planning for things like grid retreat, placement of utilities, water lines, gas lines, that kind of stuff,” Bogdan told The Mirror.
The Trump administration has, in its first three months, taken steps to roll back policies around climate resiliency planning. On March 25, FEMA announced that it stopped implementing certain floodplain management requirements for federally funded projects.
This Obama-era standard, which was a mechanism for federal agencies to manage risk by requiring federally funded projects to be located out of flood risk areas or constructed to reduce the effects of current and future flood hazards, was halted under the first Trump administration, reinstated by Biden, and is now off again.
“Stopping implementation will reduce the total timeline to rebuild in disaster-impacted communities and eliminate additional costs previously required to adhere to these strict requirements,” the FEMA announcement said in late March.
Last week, FEMA announced that it is ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which has given states and communities billions of dollars to protect against natural disasters. The agency is also canceling all BRIC applications from fiscal years 2020-2023. FEMA said the BRIC program is “more concerned with climate change than helping Americans affected by natural disasters” in a statement announcing the cuts.
There has been no official statement on removing public mapping software that anticipates future flood or erosion risk. Other pages removed include the agency’s 2022 “Guide to Expanding Mitigation: Making the Connection to the Coast,” which supplied emergency managers, community planners, coastal and floodplain managers, and other community stakeholders with resources and ideas to mitigate risk.
A banner atop FEMA’s website reads: “FEMA.gov is being updated to comply with President Trump’s Executive Orders. Thank you for your patience and understanding.”
Shannon Hulst, a floodplain and community rating system specialist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Sea Grant and Cape Cod Cooperative Extension, who was able to connect Hill with FEMA Region 1, said ad-hoc data removal is cause for concern.
“It’s disconcerting,” said Hulst, who works on projects like developing flood insurance programs for towns along Cape Cod. “And it certainly can make our jobs more challenging. I know, on our end, we’re working on downloading some of that data to make sure we continue to have access to it.”
In her capacity, Hulst mostly relies on regulatory products like the floodplain maps, which are “a whole different ball game.” There is no word that the flood maps will be taken down, Hulst said, and Massachusetts keeps state-level flood maps as back-up.
“We’ll still be OK with that data,” she said of the flood maps, but the disappearance of solid predictive data is an issue for consistent long-term planning. “When we know that there is a risk, and that is what we were using as the best available data to inform us about that risk, and we’re trying to manage our communities to the best of our ability to protect ourselves from that risk,” she said, “it makes it difficult.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s U.S. House delegation all voted this week in favor of legislation requiring states to obtain U.S. citizenship proof from people registering to vote in federal elections.
Also this week, an Iowa senator advanced a proposal aimed at enforcement of antitrust laws in the meatpacking industry.
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act passed the House Thursday on a 220-208 vote, largely along party lines, with four Democrats supporting the measure. Iowa’s four U.S. representatives, all Republicans, voted in support of the measure that would require people present proof of their U.S. citizenship to register to vote. Accepted documents would include photo IDs issued by federal, state or tribal governments that show a person was born in the U.S. like U.S. passports, or documents like a birth certificate or certificate of naturalization.
Voting in U.S. elections is already illegal for those who are not U.S. citizens. But members of Iowa’s federal delegation said the measure will prevent noncitizens from participating in elections — a common talking point for conservatives, including President Donald Trump, when questioning the integrity of American elections. The bill was passed weeks after Trump signed an executive order requiring citizenship proof for voter registration.
Rep. Randy Feenstra released a statement saying the bill will help ensure election integrity.
“Only American citizens should be allowed to vote in American elections. It’s why I voted to ban illegal immigrants from voting in our elections and ensure that liberal states like California clean their voter rolls of noncitizens,” Feenstra said. “Keeping noncitizens and illegal immigrants from unlawfully voting is the least we can do to secure our elections.”
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who cosponsored the earlier version of the bill passed by the House in 2024, said in a news release that the bill guarantees “American elections should be decided by American citizens.”
“The SAVE Act is a commonsense measure that ensures proof of citizenship is required to register for federal elections and gives states the tools they need to keep non-citizens off the voter rolls,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “I’m proud to lead on this issue and help restore confidence in our elections.”
The federal legislation comes as Iowa state lawmakers sent a bill to the governor allowing the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, as well as private entities, to confirm U.S. citizenship status of people on Iowa’s voter rolls, and that would allow voters to be challenged at the polls on their citizenship status.
Democrats have criticized the measure, stating that instances of noncitizens illegally voting in U.S. elections are rare, but that the proof of citizenship requirements will cause problems for many legal U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote — including married women who have changed their last name but not yet updated their name on legal documents.
Rep. Joe Morelle, D-New York, said in a statement that the bill was “one of the most damaging voter suppression bills in modern history.”
“There’s no doubt that women, military members, and people of color will be disproportionately impacted,” Morelle said. “The fight to stop this bill — to protect Americans’ sacred right to vote — is not over. I will do everything in my power to ensure every eligible American has access to the ballot box.”
The measure must pass the U.S. Senate before heading to Trump.
Grassley legislation focuses on meatpacking industry competition
Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced legislation Wednesday to increase enforcement of antitrust laws in the meatpacking industry, a step he said would help bring down the price of meat.
The Meat and Poultry Special Investigator Act would establish a team of investigators in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tasked with ensuring compliance with existing federal laws banning anticompetitive practices in the meatpacking industry. The investigators, working with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, would have subpoena power and be able to bring court action against meatpackers and poultry dealers for violations of Packers and Stockyards Act.
A news release from Grassley’s office stated the measure was needed considering the substantial consolidation of the meatpacking industry in recent decades. Four companies currently control 85% of the beef market and 67% of the pork market, compared to controlling 36% and 34% of the markets respectively in 1980, according to Grassley’s office. Having four companies with such a large portion of control in the industry has “created a distorted marketplace through anticompetitive practices” at the expense of livestock and poultry producers, the news release stated.
Grassley said the bill, endorsed by the National Farmers Union and the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association, will help Iowa livestock farmers while bringing down grocery store prices.
“For decades, America’s Big Four meatpackers’ anticompetitive practices have made it harder for Iowa cattle producers to receive a fair price,” Grassley said in a statement. “Our bill empowers USDA, in coordination with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, to crack down on bad actors, ensuring a fair and functional marketplace that supports everyone who produces and enjoys quality American meat.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Redfield-voting-precinct-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-11 16:11:26.830035

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”
Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
Public debate
Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.




It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician



From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
Making the connection
Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will remove gender dysphoria from disabilities protected under federal law, but it’s still unclear whether 17 Republican state attorneys general will continue a related lawsuit that could dismantle federal protections for all people with disabilities.
Last fall, Texas GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the federal government over the Biden administration’s addition of a gender identity-related disorder to the disabilities protected under a portion of federal law known as Section 504.
Republican attorneys general from 16 other states joined the lawsuit: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and West Virginia.
But they  faced a swift backlash earlier this year. Disability advocates pointed to parts of their lawsuit that asked the court to find all of Section 504 unconstitutional, not just the update that included gender dysphoria.
If the court agrees, advocates fear that schools, workplaces, hospitals and other entities could refuse to provide disability accommodations they’ve been required to provide for the past 50 years.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

AGs hurried to distance themselves. Arkansas Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin, Georgia Republican Attorney General Chris Carr and others adamantly denied that interpretation and said their only goal was to remove protections for people with gender dysphoria.
The new HHS ruling seems to achieve what the AGs said they wanted. It essentially declares that the Biden update adding gender dysphoria to disability law can’t be enforced.
But the broad language of the lawsuit leaves open the possibility, some experts say, for the court to strike down the entirety of Section 504 protections.
The state AGs’ position should become clearer in a few days. They’re scheduled to file an update with the court on April 21.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is calling on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to allow Ukrainians with temporary protected status to remain in the country, following reports people had received an email that their status was revoked and they had seven days to leave the U.S. The agency has said the April 3 notice […]","Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaks at a fisheries forum on Oct. 4, 2022. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is calling on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to allow Ukrainians with temporary protected status to remain in the country, following reports people had received an email that their status was revoked and they had seven days to leave the U.S.
The agency has said the April 3 notice was issued by mistake, and the Ukrainians’ designation under what’s known as “humanitarian parole status” has not been terminated. They had been granted the status under the “Uniting for Ukraine” program. 
But Murkowski penned a strongly worded letter on Sunday, with U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem condemning the move, even if it was “apparently an error.” 
“Even if this message was sent in error, threatening the abrupt termination of humanitarian parole for Ukrainians is alarming and adverse to the U.S. national interest,” they wrote. 
Humanitarian parole is a temporary immigration status granted to those fleeing humanitarian crises, and can be revoked at any time. There were 651,000 Ukrainians granted humanitarian parole in the United States last year. An estimated 6.9 million Ukrainians have been displaced since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
“Ukrainians who have participated in the Uniting for Ukraine program have entered the U.S. lawfully, passed rigorous screening and vetting requirements,” the senators wrote. “These are individuals, including children, who have fled a war zone and followed a lawful process. Many are working in our states, paying taxes and contributing to local communities.” 
Murkowski and Shaheen also requested a briefing on any future plans regarding the Ukrainians’ status. 
“We urge the agency to provide immediate clarification to Ukrainians in the United States that their humanitarian parole has not been terminated, and that there are no plans to terminate the program while Ukraine is still under active attack by Russia,” they said.
The agency’s notice to those with humanitarian parole began: “It is time for you to leave the United States,” and the recipient’s parole would be terminated in seven days. “If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States — unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here.”
Ukrainians have been the largest group of refugees arriving in Alaska over the last three years, according to Issa Spatrisano, the Alaska state refugee coordinator with Catholic Relief Services, a resettlement agency. 
Spatrisano said she has received several reports of people in Alaska receiving the DHS termination notice, and the news spread secondhand very quickly. She said the effect was chilling. 
“The email was very scary for Ukrainians living in Alaska and across the country,” she said. “Because they really are at the whims of at any point an announcement coming from DHS, and when that announcement is made, they’ll have to respond accordingly to what the announcement is.”
An estimated 1,500 Ukrainians have arrived since 2022, about 500 people per year, Spatrisano said. Many joined family members, communities, and the workforce, “really much needed jobs throughout the state,” she said. But the uncertainty takes a toll.
“A mental health toll,” she said. “It takes a serious toll on people’s well being, and that impacts on our state. There are Ukrainian families who are in the process of buying homes here in Alaska, you know, in the process of laying down roots, in the process of getting job training programs to advance in jobs that the state frankly needs really badly. And those are all investments in time and in energy and in resources that families are now wondering if they should do.” 
Murkowski and Shaheen have asked for “an immediate explanation as to how these emails were sent in error” and “that there are no plans to terminate the program while Ukraine is still under active attack by Russia.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The head of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management sent a memo last week ordering local officials to gather personal data about immigrants they suspected of living in the country without authorization, even those who aren’t arrested.
DEM Director Kevin Guthrie’s previously unreported directive went too far for sheriffs in the new State Immigration Enforcement Council, who told Florida Phoenix they found out about the agency’s involvement in data collection for immigration enforcement after the memo went into effect on April 1.
Law enforcement stopped implementation of the March 31 memo after sheriffs voiced their objections. Police would’ve had to file forms including people’s addresses, employers, phone numbers, criminal history, and picture, if they suspected a person they came in contact with lacked legal status in this country, according to the memo obtained by the Phoenix.
DEM also required data collection when police questioned but didn’t detain or arrest someone. The statute cited in the memo gives the emergency management agency authority to collect data on major fires, airplane crashes, bomb threats, natural disasters, and other large-scale incidents.
Sheriffs oppose data sharing DEM proposed

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who chairs the immigration enforcement council, said during the group’s second meeting Wednesday that Guthrie’s directive contained a “fatal flaw” — it skipped the local law enforcement chains of command, blocking them from supervising their officers.
“They were just eager to collect the data. Once again, there was no malice,” Judd said in a phone interview with the Phoenix Wednesday. “It was just everybody wanting to be game-on and immediately respond to the mission that was given to us.”
Judd agreed that data collection should be narrower and only for people the federal government lacks information on.
“We’ve got to get our sea legs under us,” he said.
The sensitivity of the data sought also concerned Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who said the state shouldn’t aim to duplicate information the federal government already has. Senate President Ben Albritton nominated Gualtieri to the council.
“It was clunky, because we don’t submit information, especially some of that information in there is confidential information like criminal history information, that we would be prohibited by law from submitting to emergency managers,” Gualtieri said in a phone interview.
State immigration director: Mass deportations will require emergency agency to house migrants

However, the memo underscores a growing involvement by the emergency agency in new internal immigration enforcement efforts that the DeSantis administration is ramping up to help President Donald Trump carry out mass deportations by collaborating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Larry Keefe, whom DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet appointed as executive director of the State Immigration Enforcement Board, said he’d pitched the Trump administration on a plan to let the DEM house and transport immigrants awaiting deportation.
“We have the world-class, absolute best in Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Division of Emergency Management, and he is really good about safely moving people and stuff around in high-stress, high-pressure emergency situations, including soft-sided facilities, hard-sided facilities — whatever the state of the art is, and in the planet Earth on how to house people and move people and feed people, and treat people safely and well, he knows it,” Keefe said during the council’s first meeting on March 31, the same day Guthrie sent the memo on data collection of immigrants.
House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters he had not been briefed about plans for DEM to house immigrants.

Immigration enforcement council works on guidelines
The pause on the DEM memo doesn’t mean local law enforcement won’t collect information about immigrants. The council, comprising four sheriffs and four police chiefs, is still crafting guidelines for how police should collect data and report it to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the immigration enforcement board. The council’s next meeting is set for April 16.
“We have to be very careful that our mission doesn’t creep into being ICE junior,” said Naples Police Chief Ciro Dominguez during the Wednesday meeting. “It’s not good for us to get in that role. As the sheriff said, we’re here to help ICE, but we shouldn’t try to be ICE. That’s gonna go back on what we’re all trying to do in our communities.”
Concurrently, the council is working on guidelines to disburse the $250 million for a grant program local law enforcement agencies can qualify for to pay overtime for officers who will soon start a 40-hour training program to qualify for federal authorization to act as immigration enforcement officials.
Out of the nearly 200 agreements with ICE that sheriffs’ offices, state agencies, and local police departments have entered into so far, only approximately 1,400 Florida Highway Patrol troopers have completed the online training and are set to gain the federal certification.
However, the immigration enforcement board, comprising Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, must approve the guidelines from the council.
DEM did not respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment.

,DC,2025-04-11 19:24:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,DOJ ordered to give daily updates in standoff with judge over wrongly deported Maryland man,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/doj-ordered-give-daily-updates-standoff-judge-over-wrongly-deported-maryland-man,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge Friday demanded daily reports from the Trump administration on how it is working to return an erroneously deported Maryland man from an El Salvador prison, despite objections from a Department of Justice lawyer who insisted the Trump administration could not immediately obey a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.The Maryland judge’s order came after the high court Thursday night ruled the Trump administration must try to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, of Beltsville, but stopped short of requiring he be brought back from the notorious mega-prison.The unsigned order from the Supreme Court said the district court also needs to clarify what it meant by saying the administration must “effectuate” the return of Abrego Garcia and the scope of that term is “unclear” and may exceed the district court’s authority.Immigration officials admitted to an “administrative error” in the March 15 deportation of Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite protections from removal to his home country placed in 2019 by an immigration judge.U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of the District of Maryland grilled DOJ attorney Drew Ensign on where Abrego Garcia was currently and what steps President Donald Trump’s administration had taken to return him to the United States.Ensign said he could not answer those questions and instead requested more time because the administration is currently “vetting what we can say” in court. He also objected to the requirement to submit daily updates.Xinis, who earlier set a deadline, now expired, for the government to bring back Abrego Garcia, was critical of that response.“The record as it stands is, despite this court’s directive … your clients have done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia,” she said.Xinis said she would schedule a hearing for early next week.“We’re not going to slow walk this,” she said.She continued to ask Ensign where Abrego Garcia was located.Ensign said he had no information.“It’s quite basic,” she said. “I'm not asking for state secrets.”CECOT prisonAdministration officials have said Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador's government at the notorious prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.  The Beltsville man was apprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while driving his 5-year-old son home.El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, is visiting the White House Monday to meet with President Donald Trump.The attorney representing Abrego Garcia’s family, Simon Y. Sandoval-Moshenberg, said he would welcome daily updates on what the Trump administration is doing to facilitate his client’s return.“It’s quite clear that the government is playing a game with their own lawyers,” he said, noting that this is the second time he has faced a DOJ attorney who claimed he had little information for Xinis.Attorney General Pam Bondi said the attorney that originally argued on behalf of the government, Erez Reuveni, was placed on administrative leave for not ""vigorously"" defending the Trump administration.Reuveni was candid with Xinis about how the Trump administration gave him no information as to why Abrego Garcia could not be returned, despite admitting to his deportation as a mistake.Administration official rejects district court authorityMeanwhile, Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser, rejected the judge’s authority to require the return of Abrego Garcio in a social media post after the high court decision.“SCOTUS rejected the lower court and made clear that a district court judge cannot exercise Article II foreign affairs powers. The illegal alien terrorist is in the custody and control of a sovereign foreign nation,” Miller wrote.While the Trump administration has labeled Abrego Garcia as a member of the MS-13 gang, he has no criminal record in the U.S. or any country.Before Friday’s hearing, the Department of Justice had sought a delay until Wednesday, which Xinis rejected in a searing order.“First, the Defendants’ act of sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador was wholly illegal from the moment it happened, and Defendants have been on notice of the same,” she wrote. “Second, the Defendants’ suggestion that they need time to meaningfully review a four-page (Supreme Court) Order that reaffirms this basic principle blinks at reality.”She said the Department of Justice should have been making efforts to return Abrego Garcia after her decision last week ordering them to do so.During the hearing she asked Ensign what progress the Trump administration made before the Supreme Court stayed the deadline she had set — so from April 4 until April 7.Ensign said that the Trump administration was “not yet prepared to share that information.”",,,,2025-04-11 16:11:26.830035

Photo: Jim NeugerThis week saw several intense discussions on the floor of the Maine Senate and House of Representatives about bills related to energy and vaccines, among other issues, though there was wide support for emergency legislation to address the critical shortage of public defenders and better prepare the state for extreme weather.
The chambers, however, failed to reconcile their disagreement over whether “Welcome Home” by Winter Harbor resident Gordon Thomas Ward should become the official state anthem. 
Other votes of note:
Following in the tracks of the newly appointed state amphibian (Spring Peeper) and reptile (Wood Turtle), Maine has now designated the Seppala Siberian Sleddog as the Maine State dog. LD 80 passed the Senate 24-8 after passing the House without a roll call.
An effort to rollback a bill passed last session that would prohibit unauthorized paramilitary training (LD 303) was rejected, with the House voting 74-72 and the Senate voting 19-14 in favor of the committee recommendation against the bill. During debate, Rep. Katrina Smith (R-Palermo) asked, if two or more people are gathered to blow up a Tesla, “are they paramilitary?” To which Rep. Travis Hasenfus (D-Readfield) said that if all the elements are there, they could be charged under this statute.
​​The majority of the Senate and House both voted against legislation (LD 601) introduced by Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Searsport) that would remove the requirement for a popular referendum to start a new nuclear power project in Maine. During the House debate on the measure, Paul, who has introduced several bills that would help ease the return of nuclear energy in Maine, said it was not equitable to artificially stifle one potential energy source.
Another Paul bill that would extend existing conservation easement protections to cover more of Sears Island was also struck down. However, before the Senate voted 24-9 in favor of the Energy Committee’s recommendation against LD 226 (following last week’s 76-68 vote in the House), Senate Democrats had a tense debate over the bill, which could have impacted the future establishment of a controversial wind port on the island. 
Sen. Nicole Grohowski of Hancock County, who voted against the measure, said the process behind selecting Sears Island “was not transparent,” and said the vote is about the future of our natural heritage, our waterfronts and “the integrity of decision making.”
Sen. Denise Tepler of Sagadahoc County, who supported the measure, said it is not necessarily about wind development. Right now there is no money and no possibility for offshore wind development at this site, she said, referring to the Trump administration’s opposition to developing offshore wind. Tepler said the legislation is about preserving a Maine port possibility and the option for MDOT to have the site available should a marine port be needed.
The majority of the Legislature rejected several bills that would have rolled back laws meant to reduce waste from single-use bags. Lawmakers voted to back the committee recommendation against repealing the 5 cent plastic bag fee (LD 56) and against repealing the law to restrict the use of certain single-use bags (LD 69).
Legislation (LD 633) that would require investor-owned utility companies to include in their emergency response a plan to identify and reconnect customers who require electricity for medical equipment passed the House 103-41 and Senate 20-14.
Just two senators (Republican Sens. Scott Cyrway and David Haggan) and 27 House Republicans voted against a measure (LD 580) to protect Maine consumers by prohibiting fees charged for receiving paper statements from financial institutions and credit card issuers. Bill sponsor Sen. Donna Bailey of York County said a constituent brought this issue to her attention and said the practice is “unfair to our older Mainers in particular or anyone who doesn’t have reliable internet access.” 
The majority of lawmakers also voted against a provision that would amend the Natural Resources Protection Act to allow for permits for the fortification of homes located on a coastal sand or coastal wetland (LD 488) and another that would require the Department of Environmental Protection, when adopting rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to issue an estimate of the costs associated with the reduction in emissions that will be borne by consumers (LD 495). You can read more about that proposal here.
The Legislature passed several emergency bills, including LD 5, which would clarify the law regarding prior authorization for air ambulances and LD 466, an act to extend the law governing electric power and service residential rates for military veterans’ organizations.
Senate action
The Senate on Tuesday took several unanimous confirmation votes, confirming Carl Wilson as the new commissioner of the Department of Maine Resources and Andre Briere as executive director of Maine Turnpike Authority; as well Donald Tardie, Jenny Lea Ward, and Hailey Fardon to the Maine Land Use Planning Commission.
The chamber also reconfirmed Phil Bartlett as chair of the Public Utilities Commission, though that nomination faced pushback from some Republicans over Bartlett’s past support for net energy billing.
House action
Before the House voted 79-66 Thursday to accept the committee recommendation against the bill, lawmakers had a spirited debate about LD 436, which would prevent any state agency from providing informational or educational materials about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under 18. (Read more about the bill here). Several Republicans took to the floor to argue the COVID-19 vaccine is not safe or effective, with Smith describing it as “criminal” to promote the vaccine to children. Rep. Sam Zager (D-Portland), a family medicine doctor, said the bill is not about a mandate, but rather whether the state could promote covid vaccination so patients and families can decide for themselves.
Committee votes
The Environment and Natural Resources Committee moved forward with a plan to adjust a mining law that lawmakers changed last year to pave the way for the extraction of a significant cache of lithium, a key component of low-emission energy technology. LD 795 received a unanimous vote, with one member absent, on Wednesday. It would allow for people to get waivers for hobby mining, so long as other restrictions are met, but the bill was amended to allow only previous waiver holders to receive a new waiver.

Armed Forces Brewing Company, the lightning-rod military tribute beer company that closed operations in Norfolk last month, is teetering on the brink of survival.
In an April 4 Securities and Exchange Commission filing and in emails to investors, Chief Executive Officer Alan Beal reported that the company was $1.7 million in debt, despite raising millions in recent years, and needs $2 million of investment by April 29 or it may permanently cease operations or file for bankruptcy.
The brewery closed its taproom last month a year after opening. That followed a controversial launch after hundreds of community members opposed what they said was a divisive business whose marketing glorified violence, threatened LGBTQ people, and said those with different views don’t love America.
Today, Armed Forces is a brewing company unable to make and distribute beer.
A year after opening, controversial Norfolk brewery closes

The April 4 filing reveals a company in freefall. Norfolk’s City Treasurer padlocked its brewing facility for failure to pay taxes. Its contract brewing partner in Florida stopped production last summer after it failed to pay its bills. Three of the four board members who remained after an earlier purge have resigned, leaving only Beal. A growing number of creditors are suing or threatening legal action. The building, owned by a company controlled by New Jersey entrepreneurs (Armed Forces owns 28%), is on the market for $5.45 million, $2 million more than the 2023 purchase price, according to city records. Now, some who have invested money into the venture are rebelling.
Maryland investor and Navy veteran Jeffrey Allen Davis said after he posted on Facebook about exploring a class-action suit that he heard from numerous others who were also interested in taking action against the company. While he doesn’t expect to get back his investment, he and other disappointed investors plan to create a website and explore their legal options.
“He’s a fraudster,” Davis, a refrigerator engineer and eight-year veteran who invested $1,000, said of Beal. “He’s just a scam artist.”
Davis was one of the investors whom Beal emailed recently, begging for money to stay afloat. Beal also took to social media and YouTube on the Survival Dispatch News, a prepper site, to lash out against his detractors even as the SEC filing reveals a company that burned through more than $8.5 million from investors and still went deeply into debt in just a few years. He also claimed he’d filed criminal charges against some opponents, though The Mercury could find no record of that in local courts. 
“The city treasurer, who appears like many in the city government to sympathize with or to be afraid of the woke mob and their social agenda, with no legal basis whatsoever had locksmiths change the locks on the building we were leasing, and have to this date prevented us from accessing the building and its contents, including a large amount of beer on the premises and in the tanks,” Beal wrote in the SEC filing. “This has caused additional economic damage as we are unable to fulfill contracts to distribute the beer being held hostage by the city’s actions.”
Norfolk Treasurer Daun Hester declined to comment through a spokesperson. Ironbound AFBC Properties LLC, the owner of the property, has paid $47,761 in delinquent property taxes. There is a balance due for fiduciary taxes, which include amusement and food and beverage taxes, that the spokesperson said was not public information. 
Debts and suits accumulating
The tax lien is a fraction of Armed Forces debts. Liens have been filed against it for more than $87,000 by a construction company, more than $10,000 by a fence company, and more than $11,000 by a design company. Lawsuits, according to the SEC filing, have been threatened by three lenders it owes more than $350,000. Ironbound AFBC Properties LLC, owner of the brewery’s building, is owed $321,000 in back rent. Armed Forces also owes the Virginia Department of Labor nearly $27,000 for failing to meet its last employee payroll.
Other bills may be outstanding. Armed Forces ran a promotion with the Norfolk Tides last season. Joe Gregory, the team’s general manager, did not return a call seeking to find out whether it had been paid. 
John Newell, Armed Forces’ former logistics manager, and his wife Martha have filed a warrant of debt in Norfolk General District Court with a hearing date next month. Nicole Couch, the taproom manager who Beal left to tell employees they were closing, said she and others have not received their final paychecks.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Armed Forces’ move to Virginia in July 2023, touting $300,000 in incentives. A spokesman for the Virginia Economic Development Partnership said Armed Forces qualified for $24,500 in hiring support, but did not apply for it. It’s not clear if any other incentives were paid. Sean Washington, Norfolk’s head of economic development, said the city did not provide any funding to the company.
Armed Forces quickly burned through millions
As it began brewing in Norfolk, the company raised about $8.5 million from more than 10,000 investors who paid a minimum of $200 in what was essentially a crowdfunding campaign. Some contributors said their rewards, ranging from stickers to hats, never arrived. Those investors have no voting rights and have received no dividends. The stock cannot be sold on the open market.
Armed Forces lost $1.76 million for the first six months of 2024, according to an SEC filing. The company lost $2.4 million in 2023. 
Armed Forces Brewing does not own the former O’Connor property, according to SEC filings. It is owned 72% by a third party, Ironbound AFBC Properties, LLC. Armed Forces has the remaining 28%, but the SEC filing reports that even if the facility is sold, it’s not clear whether Armed Forces will be paid, or if the proceeds will be applied to the debt.
The third-party owners include Evan Almeida, a principal in Ironbound who was briefly on the Armed Forces board. He has a property investment firm in New Jersey and is also an owner of EmpireATM. He and his brother, Michael, are listed as $50,000 to $99,000 investors on the Armed Forces site. Evan Almeida did not respond to an email seeking comment.
 According to the SEC filing, Armed Forces’ lease with Ironbound called for $549,600 payments in 2024 and 2025.
Beal claimed the company was considering a plan to brew in San Diego, St. Louis, and Florida though it’s not clear how many, if any, employees remain.
 “We plan to relocate to a city and a state that actually loves American values and is pro-business and absent of any woke mob mentality,” he wrote in one of two fundraising emails. 
In another email, Beal said “we have had 80 members of our shareholder family pledge almost $100,000.00 of new investment commitments and another 25 who are in the process of completing approximately $10,000 more towards our $1.7M-$2M funding goal.”
He said any money raised would be held in escrow until the company raised enough to pay off or refinance its debt. If it did not meet the $1.7 million goal, Beal said the funds would be returned.

(Courtesy of the Idaho Chapter Sierra Club) Hawk Sahlein installed 12 solar panels onto his Boise home in December 2023 with the hopes that it would build equity onto his home and promote clean energy. 
The 36-year-old spent $18,000 on panels, even taking out a loan from a credit union to finance the investment. The decision came after speaking to several solar companies about the cost, as well as speaking to other locals with solar panels whose Idaho Power bills reduced after installation.
Sahlein was excited about producing his own energy from the solar panels, but now the thought is “sour,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun. That’s because Idaho Power put in a request with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission to decrease the amount it credits its non-legacy rooftop solar owners, or those who installed their systems after December 2019. 
The change is to ensure Idaho Power is paying equitable prices for the energy it buys, a company spokesperson told the Sun. 
If the rate changes are implemented, Sahlein’s solar panels would barely save him money on his power bill, adding to his expenses on top of the loan he took to pay for the panels. He, and 13,700 other Idaho Power customers, would be impacted by this change. And many others have spent even more on their solar systems at home — ranging from $40,000 to $100,000, according to comments on the Idaho Public Utilities Commission website.

 What are the proposed changes for rooftop solar? 

Some Idahoans have installed rooftop solar because of the credits that reduce the cost of their power bill. When customers with solar power generate more energy than they use, the extra energy is sent to Idaho Power’s grid. The company then credits those individuals for the energy at a set rate, called the export credit rate.
In December 2023, the utilities commission made a final ruling on a new “net billing” program, which requires that Idaho Power file an updated export credit rate each year on April 1. Solar advocates and owners said this year’s proposed change in rates is drastic.
“People in Idaho go solar because it lowers their power bills, gives them energy freedom and security, and helps the environment,” Alex McKinley, the owner of Empowered Solar, said in an Idaho Sierra Club press release. “Idaho Power is trying to take that opportunity away from people by skewing these rooftop solar rates in its favor. It’s not right.”
The credit rate varies depending on when the energy demand is the highest in the year, such as in the summer months — June 1 to Sept. 30.
Idaho Power currently has the export credit rate set at: 

Summer on-peak hours: 16.99 cents/kWh
Summer off-peak hours: 5.6 cents/kWh
Non-summer: 4.8 cents/kWh

The proposed export credit rate, which the commission will change by June 1, is: 

Summer on-peak hours : 14.05 cents/kWh
Summer off-peak hours: 1.76 cents/kWh
Non-summer: 0.959 cents/kWh

“I looked at the rates they’re proposing, and it’s bad,” Sahlein said. “It’s less than one cent per kilowatt hour in the non-summer months, so it’s like an 80% drop in the credit on any non-summer day or time. That’s wild to me.”
Sahlein said the changes would make it hard for him to break even on his investment. 
 Proposed rates ensure Idaho Power pays fair market prices, spokesman says

Idaho Power spokesman Jordan Rodriguez said the main reason behind the decrease in credit rates is that 2024 saw lower energy market prices compared to the 2022 market prices used to determine the current rates.
“The (export credit rate) reflects the market value of the energy at the time it is exported to Idaho Power, combined with additional compensation for the benefit on-site generators bring to the grid,” he said.
Solar advocates say utilities proposal contradicts clean energy goals. Idaho Power disagrees.

The change in rates ensures Idaho Power is paying fair market prices for the energy it receives, which are adjusted annually, he said.
“Idaho Power supports clean energy and is using an increasing amount of solar and other clean resources in our energy mix,” he told the Sun. “On-site generation has the potential to reduce how much energy Idaho Power needs to generate or purchase during some hours of some days, but it’s not sufficient to meet all our needs and is non-firm power, meaning there is no guarantee it will be generating and available when we need it.”
The change would affect residents without legacy status, as well as large commercial, industrial, or irrigation customers who installed systems after December 2020, and Oregon customers who installed solar panels after June 2024. 
Rodriguez said 5,300 out of 19,000 Idaho Power customers have legacy status, so they would not be impacted. 
Individuals wanting to leave feedback on the proposed changes can leave comments on the Idaho Public Utilities Commission’s website, using the case number IPC-E-25-15. The commission is expected to make a decision before the new rates take effect on June 1.

DemasThe Michigan Supreme Court determined Thursday that 19- and 20-year olds can’t be automatically sentenced to life without possibility of parole for murder, and individuals who’ve been sentenced under previous rules can be resentenced.
The 5-2 decision builds upon the court’s 2022 ruling which found that the state’s harshest punishment, life sentences without the possibility of parole, could not automatically be placed on 18-year-olds who commit first-degree murder.
Both decisions came down to a consideration of proportionality of sentencing which included evaluating the neurological development of young adults and considering the magnitude of how long a person will be incarcerated compared to other older offenders who’ve committed the same crimes who will ultimately serve less time.
Ultimately, Michigan’s highest court found that the mandatory life sentences for those convicted of committing  first-degree murder when they were 19- or 20-years-old was unconstitutional as a “harsh and disproportionate punishment”. A dissenting opinion from two of the justices found that the court focused too much on research about brain development and didn’t fully evaluate the severity of the crime of murder.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In comparison to older offenders, the brains of late-adolescent defendants make them more impulsive and prone to reckless actions, the majority opinion penned by Justice Elizabeth Welch reads. But as that erratic nature changes with time, the opinion reasons, those defendants “are capable of significant change” befitting Michigan’s goal of rehabilitation for those convicted.
And that time served will almost certainly be decades longer than other adult defendants who are subject to the mandatory life sentence without parole for the same crime which creates a stark disproportionate punishment between offenders in a move the majority opinion found “constitutionally defective”
“…as a class, 19- and 20-year-old late adolescents are more similar to juveniles in neurological terms than they are to older adults,” the majority opinion reads. “There has long been a scientific consensus that, in terms of neurological development, there is ‘no meaningful distinction’ between a 17-year-old and 18-year-old individual…But the lack of meaningful distinction does not stop at age 18.”
Society in many arenas doesn’t consider late adolescents between the ages of 18 and 21 as “full adults”, the opinion reads, noting age restrictions on alcohol and cannabis possession, until the age of 21, as well as the same age restriction on running for U.S. Senate. 
“Age-based legal rights are a social and civic recognition that age and maturity generally correlate and that as an adolescent matures, they are expected to take on more social and legal responsibilities,” the opinion reads. “Various laws demonstrate that late adolescents between the ages of 18 and 21 exist within a unique transient phase during which society has decided they are mature enough to hold some but not all of the rights and privileges of full adulthood.”
The court’s decision will apply retroactively, allowing those serving sentences for first-degree murder committed when they were 19 or 20-years-old, to request resentencing.

166428_133_01 
In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement, joined by Justice Brian Zahra, wrote that first-degree murder is perhaps the gravest offense addressed in Michigan law and the taking of a life “is an act of the highest moral and legal consequence. A punishment of great severity is therefore proportionate”.
In arguing that young offenders spend a disproportionate amount of time in prison compared to older offenders and that younger offenders’ brains may still be developing in a manner that makes them more prone to change in future behavior, Clement said the majority’s argument focuses on the evaluation of the offender rather than the offense.
“While I recognize that it makes some sense to consider characteristics of the offender in an as-applied challenge, such as that here, I believe the majority unjustifiably allows such considerations to loom so large in its analysis that the majority downplays the gravity of first-degree murder,” the dissenting opinion penned by Clement reads.
Clement and Zahra are the only Republican-nominated justices currently on the bench. Clement announced her intention to step down by the end of April, and will be succeeded by Justice Megan Cavanagh as chief justice.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0403-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-11 16:11:26.830035

Mike Braun on Friday declared a 30-day state of disaster emergency for 18 counties facing tornado and flood damage — a day after the state recorded its 44th tornado of the year.
The declaration allows the Indiana Department of Homeland Security to start providing financial assistance to the impacted communities under Indiana’s disaster relief fund, Braun explained in a news release.
“It is my hope that this step enables residents, businesses, and local government to access needed resources and assistance as they assess and recover from these devastating weather events,” he said.

The declaration covers Bartholomew, Brown, Clark, Crawford, Dearborn, Delaware, Gibson, Hamilton, Harrison, Lake, Madison, Marshall, Martin, Owen, Perry, Posey, Spencer and Warrick counties.
The order itself wasn’t immediately available, Braun’s office said.
Severe thunderstorms on April 2 spawned a whopping 24 tornados in Indiana according to a tracker by the National Weather Service’s Indianapolis office — doubling the state’s tornado tally in just one day.
The service identified wind gusts of more than 80 miles per hour and large hail as primary threats, but heavy rain also prompted flash flood warnings. The flood threat remained “significant” for days, with “major flooding” reported throughout the next week and into Friday.
“Flooding is ongoing across the region and there have been many water rescues,” the service noted on April 5. “Avoid flooded roadways and floodwaters! Turn around, don’t drown!”
Another tornado blew through Gibson County Thursday. Photos via the Gibson County Sheriff’s Department and posted by Indiana State Police showed damage to buildings, vehicles, trees, utility poles, street signs and more.
That brought Indiana’s tornado tally to 44 for the year, the National Weather Service’s Indianapolis office confirmed to the Capital Chronicle on Thursday.

SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois House shot down legislation Thursday that would have allowed some people incarcerated for crimes they committed when they were under 21 to become eligible for release.

In a rare rebuke of a Democrat-sponsored bill, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers voted against House Bill 3332, causing the bill to fail on a 49-51 vote. Bills require 60 votes to pass the House, and numerous Democrats voted against the bill or skipped the vote. The bill was declared “lost,” meaning it cannot be recalled later.

The bill would have allowed people sentenced for crimes they committed when they were under 21 to be eligible for a parole hearing after serving 10 years in prison. Those sentenced for murder would be eligible for parole after serving 20 years, while those sentenced for murdering a victim who was under 18 years would be eligible for parole after serving 30 years.

""This bill would create a pathway for people sentenced as children and young adults to show that they have been rehabilitated and potentially return home and give back to their communities,” bill sponsor Rep. Theresa Mah, D-Chicago, told the House.

Mah declined to comment Friday on the bill’s failure.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law in 2023 that makes anyone sentenced to life in prison while they were under 21 eligible for release after serving 40 years behind bars — but only for people sentenced after June 1, 2019. Mah’s bill aimed to make that law retroactive and provide an opportunity for parole for all people incarcerated for crimes they committed before they were 21.

Illinois previously became one of the first states to abolish parole for crimes committed after 1978. Anyone sentenced for crimes committed between 1979 and early 2019 is not eligible for parole, but state law provides other mechanisms that allow people to have their sentence reduced, such as for good behavior in prison.

Mah’s bill immediately drew heavy criticism from Republicans who objected to creating a path to freedom for people convicted of violent crimes. Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, argued that people serving decades-long sentences for convictions before they turned 21 are likely in prison for murder or major sex crimes.

""With respect to victims, we need to give them finality in the criminal justice system,” Windhorst said. “They should not be having to come back to court to relive the loss they suffered either being a victim of crime or the family of a victim of a murder. There needs to be finality, and we should not be reducing sentences for murderers and those guilty of criminal sexual account.”

Rep. John Cabello, R-Machesney Park, who works for the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Office, recalled serious crimes he investigated in his law enforcement career.

""Murder is brutal. It is final for one person; it’s a lifetime for their family,” Cabello said. “We can’t allow this yet.”

Mah attempted to ease concerns of her Republican colleagues, stating that the bill would merely create an opportunity for someone to receive a parole hearing and would not guarantee anyone will be given a hearing or released from prison.

""It’s not an automatic resentencing or a release,” Mah said. “All these cases come up for review by a judge. The victim’s families are also included in that process.”

Progressive Democrats voiced support for the bill even as many others in their party voted against it or skipped the vote.





""These are people who have spent decades working to be better in the most unimaginable and heinous situations you could dream of, locked behind bars still committed to reforming themselves,” said. Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago.

Mah argued that studies show youth offenders have lower rates of recidivism, and the legislation would give people in prison a reason to rehabilitate themselves.

""This is essentially a way to create fairness in our system that provides incentive for rehabilitation,” Mah said.

Similar legislation has also failed to gain traction in Springfield. A bipartisan bill in the Senate in 2023 stalled after passing committee.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Since 2021, eligible Utah state employees have worked under a “surge remote work” program Utah lawmakers created that year to require working from home, when possible, on poor air quality days. 
But that policy is about to end. A little-known bill that repeals it will take effect May 7. 
Utah lawmakers tucked the repeal into HB404, which mainly clarified who can participate in the state’s pay-for-performance management program, meant to incentivize employees to meet performance goals. As it made its way through the legislative process, public discussion in both chambers focused only on the pay-for-performance provisions of the bill. During their presentation of the legislation on the House and Senate floors, HB404’s sponsors never mentioned the repeal, which appeared in innocuous language near the end of the bill. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Though four Democrats voted against it in the Senate, the bill easily passed both chambers, with no opposition in the House. Gov. Spencer Cox signed it into law March 26. 
Now, state employees are beginning to learn that the program initially pitched as a way for the  state to lead out on proactive air quality efforts will cease to exist in less than four weeks, and just in time for the state’s smog-prone summer months. 
But state officials say they’re moving away from the surge work program because traffic data shows it’s not making a difference. 
Marilee Richins, deputy executive director of the Department of Government Operation, confirmed to Utah News Dispatch on Thursday that eligible state employees will no longer be asked to work from home on bad air days as of May 7. 
She said the recommendation to end the program came after traffic data collected by the Utah Department of Transportation showed no statistical impact on the number of cars on the road during red air days. 
EPA air monitors are disproportionately located in white neighborhoods, research finds

“It was a great idea,” Richins said of the program when it was first conceived, inspired by the drastic reduction of road congestion and improved air quality during COVID-19 shut downs. But ultimately, she said UDOT’s traffic cameras showed the number of vehicles on the roads on surge days were “not statistically impacted at all.” 
“In fact on some surge days, it increased,” she said. 
According to two UDOT “surge day analysis” reports — one with an analysis period in July and August of 2023 and the other conducted during the same period in 2024 — the department’s Traffic Management Division determined “daily variation in traffic volumes makes it difficult to determine the actual impact of surge days.”
“The daily traffic volume fluctuation likely accounts for the differences observed in surge and non-surge days,” the report written in January 2025 said. “Any difference in volumes appears to be statistically insignificant.” 
Richins noted that the state still has an “active teleworking program” that was established in 2018, separate from surge remote work linked to bad air quality days. Of the state’s roughly 22,000 employees, she said 8,890 have jobs that allow them to telework two to three times a week. That’s the same number of employees that are eligible for surge days. 
An additional 3,982 employees telework full time, Richins added, noting that most of these employees live in rural areas off of the Wasatch Front. 
In 2022, Utah had more than 2.25 million licensed drivers, according to the Federal Highway Administration, and ranks as the state with the third-highest rate of car ownership in the country, according to Forbes statistics.

Never intended as an ‘employee benefit’
Though some employees are likely disappointed to see the program end, Richins said it was never intended as an “employee benefit.”
“I know that some employees saw that as a benefit, but it was never put in place as an employee benefit,” she said. “It had nothing to do with that. Surge days was about cleaning the air. And surge days have been shown to not have any impact on cleaning the air.” 
Remote work for state employees in Utah could be changing

Though there was no public discussion during the 2025 Utah Legislature about repealing the program specifically as part of HB404, the governor earlier this year did indicate that he was supportive of reevaluating the state’s teleworking policies. 
“Remote work has its place, but so does being together,” Cox said during a news conference in January. “It’s not healthy to be isolated. We need that feedback, we need that interaction that comes … and being able to get in a room together and be able to talk and look at each other face to face … that matters.” 
Also in January, the Deseret News reported how state leaders — after initially launching a 2018 teleworking pilot program that encouraged telecommuting then fully embracing it after COVID-19 hit — have pulled back on remote work to strike more of a “balance” between remote and in-person work. 
The repeal of the surge remote work program is the latest change in that effort. A spokesperson for Cox did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about his signing of HB404. 
Don’t ditch the program — strengthen it, senator says
Utah faces unique clean air challenges. The Salt Lake Valley’s bowl-shaped geography can exacerbate pollution issues, especially during winter inversions, which can trap cold air in the valley. Summer months can also bring extra pollutants, especially from wildfire smoke.
At times, the Salt Lake area can rank among the top most polluted cities in the nation, and sometimes the world. Last July, Salt Lake City had the 14th worst air quality globally and the worst for a U.S. city, according to IQ Air. 
Motor vehicles — cars and trucks — are the main source of Utah’s air pollution today, causing 55% of winter emissions, according to a 2020 Envision Utah report. Homes and businesses, specifically for heating and wood burning) make up 27% of winter emissions. 
Sen Nate Blouin, D-Salt Lake City, was among the four Democrats that voted against HB404, though most of their arguments against were over changes to the state’s pay-for-performance program. He told Utah News Dispatch on Thursday that at least some Senate Democrats were aware of the repeal of the surge work program tucked into the bill, but they did not publicly debate it on the Senate floor in part due to time limitations. 
Radio diaries: Utahns monitoring their indoor air quality wonder — are their habits worth it?

The bill won final legislative approval on the last night of the 2025 session that ended March 7, with just 13 minutes to spare before lawmakers’ midnight deadline. 
Blouin argued the repeal in HB404 is pointing Utah “in the wrong direction” when it comes to clean air efforts. He said instead of “ditching” the program after looking at traffic data, state officials should have looked to see how they can improve it. 
“Rather than say we’re just not even going to try, let’s make it stronger, let’s try to do something that actually does work,” he said. “And there are many ways we can do that. I’d love to see obviously (more efforts) in the private sector and look for ways to incentivize the majority of our workforce and not just the minority of folks that work for state government.” 
Richins, however, said repealing the program was the “responsible thing to do.” She said state officials took a step back and asked, “is it working?” 
“It’s not,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we don’t care about clean air. We care a lot about clean air. It means that we want to do things to clean up the air that work.” 
But that’s not the only misgiving Blouin had with HB404. He acknowledged it was a little-known bill with repeal language that was easy to miss, and he took issue with putting the end of the surge program in a bill focused on a separate issue. He said that strategy is happening more frequently, leaving Utahns feeling caught off guard by legislation. 
“We shouldn’t have these things just tucked inside (bills),” Blouin said. “That’s part of why people don’t have a whole lot of trust in the Legislature or government as a larger entity right now.” 
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, did not immediately return a request for comment through a House spokesperson Thursday.

The two new cases are not related to the hospitalizations, NMDOH Director of Communications Robert Nott told Source NM.
Reported measles infections have so far been limited to three counties in the Southeast corner: Lea, Eddy and Chaves counties. Of the 58 total cases, the infections break down into: 15 cases in very young children; 16 cases in school-aged children ages 7 to 17; and 27 cases in adults.
In response to questions from Source earlier this week, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state would expand its measles reporting, somewhat in line with what was done with COVID-19, as cases grow.
“We’ll do a rate of infection,” she said, “and start to map that out.”
The governor said the health department also would expand its “whole measles education” outreach “because infants to one-year-olds can’t have the vaccine, which means there’s no protection for them, so we have to really think about exposure where they are.” She said people can expect regular briefings on measles and infectious diseases. “It’s a great place for me to pitch,” she said. “Please get a vaccine. If you haven’t had a measles vaccine, get one. If you think you need a booster, get one. They’re free.”
The governor also noted her concern about the federal government’s recent cancellation of billions of dollars in public health grants alongside massive layoffs. “More than 50% of our budget is based in federal funds,” she said, and “public health is a serious issue.”
Nott previously told Source that the state lost approximately $60 million in federal funds. More recently, he confirmed that the department had canceled some contracts with “community providers that provide outreach to underserved communities relating to vaccination efforts and education.”
The department also lost 37 temporary staff, he said, 20 of whom helped order vaccines and checked vaccination records; four of whom worked in IT; and 13 who were community health workers with the department’s Office of Border Health based in Las Cruces.
Measles cases continue to rise elsewhere in the country, more than double the total cases reported in 2024. Texas health officials reported an additional 36 cases there, bringing the total to 541.
Measles is a highly infectious respiratory disease spread through contact with droplets from infected people’s coughs. These droplets can survive for hours in the air. People can transmit measles days before showing any of the symptoms such as fever, red eyes, cough, headache or the spotty red rash on the face and body.
An estimated one in five cases has serious complications warranting hospitalization, including brain swelling, pneumonia or death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Two doses of a vaccine is the best prevention against measles, according to health officials.
Between Feb. 1 until April 10, more than 17,346 New Mexicans received vaccines, including 9,494 children and 7,852 adults. The latest data from Tuesday, shows that New Mexico’s vaccination rate is more than double the same time frame in 2024.
NMDOH is hosting 10 walk-in clinics for eight Southeastern counties, which you can find on the department’s measles webpage, along with vaccine clinic events across the state.

Laura Kelly, which was half the total overrides supported by the Senate.","Lawrence Democratic Rep. Barbara Ballard, center in red, and Manhattan Democratic Rep. Sydney Carlin, seated left, were among House members who changed their ""no"" vote to ""yes"" on a package of 15 overrides of budget vetoes issued by Gov. Laura Kelly. On Friday, Ballard and Carlin joined four other House members in support of overrides requiring a two-thirds majority vote. The House agreed to override half the budget vetoes sought by the Senate. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Three Republicans and three Democrats in the House dropped their opposition Friday to overriding Gov. Laura Kelly on 15 budget vetoes to meet the Senate halfway toward restoration of spending earmarks on the verge of being deleted from the appropriations bill.
Kelly got the ball rolling by making more than 30 line-item vetoes in Senate Bill 125 — the mega-budget bill that would keep state government running through the next fiscal year and featured a Christmas-tree assortment of expenditures sought by lobbyists and special-interest organizations. The Senate voted to reject all of Kelly’s budget vetoes, while the House pulled together a list of 15 priority vetoes it would consider overriding.
In a stunner Thursday, the GOP-led House rejected the scaled-down package and opened the door to sustaining each of the governor’s budget vetoes.
Rep. Charlette Esau, an Olathe Republican, was among GOP lawmakers who initially voted with Democrats to prevent the House from securing the two-thirds majority necessary to override the governor’s budget vetoes. She returned to the Capitol on Friday convinced she had made a mistake, and offered a motion to reconsider the House’s rejection of the 15-item list.
The House responded by voting 88-34 to accept the override package. The two-thirds majority in the House was reached after six lawmakers flipped their votes. Those changing positions were Democrats Barbara Ballard of Lawrence, Sydney Carlin of Manhattan and KC Ohaebosim of Wichita along with Republicans Brian Bergkamp of Wichita, Steve Huebert of Valley Center and Esau.
Rep. Brandon Woodard, the Democratic leader in the House, said he appreciated the bipartisan coalition that voted 82-42 on Thursday to block the budget overrides. He said he was disappointed advocates and lobbyists were able to convince lawmakers to change their votes.
“I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the overnight decision change to reconsider the motion to override the governor’s budget line-item vetoes,” Woodard said. “It is fiscally irresponsible to bundle these line items together and push them through under pressure from GOP leadership and outside special interests. The voices of Kansans — and the judgment of their elected representatives —should never be overshadowed by external political agendas.”
Rep. Brett Fairchild, a Republican from St. John, refused to change his vote against the 15-piece veto bundle in the House. He said there were individual vetoes that he’d enthusiastically vote to reverse, but he rejected the bundling of veto overrides. Traditionally, the House and Senate voted on vetoes one at a time.
“It sends a message to the governor that we don’t even want her to find waste and fraud in the budgets,” Fairchild said.
 
Show me the money
Esau said she was most concerned about loss of a $1 million earmarked for O’Connell Children’s Shelter in Lawrence, which works with children dealing with trauma and might be a risk to themselves or others. She said funding for the shelter could help children in the foster care system not ready to be placed with a family in a home.
“They (families) don’t have the ability to handle kids that need to be in a specific location getting treatment,” Esau said.
Kelly said she vetoed the appropriation because language in the bill allocating tax dollars to O’Connell created a no-bid contract that circumvented the state’s regular grant review process necessary to ensure “services provided are the bet quality at the best price.”
The reversal of fortune in the House saved a $3 million appropriation to the “pregnancy compassion awareness program” advocated by Kansans for Life and other organizations opposed to abortion. The program, housed in the office of the state treasurer and previously referred to as the “pregnancy crisis” program, was authorized as an alternative to traditional health clinics or family-planning centers. The governor’s veto message said she viewed the Legislature’s decision to place the program in the office of the state treasurer as “inappropriate and simply politically motivated.”
“There is no guarantee this funding is going to be directed to expenditures for moms and babies. It more or less has no strings attached,” said Rep. Jo Ella Hoye, D-Lenexa.
The Legislature’s work on veto overrides preserved bonding authority for construction of a $130 million veterinary diagnostic laboratory on the campus of Kansas State University. It restored $500,000 for unmanned aircraft research at Wichita State University and $500,000 for aviation research at the Salina campus of Kansas State.
The package retained a mandate championed by Sen. Virgil Peck, R-Havana, to assess a monthly rental fee of $1 per square foot for office space used by journalists in the Capitol. The Kansas Reflector wasn’t assigned office space at the statehouse, but rents private office space in Topeka. Kelly had vetoed the rental fee and recommended the Legislature “look for ways to make the lawmaking process more transparent.”
 
‘Highly inefficient’
The Legislature overrode Kelly’s veto of a provision that forbid the Kansas Lottery from negotiating on contract renewals with casinos operating sports gambling in Kansas. Veto action of legislators allocated $1.5 million to a new program in the state treasurer’s office to attract talented workers to the state. The maneuver defunded a comparable Kansas Department of Commerce program known as “Love, Kansas,” touted by Lt. Gov. David Toland.
“It is highly inefficient to create a new, unvetted program with no guardrails in an agency that has nothing to do with workforce development or talent attraction,” Kelly said.
In addition, the override included a requirement the Kansas Arts Commission dedicate 60% of grants to counties with a population of less than 85,000 people.
Work of the Legislature retained a double-appropriation to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment of $250,000 and $96,000 for prevention of tuberculosis. Lawmakers held onto allocation of $263,000 to various Kansas health facilities for cerebral palsy research. Also, the votes reversed Kelly’s veto of $375,000 for interpreter services for individuals who were deaf or had hearing challenges.
The voting resulted in preservation of a provision that directed the Kansas Highway Patrol to collaborate with a third-party entity to build an aviation hangar in Wichita that would be leased to KHP. Originally, KPH requested funding to buy a hangar. Kelly said she vetoed it because a lease would cost the state more in the long run.
Voting by the House and Senate kept in place an estimated $2 million that would be spent to purchase software that would diagram school buildings in preparation for emergency calls to law enforcement officers. The governor said she vetoed the expenditure because the state’s 911 agency didn’t request the funding and reported that it didn’t have the personnel capacity to enact the program.
Rep. John Carmichael, a Wichita Democrat who serves on the Kansas 911 Coordinating Council, said the earmark was the result of a lobbyist working to please clients that marketed the mapping software. He said the state was engaged in a pilot project to examine possible use of mapping technology, but that assessment wasn’t completed.
“If you want to know how taxpayer money gets wasted and how budgets get inflated, here’s a prime example,” Carmichael said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC022394-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-11 15:06:58.462217

(Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.












They're incentivized to cut corners.

Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators earlier this year considered a similar bill that would have prohibited state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would have required that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House but did not get through the Senate before the session ended.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
 Private detention oversight

Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
 Troubling conditions

Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

Beverly Gossage spoke this week about the importance of creating a new department, the Kansas Early Childhood Office, to get all child-care governance under one umbrella. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The House and Senate moved forward this week to create a new Kansas Office of Early Childhood, merging three departments that govern child care in the state, while loosening regulations for child care providers and providing an opt-out for required child vaccinations.
Both chambers passed House Bill 2045, sending the legislation on to Gov. Laura Kelly for her approval. The votes came over objections from several lawmakers about the lack of a fiscal note and opportunity to debate.
Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Eudora Republican, said the bill was the result of three years’ worth of work to put governance of private child care under one umbrella.
“We had licensing under the Department of Education, we had funding under DCF, we had the Children’s Cabinet,” she said. “So the idea was to create the Office of Early Childhood and have a director in that office, overseeing three subdivisions.”
The bill also looks at child care regulations, making changes to allow fewer education requirements for some workers in a child care facility and changing ratios of the number of adults to children, Gossage said.
The bill also changes vaccination requirements, allowing a child’s guardian to avoid the immunization requirements if they provide a signed written statement that immunizations violate sincerely held religious beliefs.
Several legislators raised concerns that such a significant change as adding a new department was coming before the Legislature in a conference committee report, which is negotiated by representatives from both the House and Senate and can’t be amended by either chamber. Sen. Doug Shane, a Louisburg Republican, said he thinks the 63-page bill should be debated in front of the Senate.
“I really appreciate and agree with a lot of changes that are brought forth in the bill, including trying to decouple child care from burdensome regulations, but I’m concerned without thoroughly vetting this and with the creation of a new agency that we set ourselves up for long-term challenges,” he said. “Echoing the famous words of Ronald Reagan,  it feels a little bit like we’re from the government and we’re here to help, which is probably what created our child care crisis to begin with.”
In the House, Rep. Barb Wasinger, a Hays Republican, raised concerns about the bill’s fiscal note, or lack thereof.
“It starts a whole new agency, which means more full-time employees, which means more money to the Children’s Cabinet. It means starting a whole new preschool area involved with child care in the school district,” she said. “I think this is a good bill with some bad changes.”
Rep. Susan Ruiz, D-Shawnee, assured the House that consolidating departments under the new banner of an Early Childhood Office doesn’t necessarily mean new costs, but some representatives remained unconvinced.
“I just cannot support something where we don’t know how it is going to affect us financially,” said Rep. Carrie Barth, R-Baldwin City.
Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, argued that the changes to child care regulations are much needed.
“I had a lot of the same concerns that you all do, but over time we worked through it and we think this is a good bill,” he said. “It’s going to open up thousands of slots for day care. One of the No. 1 reasons people are not in the workforce is because they can’t find day care for their children. This goes a long way in solving that problem.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa State University has been awarded more than $2 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to carry out six research projects that will help prevent and combat animal disease outbreaks. 
The Iowa awards were part of an announcement from the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, of $15.3 million for research that enhances preparedness, detection and response to “the most damaging diseases that threaten U.S. livestock.” 
Molly Lee, the associate director of ISU’s Center for Food Security and Public Health, said the projects will generate free resources for producers and animal health professionals. 
“Animal disease preparedness is a valuable investment that strengthens our food supply, ensures farmers’ livelihoods and protects public health,” Lee said in a statement. “Supporting animal agriculture with grants like these is a critical and efficient use of federal resources.”
Some of the projects build on general biosecurity protocol, like “Disinfection 201” which received $315,000 to further develop an existing online module with disinfection guidance for different species and diseases. The “just-in-time” project was awarded $447,000 to develop an on-demand library of information to expedite an outbreak response, and another would make general biosecurity protocol trainings more relevant to small and niche producers. 
Enhanced biosecurity has been a common phrase over the past several months as the highly pathogenic avian influenza continues to impact millions of birds and dairy cattle nationwide. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins recently announced $100 million to fund research around treatment, biosecurity and prevention of the bird flu. That funding, which is open for applications until May 19, is separate from the APHIS National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program, through which the ISU research was awarded.
Another ISU project was awarded $284,000 to develop training materials and workshops for preparedness against the Japanese encephalitis virus, which can infect humans and most domesticated animals, including swine. The virus is mostly present in Asia and has not been detected in the U.S.
The final two funded projects at ISU would increase biosecurity measures for horses and research around foreign animal diseases that could affect the aquatic animal industry.
The funding is part of the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program which was authorized by the 2018 Farm Bill.

Breadwinner: Committee advances proposal to make tortilla NM’s ‘state bread’

“I am vetoing this legislation to send a clear message,” she wrote, “in a time of extraordinary challenges New Mexicans need discipline and urgency from their elected officials. What they received this session was far too often the opposite.”
Hundreds of bills, the governor continued, “never saw the light of day” due to time constraints or because lawmakers did not give the bills hearings. “Some, like legislation to regulate synthetic cannabinoids and keep dangerous substances out of the hands of children, died while waiting for concurrence—a process that can take less than a minute.”
Moreover, she noted, in the final hours of the session and in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Las Cruces “that went unacknowledged by House leadership, the House found time to debate the merits of a state bread. And the Legislature found time to pass not one, not two, but three separate license plate bills—despite already having 40 specialty plates on the books.”
The governor continued by saying that while she too enjoys “celebrating our unique culture,” New Mexico already has a plethora of state symbols (cookies, songs, vegetables etc.) “The question should not be how many more symbols we can collect—but whether we are meeting the moment with the gravity it demands. We are living in perilous and unprecedented times. The stakes for our State have never been higher. We need a Legislature that rises to the occasion and focuses on the work that truly matters to the people of New Mexico.”
In total, the governor vetoed the following 16 bills:
House Bill 143: Lobbying Activity Reports 
This bill would have required lobbyists to file reports explaining what bills they had been retained to work on and what positions they hold on said bills. For instance, as Source previously reported, it remains unclear to this day why the Texas-based Cicero Institute and its advocacy arm Cicero Action decided to have a lobbying presence in the state during this last session. In her veto message, the governor wrote that she supported the bill’s intent, but it needed work. For instance, she continued: “It imposes an onerous requirement that lobbyists or their employers file these reports within forty–eight hours of commencing the lobbying activity— including any time their ‘position on legislation has changed’— irrespective of weekends and holidays. It is also unclear how this requirement applies to lobbying activity that commences on legislation after the adjournment of a legislative session since another subsection of HB 143 simply provides that these reports merely need to be filed ‘prior to the end of the time period in which the governor may act on legislation.” Moreover, she wrote, the bill does not make it clear what constitutes a “change in position” for lobbyists. Lastly, she added, “I think it is important that elected officials with a donor base such as legislators (and governors) also be required to disclose their changes in position. I look forward to working with the Legislature in the next session on a bill that really adds transparency and accountability.”
60 days later, Cicero Institute’s reason for NM lobbying still hidden from public

House Bill 14: Earned Income Tax Credit (Tax Package) 
Legislative watchers may recall a fair amount of last-minute wrangling over the tax package, which ultimately included a slight tax on alcohol sales, among tax credit expansions in fiscal year 2027 paid out of state reserves. The governor vetoed the entire package, writing “New Mexicans deserve thoughtful, forward-looking policy-not last-minute dealmaking that delays relief, ignores economic opportunity, and undermines fiscal responsibility.” 
House Bill 36: Board of Optometry Powers and Duties,
The bill would have allowed optometrists to perform several procedures that currently can only be performed by ophthalmologists. “I am vetoing this bill because it sets a dangerous precedent for allowing non-surgeons to perform surgical procedures,” the governor wrote.

House Bill 77: Annual Federal SNAP State Outreach Plans
The bill would have required the Health Care Authority to develop annual outreach plans to promote the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which the governor wrote is “unnecessary because the HCA already does extensive outreach promoting SNAP.”
House Bill 120: Accessibility of State Agencies
This legislation would have required state agencies to develop their websites to meet federal disability standards, and created a state office to enforce the digital standards. Lujan Grisham said in her veto message the bill duplicates an effort her office started and, “enacting it into law will only disrupt the process that my Administration has already established to ensure accessibility.”
House Bill 181: State Trust Program Accountability Plan
The bill would have amended the Accountability in Government Act. The governor said she vetoed the bill because “it does not achieve its stated goal of increasing transparency and accountability in the use of GRO Trust funds.”
House Bill 191: Wildfire Suppression & Preparedness Funds
This legislation would have created two wildfire-related permanent funds administered by the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD): the post wildfire fund and the wildfire suppression fund, with a $12 million appropriation attached to the first fund.
“The wildfire suppression fund is a good idea on its face,” the governor wrote in her veto message.. “However, the Legislature did not provide any money for it, instead requiring all federal reimbursements for wildfire suppression costs or out–of–state assignments for state crews to be deposited into the fund. Given the snail’s pace of federal reimbursements–which have only gotten slower in recent months–relying on that funding stream does not set this program up for success. I will, however, require the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department’s Forestry Division and the State Fire Marshal’s Office to collaborate on outreach to the public to educate homeowners on effective means to minimize the risk to private property from wildfires.” As for the $12 million appropriation, she wrote, “put simply, that is not nearly enough money to even put a dent in post fire recovery operations.”
House Bill 219: Slot Canyon Riverlands State Park
This bill would have created a new state park in Southern New Mexico. The governor said she vetoed the bill due to existing state parks already being understaffed and undermaintained. “Adding another state park will only spread stretched resources even further,” she wrote.
Proposal to designate a Southern NM hidden hiking gem into a state park heads to the Senate floor

House Bill 269: Health Care Authority Visit Verification
The governor wrote this bill is unnecessary as the HCA is already working on creating the type of system prescribed in the legislation, and with completing anticipated in October.
House Bill 433: Study Career & Tech Education
Also unnecessary, the governor said in her veto
House Bill 494: Tax Exemptions for Veterans
This bill “purported to enable veterans to claim a property tax exemption,” the governor wrote in her veto. “However, HB 494 actually makes it harder for veterans to obtain this important benefit by changing the current one–year window to apply to a mere 30 days. At bottom, this bill benefits county assessors more than veterans.”
Senate Bill 142: Grid Modernization Roadmap
Lujan Grisham said this bill duplicated efforts already in motion at the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department.  
Senate Bill 220: Publication Of Legal Settlement Terms 
The bill would have required the state’s insurance arm the Risk Management Division and the public school insurance authority to post settlement data from alleged misconduct to the state’s Sunshine Portal. Risk Management Division has been voluntarily posting the information since 2019, but SB220 would have added an additional layer of review in cases resulting in deaths, serious injury or losses over $250,000, and required reports to the legislature. 
Lujan Grisham wrote the bill was unclear in the standards for the review, and that the Legislature “failed to appropriate any funds support this significant workload increase, nor did the Legislature account for the resources needed to ensure a fair, thorough, and timely process.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents approved multiple bylaw changes Friday in response to President Donald Trump with some opposition from students, faculty and two elected regents.
In two 6-2 votes, the NU Board of Regents amended various policies, including those on “equal opportunity” in employment, admission of students and cultural diversity in setting nonresident tuition remission programs. NU’s four student regents did not support the changes, though their votes are non-binding under the Nebraska Constitution.
The changes came after the Trump administration in February warned colleges and universities that federal funding could be at risk if they didn’t end diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

NU Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, who opposed the changes along with Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha, said the decision “weighed heavily” on her after an emergency Feb. 25 meeting, less than two weeks after the Trump letter, to let the bylaw changes to come up for a vote in time.
O’Connor said the federal action against DEI didn’t specifically define the targeted programs. She noted DEI isn’t just race or ethnicity but is also about women, first-generation college students, nontraditional students, veterans, low-income students and students with disabilities.
“The practices targeted are often research-based practices with decades of education research that indicates numerous benefits to individuals, community and society,” O’Connor said. 
Students speak out
Student Regents Elizabeth Herbin (University of Nebraska-Lincoln), Ishani Adidam (University of Nebraska at Omaha) and Pranita Devaraju (University of Nebraska Medical Center) said they publicly opposed the changes on behalf of their student bodies.
Herbin and Adidam have spoken out on past actions on their campuses to shut down DEI-related offices. Zackary Bursh, a 19-year-old sophomore at UNL, said the regents had a choice to decide how to respond and show they care.

Teresa Ibach, Chancellor Joanne Li (UNO), interim Chancellor H. Dele Davies (UNMC) and interim Chancellor Charlie Bicak (UNK). April 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
UNL faculty Stephanie Bondi and Crystal Garcia, who said they study higher education and the proposed changes on students, told the regents Friday that amending the bylaws could hurt students. Garcia said the Trump “anti-civil rights guidance” wasn’t law and that other universities that have complied in response to similar threats have still lost federal funding.
“Complying with this administration will not save us,” Garcia said. “It will only open our campus communities to years of continued scrutiny, surveillance and coercion.”
Adidam, whose UNO campus hosted the regents Friday, said there has been a “culture shift” since the closure of DEI offices. She and Herbin said the policies were more than “language.”
“Yes, this is language, but language is the first step to creating more action that could potentially have negative consequences for students,” Adidam said. “I personally don’t think UNO students would want that.”
The fourth student, Sam Schroeder (University of Nebraska at Kearney), abstained from one of the votes but opposed the second. He will return as UNK’s student regent next year, while this is the last scheduled meeting for the three other student regents.
Regent reactions
Regent Jim Scher of Norfolk said he didn’t necessarily disagree with the students or O’Connor but that he was concerned about the “extent of damage” that inaction could cause.
“I don’t want to cause a financial problem that is much greater than the verbiage problem that we’re talking about,” Scheer said.

Noting the groundswell for underrepresented students that the students and O’Connor defended, Scheer said it could be the same students who lose Pell Grants or federal funding.
“The same students that we’re talking about being recognized and feeling inclusive or important and helpful, without those Pell Grants, wouldn’t be here,” Scheer said. “I’m not going to be cavalier enough to say I’m going to take a stand symbolically because when those people, those students, don’t get their Pell Grants and their funding, they’re no longer students.”
He continued: “I think the education of those students outweighs the value of this symbolic vote to withstand the pressures put on us.”
Regent Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City echoed Scheer that her “overarching responsibility” was to ensure NU could continue to offer educational opportunities.
O’Connor said she recognized those arguments but disagreed with Scheer that she was being “cavalier.” She said that seemed “rude.” Scheer said he was only talking about himself.
“Reasonable minds can have different votes here,” O’Connor said in response.

Devaraju said she understands concerns that without the changes NU could lose funding but said she wanted to use even her “symbolic” vote to speak out.
She added that the “intentionally unclear guidance” came after NU had made many DEI-related changes to appease the federal government and seemed to be leaning toward potential “over compliance.”
“I also feel that in 50 years we will look back and wonder why we didn’t protest at all as our hand was being forced,” Devaraju said.
O’Connor said she worried Friday’s action wouldn’t be the end.
“While today is just one piece of unraveling support for students in research supported by DEI,” O’Connor said, “I believe that it is just the beginning, and it will be hard to reverse the damage done in the future.”
Regents on Friday also approved:

Establishing the Nebraska Children’s Justice and Legal Advocacy Center in the Nebraska College of Law on UNL’s campus.
Creating a graduate certificate for emergency nurse practitioners at UNMC.
Approving collective bargaining agreements for unionized employees at UNK and UNO.
Naming the volleyball court in the Bob Devaney Sports Center the “John Cook Arena” and putting up a bronze statue of the former Huskers volleyball head coach outside.

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)The state of Iowa has revised a restaurant inspection report on a popular Sac County eatery due to issues with the report’s accuracy.
The original Feb. 14, 2025, inspection report for Fat Guy’s Pub & Grub in Auburn resulted in citations for 16 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. That report has since been revised to show citations for 14 risk-factor violations, and the original report has been replaced with a new, “corrected” version on the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
The department says that while its inspector originally reported seeing “discharge coming from the line cook’s nose,” such violations must be based on “persistent sneezing, coughing, or a runny nose,” and the occurrence at Fat Guy’s was an “isolated instance and it was not persistent.” The inspector had intended to remove that violation before the report was published, but mistakenly failed to do so, according to the department.
Also, the original report identified raw beef, pork and chicken being stored over fruit, risking cross-contamination. DIAL says that while beef was stored directly over the fruit, pork and chicken were not, and so those items have been removed from the report.
In addition, the restaurant was also cited for a lack of date-markings on food items to ensure their freshness and safety, with the inspector originally reporting there were “no date-markings observed on any food prepared on site.” DIAL has since removed that violation, noting that all of the foods that lacked date-markings had reportedly been prepared that morning for use by the end of the day, exempting them from the date-marking requirement.
During a March 28 “physical re-check” of the establishment, no violations were cited.
Restaurant owner Colin King told the Iowa Capital Dispatch on April 11 that he had to contact his state representative and then meet with DIAL’s Food Safety Bureau Chief Mark Speltz, along with a representative of the Iowa Restaurant Association, to have his concerns addressed.
“This has really, really hurt my business,” he said, adding that the DIAL inspector appeared to be inexperienced, broke glassware during his February visit, and later acknowledged he had made mistakes during the inspection.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dia-inspections.jpg,,,2025-04-11 15:06:58.462217

(File photo provided by BWM)President Donald Trump’s fluctuating tariff policies could hit South Carolina’s multibillion-dollar auto industry particularly hard — both coming and going.
Unlike the big Detroit-based automakers that build more cars and trucks for the U.S. market, automotive manufacturers with facilities in the Palmetto State mostly sell their vehicles overseas. For that reason, these companies could face a double-whammy on prices if Trump administration tariffs go into effect as announced, according to economists.

 Top export destinations for SC made cars

Germany — $3.9 billion
S. Korea — $1.3 billion
Belgium — $1 billion
China — $941 million
Canada — $737 million
U.K. — $684 million
Australia — $491 million
Mexico — $229 million

The first hit, which impacts all United States auto production, could come from tariffs — taxes paid by the importing company or buyer to the government that issued them, in this case the U.S. — on the car parts shipped in to build vehicles. 
The second, for manufacturers that export cars, could come if other countries respond with tariffs of their own on the finished vehicles sent out on container ships from the Port of Charleston. Sales of South Carolina-made vehicles could ultimately sink if those retaliatory tariffs lead to sticker shock for buyers overseas.
“They’re seeing increased cost on the production side, as well as lower demand from their consumer base, so it can hurt them in both ways,” said Joey Von Nessen, an economist at the University of South Carolina who has studied the state’s auto industry.
If used as a short-term measure to negotiate better deals with trade partners, as some in Trump’s sphere have hinted, the impacts on vehicle production are likely to be minimal. But if enacted and kept in place long term, the policy ultimately will lead to increased prices for U.S. consumers regardless of the outcome, Von Nessen added.
 Where things stand

To date, the Trump administration has enacted a 25% tax paid by importers of foreign steel, aluminum and vehicles, as well as a flat 10% tax on imports from all other countries. For China, the administration has doubled down, enacting a 125% tax on all imports from the Asian country. 
The president has argued tariffs will help the economy by driving more manufacturing back to the U.S. 
“What will happen with tariffs over time — the ultimate goal of the tariffs, and the president says it all the time: Bring your factory here,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News last week after the first round of tariffs on foreign-made automobiles kicked in.
Hedge fund chief and tariff fan Scott Bessent to lead Treasury under Trump

Bessent, a South Carolina native, has long been in favor of tariffs, arguing they’re a way for the government to raise tax revenue in the short term and protect and build more domestic industry in the long run.
“I think President Trump is right,” Gov. Henry McMaster also told reporters this week. “I think his goal is to make the United States independent and self-sufficient, so that we do not have to depend on countries who might not be our friend. That goal is a worthy one and should have been done a long time ago.”
In response, Canadian officials have retaliated with 25% tariffs on certain U.S. goods, including fruits and vegetables, appliances, liquor, steel, aluminum and vehicles. China, too, matched the U.S. with retaliatory tariffs.
And while the European Union has held out in hope of negotiating, the 27-country bloc readied its own retaliatory tariffs in the event that those trade talks fall through.
More to come
An ensuing global trade war is of particular concern to South Carolina’s export-focused auto industry.
BMW’s plant in Spartanburg has exported more than 2.7 million vehicles in the past decade – about 63% of total production from the Upstate facility, according to the German automaker. And more than half of Volvos made in Ridgeville are sent overseas, the Swedish auto company has said.

 Where SC automakers get car parts

Mexico — $2.9 billion
Germany — $2 billion
Austria — $768 million
China — $607 million
U.K. — $543 million
Canada — $287 million
Czech Republic — $287 million
Poland — $248 million

But still to come are 25% tariffs on foreign-made auto parts that go into U.S.-assembled vehicles. These taxes, expected to take effect May 3, will hit even automakers building in the U.S. because the supply chain for these companies is so globally interconnected.
The cost of vehicles made and sold in the U.S. could rise by an estimated $3,000 to $7,000 as a result, said Scott Baier, an economist at Clemson University who previously served on the President’s Council of Economic Advisors under President George W. Bush and has consulted for the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. International Trade Commission.
In 2024, South Carolina imported billions of dollars’ worth of car parts, largely from Germany and Mexico.
“We stress that the concept of a U.S. car maker with parts all from the U.S. is a fictional tale that does not exist and would take years to make this concept a reality,” Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors last week.
And Daniel Roeska, an analyst at the financial management firm Bernstein, told investors that while the vehicle tariff is damaging, the parts tariffs “could break the system,” pushing suppliers already operating on thin margins to bankruptcy.
Furthermore, Baier said, the impacts could expand in ways tariff writers hadn’t imagined. Auto insurance, for example, could rise as the cost to repair or replace vehicles goes up in the case of an accident.
How SC automakers measure up

The first Scout Motors vehicle is not expected to roll off the manufacturing line in Blythewood until late 2027, giving the Volkswagen subsidiary time to adjust to possible tariffs.
CEO Scott Keogh told reporters Thursday he anticipates 50% of Scout’s supply base will be within 200 miles of the factory once construction of the facility is complete.
“Are we 100% everything localized in the United States as of right now? Absolutely not,” Keogh said. “But are these decisions that we can make, are these dials that we can turn? We can. So I think Scout’s position is good because it was designed for this moment.”
Unlike other South Carolina automakers, Scout is building its cars to largely be sold in the U.S.
All other vehicles assembled in South Carolina are made up of 32% or less U.S. and Canadian made parts, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The X3, the second most popular BMW model sold in the U.S., is just 9% U.S. and Canadian made. And while the agency doesn’t break down its data further, the Canadian portion of those parts would be subject to tariffs under Trump’s proposal.
The largest parts of the cars, the engines and transmissions, are brought in from Germany, Austria, the U.K. and Sweden. Volvo also relies heavily on Mexico and China.
Scout Motors wants to sell vehicles direct to SC customers. A clash with dealers has efforts on ice.

White House Trade Advisor Peter Navarro even called out the Spartanburg plant by name on CNBC Monday saying: “This business model where BMW and Mercedes come in to … South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions. That doesn’t work for America. It’s bad for our economics. It’s bad for our national security. We want them to come here.”
BMW snapped back, defending its record and highlighting the more than 11,000 people it employs, the 1,500 vehicles those workers assemble daily and the $14.8 billion it has invested in its Upstate plant over the past three decades.
South Carolina also boasts auto suppliers, lured to the state by BMW’s presence, that make everything from tires and powertrain components to seats, mirrors, exhaust systems and brake parts.
“It is impossible to overstate the profoundly positive impact of the automotive industry on our great state — from our economy to our people and our communities,” said Sara Hazzard, president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance. “Thousands of families depend on the jobs generated by this billion-dollar industry, which has transformed our state in the eyes of the world for over half of a century.”

For its part, BMW has continued to urge negotiations between the U.S. and E.U.
“Free trade and international cooperation are of immense importance worldwide, serving as key drivers of growth and progress,” spokeswoman Nathalie Bauters said in a statement. “Both sides should quickly reach a transatlantic agreement that fosters growth. This would also benefit consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”
U.S. announcements
Still, if tariffs stay in place, there are some early indicators that some automakers might be willing to move factories to get a piece of the U.S. market. Hyundai, for example, has pledged to build a new steel plant in Louisiana. And Honda has named Indiana for production of its hybrid Civic.
SC readying training for EV workers across the state. Here’s what job seekers can expect.

“The American market is so large; we’re one of the biggest markets in the world,” Von Nessen said. “And, so, manufacturers and companies do want access to the American customer base.”
And in South Carolina, Volvo has talked about increasing production levels.
Former CEO Hakan Samuelsson unexpectedly returned to the helm last week as Volvo’s stock prices have struggled in recent months. At the company’s annual meeting in Gothenburg, he told investors Volvo has extra space at its plant in Ridgeville — space that could be used to produce a model that will sell better in the U.S. than the current all-electric EX90.
“I think the next car should be some car with a high volume in the U.S. … I don’t know exactly what that car would be,” he told Reuters.
But Von Nessen cautioned that these are just announcements. Actual investment has yet to take place.
“The bottom line is that the costs of tariffs are typically immediate,” he said. “The benefits, if they appear and to the extent they appear, can take a much longer time to be realized.”
Even if we do see investments in the U.S., he said, it’ll still mean higher prices for consumers, as the cost of those new auto and parts manufacturing facilities get baked into the cars’ price tags.
Due to the rapid-fire pace of these tariff announcements, Von Nessen doesn’t expect companies to make manufacturing choices any time soon.

“We have this period of uncertainty, and they are essentially holding off on investment decisions until they have a clear understanding of what their cost structure is going to look like,” he said.
This uncertainty could also start showing up in U.S. jobs numbers, Baier said.
“From the perspective of a hiring manager, in any industry, it’s hard to forecast demand,” he said. “They may not let anybody go, but they’re certainly not going to bring anyone on.”
 ‘Nothing we’ve ever seen before’

So far, the Trump administration has backed away from its most controversial tariff proposal, pausing sweeping tax increases on goods from more than 75 countries he said were willing to negotiate new trade deals. On Wednesday, he suspended for 90 days the tariffs he unveiled a week earlier, with the huge exception of China, and the stock market soared.
Bessent, the treasury secretary, claimed the abrupt turnaround was Trump’s “strategy all along” to create maximum leverage.
But for a week, the announced tariffs roiled the stock market and baffled economists.
Markets revive after Trump sets 90-day pause on many tariffs, hikes China to 125%

“These are big taxes,” Baier said. “This is so widespread and the numbers are so high, it’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”
And South Carolina, as a port state with a large number of international companies, may be more tied globally to the effects of a downturn, according to the state’s revenue forecasters.
“Whatever is happening with a global economy is going to be affecting, to a bigger degree, the economy of South Carolina than many other states,” staff economist Karl Vesely told members of the state’s Board of Economic Advisors on Thursday.
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell called the expansive new tariffs and their possible economic impact “significantly larger than expected.” But Powell also indicated the Fed would “wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments” to interest rates as it keeps a close watch on inflation.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs sounded the alarm on a possible recession only to pull back slightly after the president’s reversal. But the rollback offered no reprieve for the auto sector and left many still wondering what will happen in 90 days.
Economists from Wall Street firms such as Capital Economics and Moody’s predict consumers will start to see noticeably higher prices by summer if the current tariffs remain in place or are raised.
“The loss in purchasing power that consumers have experienced over the last several years, that’s the key for thinking about the likelihood of a recession this year,” Von Nessen said. “Consumers are still worse off today, from a purchasing power perspective, than they were on the eve of the pandemic in 2019.”
Prices in the U.S. over that time period have gone up by 25%, while wages have risen by about 20%.
“The concern is that tariffs could reignite inflation and basically keep that gap from from closing,” Von Nessen said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/24FRP0079crop2-1024x489.jpg,,,2025-04-11 15:06:58.462217

The Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) will host its 27th Annual Breast Cancer Update virtually on May 14, featuring a presentation highlighting the troubling distinction as the state with the highest rates of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) among Black women. 
As part of DBCC’s ongoing efforts to raise awareness of this disproportionate health crisis, the virtual update, titled “Breast Cancer: The State We’re In,” is a free educational event open to the public. 
The conference will feature a keynote presentation by Dr. Scott Siegel, who will discuss Delaware’s alarming distinction as the state with the highest rates of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) among Black women. This is part of an ongoing effort by DBCC to raise awareness of the disproportionately high incidence of TNBC in the state.
“Triple Negative Breast Cancer is the most aggressive form of breast cancer, and it is unfortunately more prevalent among Black women,” Dr. Siegel explained.
The presentation will highlight reasons behind the prevalence of TNBC in Delaware and provide insights into ongoing population health research. The DBCC campaign, titled “1st is the worst,” highlights Delaware’s troubling position at the forefront of this issue, underscoring the urgency for action.
TNBC, which can be more challenging to treat than other types of breast cancer, affects people of all races but is notably more frequent among Black women. Early detection plays a critical role in improving outcomes for those diagnosed with the disease.
“With the large number of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cases in Delaware, I think the sessions on TNBC and genetics are very relevant to us all currently,” said Connie Holdridge, DBCC’s Survivorship Specialist.

The update will feature a range of informative sessions. Topics include genetic testing, breast cancer screening recommendations, and nutrition and survivorship. Participants will also be treated to a live cooking demonstration to promote healthy eating habits.
“As a moderator of the nutrition segment, I’m excited to share how we can protect ourselves by practicing healthy eating. Chef Dee is an exciting and thoughtful chef, dietitian, and breast cancer survivor,” said Holdridge.

Lauren Balcerak, Development Manager at DBCC, highlights that their mission is to empower the community through breast health education, which has been shown to increase regular screenings and support early detection.
“Having offered this crucial educational event free for over 26 years through community support, we at DBCC anticipate welcoming hundreds of participants, including survivors, caregivers, medical providers, students, and the public,” Balcerak said.  “To ensure DBCC continues to serve the breast cancer community, your ongoing support is essential.” 
Participants are encouraged to register for the event, which is free of charge, at https://give.debreastcancer.org/ge/bcu2025. 
The DBCC is also seeking sponsors for the event, providing an opportunity for brands to showcase their commitment to breast cancer education and support among a targeted audience.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DBCC-Dr.-Scott-Siegel.png,,,2025-04-11 15:06:58.462217

Todd Bingham, most recently president and CEO of the 120-year-old Utah Manufacturers Association, is to assume the post in mid-May. He was selected by a search committee that included state chamber board members and business leaders.

Bingham will replace Bryan Slone, who earlier had announced his departure from the chamber following seven years in that position. Slone said he planned to pursue other possibilities in Nebraska, including a possible political bid, though he didn’t provide details.
Slone, in a statement, said he was pleased about Bingham’s appointment. He said Bingham’s connections across the country and experience in urban and rural business development make him a great choice to continue the chamber’s work.
Joel Russell, chamber chair, said: “Todd is a wonderful addition to the Nebraska Chamber, bringing backgrounds in public policy and manufacturing, two of the chamber’s largest endeavors.”
Bingham comes with 30 years of experience as a registered lobbyist. He has been an advocate for business and industry, specializing in governmental and regulatory affairs.
According to a chamber news statement, Bingham has served as national chair of the Council of State Manufacturing Associations and is a current board member of the National Association of Manufacturers.
He has served on various state boards and councils, including the Utah Employers Council and an OSHA advisory board, and has contributed to such groups as the Utah Labor Commission’s Workers’ Compensation Advisory Council.

Ned Lamont has proposed ending free prison e-messaging, which would put online communication costs back onto incarcerated individuals and their loved ones.","During the four years Deandre Brown was incarcerated in Connecticut, he was relocated several times to different correctional facilities. The 26-year-old said an electronic messaging program and tablet devices, provided for free by the state, allowed him to maintain steady contact with his wife and mother.
The ability to communicate closely with family is one of the “basic things inmates need for their mental health” he said.

But the system that kept Brown grounded, which has been available for free to incarcerated people in Connecticut prisons since 2022, is facing the threat of budget cuts. Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposed biennial budget seeks to cut state funding for the e-messaging program, putting the cost for online communication back onto individuals like Brown and their loved ones.
“They want to turn off the inmate messaging … If anything it needs to be strengthened,” Brown said.

The governor’s office said that the messaging system has become overly expensive, adding that while it’s important for families of incarcerated people to be able to communicate regularly, the program is difficult to maintain given other demands on the state’s limited finances. 
Phone calls would remain free of charge under the governor’s proposal.
“This text messaging system has a considerable cost, and other communication systems are more affordable,” said Rob Blanchard, director of communications for the governor.
The population in Connecticut’s correctional facilities has increased by over 2,000 in the past four years, from 9,111 people in early 2020 to 11,371 people at the end of 2024.
The savings from canceling e-messaging services would amount to $3.5 million, a small portion of the governor’s proposed $55 billion budget for the next two years.

The governor’s proposal was swiftly met with opposition, from lawmakers and corrections officials as well as advocates and families. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, who co-chairs the legislature’s Judiciary Committee, supported the effort in 2021 that established free communications services — including phone calls and e-messaging — in Connecticut correctional facilities. The legislation passed with strong support in both chambers in May 2021, making Connecticut one of the first states in the country to take this step. 
Winfield said the proposal in this year’s budget to cut out free online messaging would effectively be going back on a promise made to the state’s most vulnerable. “I don’t know why the administration are doing this,” Winfield said. “Given that the communications program was put in place in 2021, I am disappointed. They feel like walk backs.”
Jovaan Lumpkin carried out a 14-year suspended sentence at multiple correctional facilities in the state between 2005 and 2019. He said that during this time communication with people close to him “was essential” — calls from Lumpkin’s mother kept him connected to his family and helped him stay present in his little sister’s life as she grew up. Had it all been free, that would have lessened stress on his family, he said.
“We talked about everything. She would keep me updated on my family,” he said. 
Lumpkin finished his sentence before free communications came into effect, but he said he sees how clearly the program could improve the mental wellbeing of people in prison and set them up for fuller lives after release.
Lumpkin’s mother, Diane Lewis, said she remembered paying high rates to speak with her son during the eight years he was in the corrections system. “When they run out of calls for the day, then messaging becomes crucial for keeping families together,” she said. 
“People want to get their normal lives back before they were imprisoned,” Lewis said. The phone calls “pushed him to be with his family. Through messaging, he realized what family really meant,” she said.
“I did not want a stranger to come home to me,” Lewis said.

Lewis is now an advocate for prison reform. She expressed relief that since her son’s release, free phone calls and electronic messaging have helped thousands of people.
Other lawmakers, including Judiciary Committee members Rep. Craig Fishbein, R- Wallingford, and Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, said given the state’s budget constraints, eliminating the free messaging service makes fiscal sense.
Fishbein said he supports families of those incarcerated, but the governor has to make “difficult” decisions when laying out a budget. 
Howard said, “The budget is a finite resource … at some point in time there are certain things that have to be cut out.” 
For now, individuals in Connecticut correctional facilities may send up to 10 messages a day free of charge. Several people, including Brown, said they believed that should be expanded. Brown suggested allowing for photos and videos to be shared, and adding video-chatting capabilities.

His wife, Ivelisse Correa-Brown, is also an advocate, serving as executive director of ‘The Good Trouble Coalition’, which supports the rights of incarcerated individuals, and as vice president of local Black Lives Matter group ‘BLM860’.
She said the proposed budget cut would take away a crucial avenue for incarcerated people to flag problems around welfare in state prisons, as well as seek legal representation. Messaging was especially important for the couple during COVID, when in-person visits at the correctional institution were restricted.
“Messaging provided a method for people to express themselves to their loved ones,” she said. They “let family know if they were only getting two hours outside a day or if they were being treated well.” 
The Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is also opposed to the cuts. In an emailed statement, Executive Director David McGuire wrote: “The state cannot balance the budget on the backs of Black and brown people, as it has for more than 200 years. Continuing to fund free communication services is both the morally correct and fiscally responsible thing to do because family unity and connection reduce recidivism and helps build thriving communities.” 
Jermaine Davis is carrying out a sentence at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, Connecticut. In a message to The Connecticut Mirror, he said he uses the system for multiple purposes and he’s anxious to see it remain.
“Receiving a message from my family and friends … can allow incarcerated individuals to feel some type of normalcy in today’s time,” Davis said. “Using e-messaging I am able to effectively communicate with my mother, prepare myself for future employment opportunities, for preparation of community release and religious purposes.”

Bianca Tylek, a prison reform advocate, said she was concerned free e-messaging couldn’t be cut without removing communications entirely. “It has created a lot of confusion,” she said.
Alex Taubes, a criminal justice attorney based in New Haven, said the proposed cut could cause financial challenges for the loved ones of incarcerated individuals. “It’s ultimately the family members of people who are incarcerated, who want to keep in touch with their loved ones, who end up spending the most money,” he said.
Brown is currently seeking a sentence modification while on parole. After finishing a four-year sentence on burglary charges, he said he is ready to see his life move forward. But without the support that free texts gave him, he does not believe he could have come this far. 
Rather than cutting back, Brown said he thinks the state should expand communications services for people in correctional facilities. Specifically, doubling the number of free messages allowed, he said, “would make the inmates very grateful.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC00347-scaled-e1741370961635-1024x649.jpg,,,2025-04-11 14:10:53.607024

(Stock photo by Getty Images)A top priority for Gov. Ron DeSantis this legislative session is to prohibit healthcare providers and facilities from discriminating against patients based solely on vaccination status.
That moved closer to becoming law when a Senate panel this week on a 5-3 vote, to approve the bill (SB 1270), which amends the existing “Florida Patient’s Bill of Rights” and includes provision related to medical marijuana treatment centers and physician licensing.
DeSantis argues that lawmakers need to permanently enshrine policy changes he put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic.
But some of the language drew opposition from Republicans, including Sen. Gayle Harrell, who has long supported the positions of organized medicine, such as the Florida Medical and Florida Osteopathic associations. 
She was one of the three “no” votes on the bill Thursday in the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services meeting.
The bill requires physicians to treat patients, regardless of whether they reject their advice to be vaccinated, Harrell said, and provides them with no protection against potential medical malpractice lawsuits.
Medical marijuana
The mandate for doctors to treat unvaccinated patients wasn’t the only concern committee members had with the proposal. Bill sponsor Sen. Jay Collins tagged an amendment onto the proposal addressing background screenings that adds in statutory definitions of owners, managers, and employees at medical marijuana treatment centers. 
Collins said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told him the changes were necessary if the state wants to continue to tap into that agency’s background check system. But Sens. Lori Berman, Jason Brodeur, and Joe Gruters (A Democrat and two Republicans), worried the definitions might be too broad.
“You’ve got publicly traded companies in marijuana. So would some poor person who just gets on their Schwab account and goes to invest in some company need to get background checks because he’s doing some kind of publicly traded company? Because I’m worried about it.”
Collins said, “I don’t believe that is the intent of this law.”
Tweaking the 2024 law
Another provision tweaks legislation Collins spearheaded last year (SB 1600) regarding professions regulated by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPRS) as well as the Florida Department of Health (DOH).
Specific to the DOH, the 2024 law eliminated a statute regarding medical licensure by endorsement and created a new universal endorsement statute that applies to medical doctors and a dozen-plus other medical professionals. Licensure by endorsement is the route for any doctor who holds a medical license in one state but applies to practice in another.
The 2024 law eliminated the Board of Medicine’s ability to approve by endorsement any physician applying for Florida licensure who:

 Has a complaint, an allegation, or an investigation pending before a licensing entity in another state or territory.
Has been convicted of, or pleaded no contest to, any felony or misdemeanor related to the practice of a healthcare profession, regardless of adjudication, 
Has had a healthcare provider license revoked or suspended by another state,
Has voluntarily surrendered any license in lieu of having disciplinary action taken against the license.
Has been reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank, which includes medical malpractice settlements.

The National Practitioner Data Bank includes information on medical malpractice settlements.
Although SB 1600 made it harder for domestically trained physicians to be licensed in Florida, another 2024 bill signed into law by DeSantis (SB 7016) allowed internationally trained physicians to be licensed by endorsement as long as they graduated from World Health Organization-recognized medical schools and complete international medical residencies that are “substantially similar” to those endorsed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
Members of the Board of Medicine complained the Legislature was making it harder for domestically trained physicians to get licensed in Florida but easier for internationally trained physicians, and considered asking DeSantis to veto Collins’ bill but did not.
Aware of the angst, Collins includes a fix: SB 1270 tweaks the 2024 law to allow the BOM to approve an applicant’s licensure by endorsement as long as the offense reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank “would not constitute a violation of any law or rule in this state.”
Collins said the DOH supports the bill. State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is secretary of the department. The House companion measure (HB 1299), meanwhile, is slated to be heard by the  House Health & Human Services Committee next.

Jimmy Hickey, R-Texarkana, chairs a meeting of the Senate Committee on Revenue and Taxation on April 9, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Long days and nights at the Capitol were the norm during the 12th week of the legislative session as Arkansas lawmakers rushed to get their bills considered ahead of their April 16 deadline. 
Legislators sent to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders a bill that would establish harsher penalties for undocumented migrants who commit felonies, one of her priorities for the session. They also advanced bills that would amend the state’s social media age verification law that was blocked in federal court and would allow parents to sue social media platforms for harming minors, additional legislative priorities for Sanders. 
While the immigration bill still awaited the governor’s signature as of midday Friday, Sanders signed several other bills into law this week, including one that would clarify Arkansas’ public meetings law by specifying what city council, quorum court and school board members can discuss outside of a public meeting.
Meanwhile, lawmakers advanced legislation that sponsors hope will make it to the governor’s desk next week, including bills that would increase the asset limit for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients, prohibit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices and policies in local government and repeal a statewide mandate for public water system fluoridation.
A committee also voted down a bill Wednesday that would extend Medicaid coverage for women to 12 months after birth if they don’t already qualify for the state’s Medicaid expansion program. Sanders has repeatedly said 12-month postpartum coverage would be “redundant” and “duplicative” because the state has other insurance coverage options.

1) Prison funding
After five failed votes, a $750 million prison appropriation bill appeared dead Thursday as lawmakers struggled to secure the necessary votes to clear the Senate. Lawmakers are considering the appropriation to help fund an estimated $825 million capital project to build a new state prison in Franklin County. 
The 3,000-bed project has been rife with controversy since it was announced last fall, and that battle continued to play out on the Senate floor this week as lawmakers failed to gain enough support for the measure on Monday and Tuesday. 
Searcy Republican and Senate Bill 354 sponsor Sen. Jonathan Dismang said Thursday he doesn’t think failure to approve SB 354 will be detrimental to the project. The Arkansas Board of Corrections already has $75 million it can use to move forward, and lawmakers can revisit funding during the fiscal session next spring, he said. 
2) Library board
Public library advocates experienced whiplash this week as they celebrated the defeat of one bill and then had to consider the threat of a new one less than 24 hours later.
An Arkansas House committee on Wednesday evening rejected Senate Bill 536, a bill that would abolish the State Library and its board. Less than two hours later, Dismang filed Senate Bill 640, legislation that would remove all seven members of the State Library Board and allow Sanders to replace them later this year.

SB 640 received initial committee approval Thursday morning and passed the full Senate in the afternoon. The bill was fast-tracked after the Senate suspended rules that generally require at least a day between committee approval and considering a bill on the floor.
The bill is scheduled to be heard by a House committee Monday morning.
3) Buffalo River
Amendments have garnered new support for a bill that environmental advocates feared would endanger a moratorium on large animal farms in the Buffalo River watershed. 
Following negotiations with Senate Bill 290’s House sponsor, Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, leaders of the Arkansas Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy and Environment said they were on board with the legislation.
The watershed moratorium, which has been in effect for a decade, has been the source of a battle this session between environmentalists who fought for the initial ban and agricultural interests that said it infringed on private property rights. 
The amended version of SB 209 cleared a House committee Thursday and will attempt to make its way to the governor’s desk next week.

4) New Bills
Lawmakers filed about 30 new bills by midday Friday, including: 
House Bill 1996 by Rep. Zach Gramlich, R-Fort Smith, would establish an educational alternative to civil penalties for certain violations related to child labor. 
House Bill 1999 by Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, would require the state’s education secretary to provide information about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to certain students.
Senate Bill 632 by Sen. Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, would require hair relaxers that contain a carcinogen or reproductive toxicant to require a warning label.
Senate Bill 641 by Sen. Dave Wallace, R-Leachville, would allow a sheriff to house work-release program participants. 
Lawmakers return to Little Rock on Monday for the final three days of the session. With the Senate poised to consider as many as 100 bills on Monday alone, legislative leaders said members should be prepared for more long days as they work to conclude their work by Wednesday. 
Meeting schedules, agendas and livestreams are available on the Arkansas Legislature’s website.

(Courtesy image)The Montana House unanimously passed a bill addressing how vehicles approach roundabouts on Friday, specifically adding stipulations into the law giving preference for vehicles towing a load.
Senate Bill 433, brought by Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, changes regulations for how vehicles approach roundabouts. Hauling vehicles will legally be allowed to deviate from their lane to move through a traffic circle. Other autos in the roundabout must yield to hauling vehicles.
Manzella said during a House Transportation Committee hearing on March 21 the legislation stemmed from discussions over a roundabout on Highway 93 at its intersection with Bell Crossing near Victor and subsequent town halls about the topic. “When you are a tow vehicle pulling a trailer, we feel that that tow vehicle needs to be given the right-of- way,” Manzella said. “Because of the fact that when you’re entering the roundabout, your rear tires don’t necessarily track. They want to crowd to the inside.”
There’s also usually a berm on roundabouts, Manzella said, which can cause whatever’s being hauled around to move around. Constituents said this was the problem, and it’s also been a complaint from trucking companies across the country.
“For me, it’s my horses, which are precious, and I don’t dare bludgeon them,” Manzella said. “ …I have had that happen before, where they have injured their pretty little faces, pushing themselves, getting bumped into the trailer wall.”
The bill will also have an impact on double-lane roundabouts, which can be used on four-lane highways. It allows trailers to legally deviate from one of the lanes.
Manzella’s legislation received support from the Montana Department of Transportation, which maintains a database of roundabouts across the state. Roundabouts are generally safer than four-way intersections, as the possibility of T-bone collisions is drastically reduced, according to MDOT.
“Not every intersection demands a roundabout, but for those that do, this is an important tool for us to have in our toolbox, and any effort that we can make to make them safer is a welcome opportunity,” said Larry Flynn, MDOT deputy director during the bill’s House hearing. “I think this is a good, common sense approach to help improve the safety of an already safe tool.”
After a final procedural approval in the House, the bill will head to the governor’s desk.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/double-roundabout-1024x496.jpg,,,2025-04-11 14:10:53.607024

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Vanessa Baker brought more than just testimony to the State House basement Thursday. 
She came armed with inhalers, eye drops, nose spray, and ibuprofen, the medication she relies on to treat the constant symptoms triggered by lingering cigarette smoke at Bally’s casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton, where she works as an iGaming supervisor.
There was a time she was able to stop using them: when Bally’s temporarily banned smoking after it reopened Rhode Island’s two casinos which had been closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But those rules were lifted by March 2022.
“It took me nine months to get put back on all that medication and I had to take a sick leave of absence for six months to get my lungs back to where I could work,” Baker told the House Committee on Finance. “There’s no safe ventilation that’s protecting us.”
Which is why she and other employees are once again pushing lawmakers to pass a bill sponsored by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, that would put an end to Bally’s two-decade exemption from the state’s indoor smoking ban.
It’s a proposal Tanzi has filed each session since 2021, usually stalling at the committee level, although House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi allowed a symbolic vote to advance the bill last year. He is now one of the 10 cosponsors listed on the latest edition of the bill.
The growing support in the House mirrors overall sentiment in Rhode Island. The AFL-CIO in February released a poll that found nearly 7 in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.
Rep. George Nardone, a Coventry Republican, told the Bally’s representative before him Thursday that he continues to “draw the short straw” in testifying against the proposal.
“It’s cruel to make people that are not smokers have to inhale some and work in [that] environment — and they have to stay there based on their job,” he said. “I think the state made a mistake giving you guys an exemption.”
But the company remains firmly opposed to the annual proposal. 
Craig Sculos, Bally’s senior vice president of Rhode Island Regulatory Relations, told the committee that allowing smoking attracts customers coming in from out of state. Massachusetts does not allow smoking at any of its casinos, nor is it allowed at the two tribal-run facilities in Connecticut.
“Should all the regional casinos maintain a non-smoking policy, players are expected to do what players normally do: They’ll go to the casino that’s closest,” Sculos said. 
He argued that the smoking sections of the casinos generate more revenue than the non-smoking areas, pointing to slot machines that average $200 more in daily play within the smoking zones.
“You set the floor like you set a menu in your restaurant, you set based upon player demand,” Sculos said. “If we were to see capacity switch the other way — we would make that change.” 
Matt Dunham, president of Table Game Dealers Laborers Local 711, refuted the idea that smoking provides Bally’s a market advantage over its neighbors. He called Bally’s a “casino of convenience” — central, away from Boston traffic, and allows people as young as 18 to play.
“It is not because people can smoke while they are in the building,” he said. “And I can all but guarantee that the same customers will still be there, they’ll just be smoking outside of the buildings.”

Sculos said rules already prohibit patrons from smoking directly at gaming tables and employees can request non-smoking areas as shift availability allows.
But those shifts aren’t easy to get. Bill DelSanto, a table dealer at Bally’s Twin River Casino in Lincoln, told the finance committee those shifts are given based on seniority. 
Beverage server Karen Gorman also told lawmakers that trying to pick up non-smoking shifts isn’t an option at the Tiverton location where she works.
“Even if I had that ability, I would still have to walk through the smoke,” she said. “I don’t want to get cancer. I want to feed my family, I want to buy groceries, I want to pay for my daughter’s taekwondo, and for a college education.”
Tanzi’s bill was held for further study by the committee, as is standard for an initial vetting by a legislative panel. Companion legislation introduced Feb. 7 by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming Relations.

During the celebration, Buchanan received a delivery of marijuana. After smoking, he says he began having a paranoid episode.
“I ended up smoking something that was laced and it caused me to flip out,” Buchanan said.
Buchanan became convinced the others were trying to kill him or put him in jail. He shot his stepfather, William Jefferson, his aunt, Juanita Hoffman, and his girlfriend, Angela Brown.
His two daughters, Dreisha, 2 years old, and Drejanay, six months old, were both with Brown when Buchanan shot her.
The prosecutor wanted the death penalty, and even though the jury deadlocked on whether to do it the judge sentenced him to die. 
Three years later, the Missouri Supreme Court changed his sentence to life in prison without parole, which should have been great news. But in reality, for more than 20 years it’s blocked him from seeking relief that could allow him to get out of prison. 
That’s why on Monday, Boone County Circuit Judge Jeff Harris will hold the first hearing on Buchanan’s motion seeking to reopen his original criminal case. The case review hearing is a routine but essential step toward determining whether Buchanan should have been present in court when his new sentence was imposed.
Neither the Supreme Court nor the trial judge, Boone County Circuit Judge Gene Hamilton, pronounced the new sentence in his presence.
While there is a statute allowing the Supreme Court to make the change on its own, other statutes and court precedent require felony sentencing to prison to be done with the defendant present.
“I was never legally sentenced,” Buchanan said in a recent interview at the Jefferson City Corrections Center.
The failure to sentence him in person is a denial of his rights under Missouri law, public defender Tyler Coyle wrote in the motion to reopen the case.
“Mr. Buchanan has a due process right to be personally present at the time of the resentencing hearing,” Coyle wrote.
The new sentence imposed in 2003 by the high court is noted in the docket of Buchanan’s case.
“The resentencing itself could only lead to the life without parole sentence, but then the resentencing opens the door for the post-conviction relief motion that he’s never gotten a chance to argue on the merits,” Coyle said in an interview.
The case is testing a question that has never been decided by a Missouri court, said Joe Welling, an adjunct professor at St. Louis University Law School who teaches a seminar on death penalty law. 
“It’s very fascinating,” Welling said. “If I had to predict what would happen with this motion, the first thing I would say is the trial court is going to say we no longer have jurisdiction over this case that left us a long, long time ago, like 10 days after they finalized their sentence.”
That result, Coyle said, would lead to an appeal and, ultimately, the Supreme Court ruling on how it handled the case in 2003. 
“We’ll  get a ruling, and then our options, if he rules against us, would either be to appeal or file a writ,” Coyle said.
 Unheard defense

During his 23 years in state custody, Buchanan has tried several times to initiate court cases to review his 2002 conviction for first degree murder.
Usually acting as his own attorney, the result was always dismissal with few actual hearings.
Buchanan doesn’t deny his guilt. He spoke at length about his case in an episode of the Netflix series “I am a Killer.”
“We can never change the fact that my family members lost their lives, my girl, my friend, was shot,” Buchanan said. “You can’t put time on that.”
But he claims he has no memory of the crime.
“I finally came to, and I asked the lady, she was like, ‘Do you know what you are here for?’” Buchanan said. “And I was like, no, what happened? And she told me, and tears came down my face.”
Buchanan believes the marijuana he smoked was laced with PCP, a hallucinogenic drug also called angel dust that can cause paranoid, dissociative episodes, with profuse sweating and convulsions at high doses.
“According to the police report, I was sweating so hard, profusely sweating, to where they had to keep using my shirt to wipe the mucus coming out of my nose and my mouth,” Buchanan said.
No blood or urine tests were done while Buchanan was held and interrogated. He said sweat was extracted from his clothing and tested positive for PCP, but motions for a continuance for additional tests were denied.
The circumstances of the killings, Buchanan said, mean he should have been charged with second degree murder because he was incapable of the deliberation required by law.
The penalty for second degree murder includes a possibility of parole. 
He credits his perseverance in efforts to change his sentence to encouragement from his grandfather.
His grandfather, a minister, advised him to study the law. 
“He said nothing’s perfect, according to Scripture, about man, so how can man-made laws govern your situation ever be perfect?” Buchanan said. “And I was like, wow. So a light bulb came on at that moment, and it never, ever has went off. It only has gotten brighter.”
 Death penalty law

 The Jefferson City Correctional Center (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Missouri has eight men on death row awaiting execution.
To be placed there, each went through a two-part trial. In the first, a jury had to unanimously find that a defendant is guilty of killing another person after deliberation. 
Then, following additional testimony and argument, the jury must find unanimously that the crime fits into one of 17 statutory aggravators that include being “outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman,” perpetrated to gain money, silence a witness or being part of gang activity.
A jury also looks for mitigating factors that argue against death.
The bifurcated trial is the result of U.S. Supreme Court decisions from the 1970s intended to prevent arbitrary and disproportional penalties, Welling said.
“There’s just no way to explain why these few people got death, and all these other people with what looks like the same type of cases didn’t,” Welling said.
One of the key rulings defining legal standards for a death penalty is the 2002 decision in Ring v Arizona. The court decided that when a jury cannot agree on death, and makes no report on whether it found aggravating circumstances that allow a death penalty, it cannot be imposed.
Every death penalty case in Missouri is automatically sent to the Missouri Supreme Court on appeal, where the penalty is reviewed for proportionality and constitutionality.
Buchanan is one of 10 men on death row in Missouri who had their sentences changed to life in prison without parole because their original sentence was unconstitutional as a result of the Ring decision.
From 2003 until 2019, judges were unable to impose a death penalty in Missouri if the jury deadlocked on punishment. That changed when the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that if a jury unanimously found aggravators to be present, a judge could impose death without a unanimous recommendation for the punishment from the jury.
“We’re very much an outlier,” Welling said. “Right now, in the majority of capital states, if the jury can’t decide, it’s automatically life.”
This year, state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican from Arnold, filed a bill to require a unanimous recommendation for a death penalty from juries for the sentence to be imposed. She got the bill to the Senate floor for debate, but it stalled and she said it is dead for the year.
“A lot of people feel very strongly about the death penalty, obviously,” Coleman said. “Whether you’re in favor of or opposed to the death penalty, it’s a really common sense proposition that a jury of your peers should find you guilty and one person shouldn’t have the ability to decide whether you live and die on behalf of the state.”
There are other men in custody in Missouri who had their sentence changed and have not raised the issues Buchanan is asking the court to consider.
“I imagine that most people who got their death sentence converted to life without parole never challenge that any further, because they’re happy with that result,” Coyle said. “But Buchanan feels that even life without parole is too much, because he feels that the involuntary intoxication defense is more important.”
 Buchanan’s goal

Buchanan, who is 51, knows that he has many more years in prison ahead of him.
He said he works to help other inmates as part of a peer support program.
“We hold staff accountable in a professional way,” Buchanan said. “We hold prisoners accountable in a professional way. We bridge the gap as institutional peer support.”
If he gets the immediate relief he is seeking, he will get a chance to argue in post-conviction hearings that he was involuntarily intoxicated by PCP at the time of the murders. 
That could get him a new trial.
“Marijuana at the time was not a legal substance,” Buchanan said. But now that they passed the initiative on the ballot, and they enacted this new law in Missouri to legalize recreational marijuana, they made it retroactive. So now the evidence in my case will be considered to be legal, to be able to be used right to show this is how this got in my system.”
There is no likelihood that he could receive the death penalty again because that sentence was overturned for the first case, Coyle said.
The hopes are slim. 
Buchanan knows he should not expect to ever be released, but thinks of how he could help his six children and five grandchildren.
“I can’t say I deserve parole,” Buchanan said. “I can’t sit there and tell you that, but I look at it like one day, I hope God can touch the people to allow me to be in a position to have parole so I can, you know, have a better relationship with all my children.”

“Everything we care about now is at stake in our country,” Bennet said in a short announcement speech. “Business as usual is simply not enough, and that’s why I’m running for governor of Colorado.”
Before rumors of his interest began circulating in recent months, Bennet — the son of a Washington diplomat and a bipartisan dealmaker who seemed at home in the Senate cloakroom — was rarely named by Colorado political observers as a potential candidate for governor.
“I expect this decision might have come as a surprise to some of you,” Susan Daggett, Bennet’s wife, said while introducing him. “Although not to me.”

With his entry, he becomes the heavy favorite in a race that had been expected to be a wide-open contest between multiple up-and-coming Colorado Democrats. Gov. Jared Polis, who has served as governor since 2019, is term-limited. Attorney General Phil Weiser is the only other prominent Democrat to have entered the race so far.
If he is sworn in as governor in January 2027, Bennet, 60, will have served two full Senate terms and parts of two others. He was first appointed to his seat by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009, after former U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar was named as President Barack Obama’s secretary of the Interior Department. As governor, he would have the power to appoint his own replacement, who would serve out the remaining two years of his term before the seat comes up for election again in 2028.
In the Senate, Bennet has been a champion for the expanded child tax credit, a temporary version of which was enacted as part of a COVID pandemic relief package in 2020. The measure cut child poverty in half while in effect, but it lapsed in the face of opposition to a permanent version among Republicans and former Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Other legislation backed by Bennet during his Senate tenure includes billions in funding for Western water projects in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act; a measure aimed at increasing broadband access; a proposal to regulate orphaned oil and gas wells; and a handful of protections for Colorado public lands.
He last won reelection with a landslide 2022 victory over Republican Joe O’Dea. He ran for president in 2020, dropping out after placing 11th in the New Hampshire primary with fewer than 1,000 votes.
Bennet and fellow Democrat John Hickenlooper, the other U.S. senator from Colorado, have come under fire from progressive Democrats for their approach to the second Trump administration, including their votes in favor of confirming some of President Donald Trump’s high-profile Cabinet nominees. Together, they’ve been statistical outliers in the Senate Democratic caucus, voting with Trump’s agenda far more often than would be expected based on Colorado’s partisan vote share.
Bennet has argued that Democrats need to “select our battles” after being “repudiated” in the 2024 election. As he took steps towards a run for governor, Bennet told Meet the Press on March 30 that he was “considering where the best place to have this fight is, and where the best place to reinvent the Democratic Party is.”
“I fundamentally believe that we will never preserve our democracy unless people know they have real opportunity — real economic opportunity for themselves and for their kids,” Bennet said. “That is the American dream, and it’s our obligation to make it a reality for every single Coloradan.”
An upended race
The upended 2026 governor’s race marks the second time in recent Colorado political history that a wide-open race for statewide office has been scrambled by the unexpected entrance of a heavy favorite.
In 2019, a half dozen prominent Democrats had thrown their hat in the ring for the party’s nomination for U.S. senator before Hickenlooper, a former governor mounting a doomed presidential bid, abruptly switched to the Senate race instead. Within weeks, all but one of Hickenlooper’s opponents dropped out, and he eased to a primary victory over former state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff.
In addition to Weiser, rumored contenders for governor in 2026 had included Salazar, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, and U.S. Reps. Joe Neguse and Jason Crow. No major Democratic candidate has entered the race since Bennet aides first publicly floated the possibility of his gubernatorial bid in February. 
Last week, Griswold announced she would run for attorney general instead. Neguse and Crow both quickly endorsed Bennet on Friday morning, as did a long list of other Colorado Democrats including Hickenlooper, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, state Senate President James Coleman and state House Speaker Julie McCluskie.
“There is no one we trust more to lead our state and build a brighter future for families across Colorado than Michael Bennet,” Neguse said in a statement.
Weiser’s campaign sounded a defiant note as news broke of Bennet’s candidacy on Thursday, issuing a statement that contained implicit criticism of the senator’s approach to the Trump administration.
“We must protect Colorado and oppose Trump’s illegal actions, not appease him,” Weiser said. “I am the fighter Colorado needs as our next governor.”
“Two years ago, the voters sent Sen. Bennet back to D.C. because we believed he would be there for us no matter what — especially in historically dangerous moments like the one we currently face,” his statement added. “Now more than ever, we need experienced Democratic leaders in Washington.”
Coloradans have not elected a Republican governor since 2002. Republican candidates who have announced a run for governor in 2026 include state Sen. Mark Baisley, state Rep. Scott Bottoms and Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell. 
Unlikely role reversal
Bennet’s decision sets the stage for what once would have seemed an unlikely role reversal for Colorado’s two current Democratic U.S. senators.
Hickenlooper and Bennet have been close allies since 2003, when the former, a successful restaurateur who had just been elected mayor of Denver, tapped the latter, a friend and fellow Wesleyan University graduate, to be his chief of staff.
But in the ensuing years they had taken different paths in their political careers, and when they faced each other on a presidential primary debate stage in 2019, they presented a contrast in styles — the folksy Hickenlooper touting his executive experience as a mayor and governor, the erudite Bennet pitching himself as a seasoned Washington operator.
Now, Hickenlooper — who declared after departing the governor’s mansion in 2019 that D.C. was “a lousy place” and he was “not cut out to be a senator” — is running for a second six-year Senate term at age 73.
And Bennet — a Beltway native and Senate institutionalist who has spoken reverently of the “world’s greatest deliberative body” and expressed regret over the erosion of traditional norms like the judicial filibuster — now intends to depart Congress amid an unprecedented assault on the legislative branch’s powers by the Trump administration.
“Our best solutions to these challenges will not come from the broken politics practiced in Washington,” Bennet said in a campaign launch video. “They will come from us, and that’s why I’m running for governor.”

Jeff Landry has picked Bruce Greenstein, for health secretary of Louisiana. Greenstein is pictured here with former Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Gov. Jeff Landry has selected a former Gov. Bobby Jindal cabinet member who was charged with lying to a grand jury under oath to oversee billions of dollars of spending as the Louisiana Department of Health secretary. 
The Republican governor picked Bruce Greenstein, one of Landry’s largest political donors who previously worked for Donald Trump, to run the state health department for a second time. In the position, Greenstein would oversee Louisiana’s $21.4 billion health care budget, including its $19 billion Medicaid program.

Greenstein first served as Louisiana health secretary under Jindal from 2010-13. He was forced out of the job after Jindal discovered the federal government was investigating Greenstein’s role in the award of a nearly $200 million state Medicaid contract to Greenstein’s previous employer, Client Network Services Inc. (CNSI). 
The federal government never brought charges against Greenstein, and the former health secretary was never convicted of a crime. A state grand jury indicted him on perjury charges, but Greenstein was never prosecuted on them. He repeatedly denied all wrongdoing at the time. 
The Illuminator first reported last week that Landry intended to pick Greenstein as his top health care official. Greenstein did not respond to calls or messages from a reporter sent to his cell phone in the hours before the announcement of his hiring Friday.

“Having served as Secretary of Health in Louisiana before, I know firsthand the unique challenges and opportunities our state faces,” Greenstein said in written statement provided by Landry’s office. “Now, as I step into this role again, I’m more committed than ever to building on the progress we’ve made and driving meaningful change.”

In order for him to hold the job permanently, the Louisiana Senate will have to confirm Greenstein as health secretary during lawmakers’ upcoming session that starts Monday. 
Even though Jindal pushed Greenstein out of his job in 2013, the former Louisiana governor had nothing but praise last week for Landry’s decision to hire Greenstein. 
“Bruce would be a great choice. He has a great mix of private sector, federal and state experience. He would hit the ground running, and not need on the job training,” Jindal said in a written statement last Friday. “He would work tirelessly to improve health outcomes and control costs.” 
Despite his legal troubles, Greenstein is an attractive hire for Landry because he is familiar with public health care financing, particularly Medicaid. Many people in Landry’s administration do not have long-term experience in health care accounting, federal Medicaid regulations or the state budget.
“There is no one more qualified than Bruce,” Landry said in a written statement Friday. “I look forward to the great work he, Doctor Abraham, and the entire LDH team will do for the State of Louisiana.” 

As the new secretary, Greenstein replaces Michael Harrington, a former hospital executive who held the top position at the health department for eight months before resigning in March.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
A little over a decade ago, former Attorney General Buddy Caldwell convened the state grand jury that indicted Greenstein. He was charged with nine counts of perjury for allegedly lying to a Louisiana Senate committee and the grand jury about a state Medicaid contract with his former employer CNSI. 
Those state charges against Greenstein were eventually dropped by Landry after he beat Caldwell in the 2015 election for attorney general, a job Landry held for eight years before becoming governor. 
At the time, Landry’s staff said they didn’t think the state could meet the burden of proof to convict Greenstein. The prosecutor on the case, Caldwell’s son, David, had left the attorney general’s office shortly after Landry defeated his father in the election. 
CNSI, which changed its name to Acentra Health after a merger in 2023, also gave Landry’s campaign and a Landry political action committee $52,500 during his race against Caldwell, according to campaign finance reports. 
Greenstein, who pleaded not guilty in the state perjury case, initially said he had very little contact with CNSI as the company bid for Louisiana’s Medicaid business. 

An investigation later revealed Greenstein had exchanged hundreds of messages with its executives. He also recommended state officials adjust the terms of the state Medicaid bid, which allowed CNSI to meet the criteria and apply for the work. 
At the time, Greenstein defended himself by saying his exchanges with CNSI executives were mostly personal and that he never took a bribe from the company. He’s good friends with some of his former CNSI coworkers, and the conversations were casual, he said.

“It never crossed my mind that my friends or my texts were with a company,” Greenstein told a grand jury in late 2014. 
After the charges were dropped, Greenstein went on to join Trump’s administration as the chief technology officer at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In 2018, he left the federal government to become an executive at LHC Group, a Lafayette business that was, at the time, one of the country’s largest home health care companies. The company has since been sold to UnitedHealth, a national insurance company that also manages one of Louisiana’s Medicaid plans. 
LHC Group’s founder and chief executive officer emeritus, Keith Myers, is one of the biggest political donors to Landry, with contributions totaling more than $600,000 to his campaigns and PACs since 2017. Brach Myers, Keith’s son and another executive at LHC, is a state senator representing Lafayette. 
Though he was never convicted of a crime, Greenstein’s legal troubles cost Louisiana money years after he left state government. 
Independent of the grand jury investigation, Jindal canceled Louisiana’s contract with CNSI in 2013 on the grounds that Greenstein had inappropriate contact with the company during the state bid process. This resulted in CNSI suing Louisiana for wrongful termination, a legal dispute that dragged on for years until former Gov. John Bel Edwards settled with the company in 2016.
Before the case was settled, CNSI’s attorneys had sought depositions from several members of the Jindal administration, including now-Attorney General Liz Murrill.

When the CNSI contract was canceled, Murrill was the general counsel for Jindal’s commissioner of administration, Kristy Nichols, and involved in the decision to give CNSI the boot. Nichols is now an executive at Ochsner Health, Louisiana’s largest hospital system. 
Despite his spotty past in state government, Landry has leaned on Greenstein for advice on health care policy for the past two years. Greenstein was one of 28 members on Landry’s health care advisory council after he won the gubernatorial election in 2023.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Greenstein-Pence-Trump-1024x743.jpg,,,2025-04-11 13:21:36.058661

SPRINGFIELD — Law enforcement officers would no longer be allowed to search a vehicle or detain a driver who is over age 21 based solely on the smell of burnt cannabis in the vehicle under a bill that passed Thursday in the Illinois Senate.

Senate Bill 42, sponsored by Sen. Rachel Ventura, D-Joliet, is a response to a September 2024 Illinois Supreme Court decision that held the smell of burnt cannabis alone was insufficient to establish probable cause for searching a vehicle without a warrant.

In a separate opinion from December, however, the court ruled the odor of raw cannabis coming from a vehicle is sufficient evidence to provide officers with probable cause for a search because the smell suggests cannabis is not being transported in an odor-proof container as required by state law.

Both of those decisions stemmed from Illinois’ landmark legislation, passed in 2019, legalizing adult use of recreational marijuana statewide.

The Senate bill calls for repealing one requirement in that law — that cannabis in a vehicle be kept in an “odor-proof” container, but it continues to require the cannabis be kept in a “sealed or reusable and child-resistant container that is inaccessible.”

“I want to be very clear that I encourage every driver to drive sober at all times,” Ventura said on the Senate floor. “This is directing law enforcement to take into the totality of the circumstances.”

But opponents of the bill said the proposed policy made no sense from a law enforcement standpoint.

“We would never, ever ask a police officer to disregard the odor of alcohol when they pull a car over,” said Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet. “Why on earth would we ask a police officer to disregard the odor of cannabis? At a minimum, they should have the duty to ensure that the driver is not impaired.”

The bill passed 33-20 and now heads to the House for consideration.

Bill extends press protections to university-based public media

The Illinois Senate passed legislation Thursday that would extend press protections to public media outlets, including NPR and PBS affiliates, that are operated by Illinois colleges and universities.

Senate Bill 1988, sponsored by Sen. Dave Koehler, D-Peoria, would also allow employees and contributors to seek judicial relief if they believe their rights have been violated.

Many public colleges and universities operate public broadcasting stations, a category of stations that were once referred to as “educational broadcasting.” In some cases, however, there have been complaints that university officials exercised powerful editorial control over those stations, especially regarding stories and material critical of the universities or their leadership.

The bill declares that all media produced at a state-sponsored institution of higher learning is a “public forum for expression by the employees producing the media” and that it “shall not be subject to prior review by public officials” of the institution.

Koehler did not cite any specific instances of university censorship or prior restraint at any Illinois stations, but he said those outlets should have the same protections from government censorship and restraint that other media outlets have.

“Public media plays an essential role in informing our communities,” Koehler said in a statement. “Ensuring their independence, accountability and trust is upheld is vital to democracy.”

The bill passed 36-19and now goes to the House.

Safe gun storage requirements advance in General Assembly

Illinois senators passed legislation Thursday that would require gun owners to keep their weapons securely stored so they are not accessible to minors.

Known as the Safe Guns Storage Act, Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Laura Ellman, D-Naperville, would require any firearms owner to store their firearm in a secured, locked container in any location where a minor or at-risk person could otherwise access the firearm.

The bill would also allow local law enforcement agencies to revoke a person’s Firearm Owner’s Identification card if they fail on two or more occasions to report a lost or stolen firearm within 48 hours.

“The sooner a firearm is reported lost or stolen, the more likely it is that law enforcement can investigate and recover that firearm before it's used to commit a crime,” Ellman said.

Sen. Neil Anderson, R-Andalusia, took issue with law enforcement being granted the ability to revoke a person’s FOID card. He said that aspect of the bill would not be consistent with the 2023 United States v. Rahimi Supreme Court case, which ruled a person’s firearm owner identification can be temporarily revoked if a court determines they are a threat to public safety when in possession of a firearm.

Ellman disagreed. She said that the case did not exclude law enforcement from being able to revoke a person’s FOID card.

The bill passed on a vote of 33-19 and goes to the House.

Reynolds has served as governor since 2017, when she was appointed to the position after serving as lieutenant governor under former Gov. Terry Branstad, who left the position to serve as U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump’s first term. Reynolds was elected to serve a full-term as governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022.
Reynolds, the first woman to serve as Iowa governor, said in a video posted on social media Friday that deciding not to run “wasn’t an easy decision,” but she planned to focus on her family after completing her current term in office.
“As Iowans know, family is everything,” Reynolds said. “And through the years, my parents and my husband Kevin, our daughters and our grandchildren, have stood by my side, supporting me through every challenge and every victory. And now it’s time for me to be there for them, to help them through the next stage of life, to watch every track meet and basketball game, to see them grow before they’re all grown.”

The governor’s husband, Kevin Reynolds, was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2023. In 2024, Gov. Reynolds said that her husband was in remission after radiation and chemotherapy treatments and was able to return to activities like hunting, fishing and spending time with the couple’s family. The couple has three daughters and 11 grandchildren.
During her time as governor, Reynolds has pushed for a flat income tax and lowering tax rates, enacting the Education Savings Account program to provide public funds for private K-12 school tuition and associated costs, and making changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies that provide special education and other services to Iowa schools. This year, Reynolds signed into law a measure repealing civil rights protections on the basis of gender identity under the Iowa Civil Rights Act.
Despite her decision to not run again in 2026, Reynolds says she is not “slowing down just yet” and will continue for her remaining time in office to work on issues she said will help improve Iowans’ lives.
“We have important work ahead, keeping our economy strong, supporting our families and farmers, defending our freedoms and ensuring that every Iowan has the opportunity to succeed,” Reynolds said. “I’m more energized than ever to finish what we started, and to leave Iowa in the strongest possible position for the future.”
After her announcement, Iowa Republicans shared their gratitude for Reynolds’ service as governor. State Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver said in a news release he looks forward to continuing to work with Reynolds for the rest of her term.
“Many times I have told people Iowa has the best governor in the country and I firmly believe it is true,” Whitver said in a statement. “Together, with Speakers (Linda) Upmeyer and (Pat) Grassley, we have delivered truly historic results for Iowans few people could have dreamed possible. Not only is Governor Reynolds the best governor in the country, leading the state through unprecedented times with courage and conviction, but she is also my friend. Her concern and kindness for my family and me has been so encouraging to us through many difficult days.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson said in a statement she joins “every Iowan in saying thank you — we are all grateful for your love of Iowa and your dedication to our state.”
“The next governor no doubt has big shoes to fill — we need a governor who can build on Governor Reynolds’ tremendous success and partner with President Trump to keep Iowa growing,” Hinson said.
It has yet to be determined who might run as the Republican nominee for governor in the upcoming 2026 general election.  One Republican, Brad Sherman, a former GOP state representative, announced in February his bid for the position, but others are expected to join the race.
The governor said in her video she believes the Iowa Republican Party is in a strong position heading into the next election.
“I have no doubt that Iowa and our Republican Party will remain in great hands,” Reynolds said. “Together, we have built a foundation of strong conservative leadership that will continue to serve this state well. I’ve seen firsthand the passion and dedication of so many leaders, and I am confident that the next generation will continue to build on our success.”
Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann said in a social media post that the governor has put Iowa in a strong position moving forward.
“Gov. Reynolds has been a generational leader for our state and party,” Kaufmann wrote. “Under her bold, conservative leadership, Iowa now sits as one of the best states in the entire country. Taxes are low, cash reserves are full, our freedoms defended, and Iowa’s future has never been brighter.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025condition2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-11 13:21:36.058661

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The House approved a bill Thursday fueled by issues at landfills in the state managing leachate, or the “trash juice” created when rain mixes with waste.
The state already requires landfill applicants to create plans for managing leachate, but House Bill 566 would require more details about the treatment of that liquid pollution and transportation for those that treat it off site. 
This legislation would put the existing requirement for leachate management plans into statute, in addition to setting more detailed standards. It would include language that requires DES, before issuing a permit, to make a positive determination that the permit application includes a detailed leachate management plan. 
Harmful chemicals from trash seep into leachate, meaning its mismanagement can pose serious environmental and public health risks. Those risks were put on display last year when the Department of Environmental Services found several landfills in the state failing to manage leachate as required. That included hundreds of violations in Bethlehem at the landfill run by Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems. 
The House approved the bill on a voice vote of the consent calendar, meaning the committee recommendation to pass the legislation was OK’d without debate, among a host of other bills. The House Finance Committee, as well as the House Environment and Agriculture Committee, recommended the bill unanimously. 
The state currently requires landfills to: have at least two locations for leachate disposal; estimate how much leachate they will generate; and describe how leachate will be handled at the landfill before being shipped somewhere else for disposal, according to DES. They must also have procedures in place to bring down leachate levels to a foot or lower within a week of a 100-year storm event. Regulations also include details about on-site leachate management systems.
The bill is one of several this year aimed at waste issues. Two of those bills — House Bill 171, to establish a three-year moratorium on new landfills, and House Bill 707, which aims to strengthen the state’s siting standards for landfills — will appear before a Senate committee on Tuesday.

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Mikal Mahdi, who pleaded guilty to two murders committed during a crime spree, is scheduled to become the second inmate in the state executed by firing squad at 6 p.m. Friday.
The last remaining way for Mahdi, 42, to avoid the death chamber would be for Gov. Henry McMaster to grant him clemency, which no governor in modern history has done. The U.S. Supreme Court declined his final appeal Friday morning.
Mahdi is one of 27 inmates remaining on death row. His execution is expected to be the last in a series of five executions that have taken place since September.
Executions in the state resumed after an unintended 13-year hiatus, caused in part by the state’s struggle to get the drugs it needed to carry out lethal injection executions. Legislators added firing squad as an option and made electrocution the default method in 2021, which condemned inmates unsuccessfully challenged in court.
Lethal injection is again an option after legislators expanded a secrecy law in 2023, allowing the state Department of Corrections to restock its supply. Three of the five inmates executed since September chose to die by lethal injection.
The first inmate in the state to die by firing squad was Brad Sigmon, whose execution took place March 7. Prior to that, no one had died by firing squad in the nation since the 2010 execution of Ronnie Lee Gardner in Utah. Mahdi’s execution would be the fifth carried out by firing squad since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed executions to resume nationwide in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Mahdi’s crime
On July 14, 2004, Mahdi stole a pistol, a set of license plates and a station wagon in his hometown of Lawrenceville, Virginia. He would later tell investigators he was fleeing the state after killing a person in a drug deal gone awry, a crime for which he was never convicted, according to court documents.
The next day, Mahdi stopped at an Exxon gas station in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to buy a beer. While gas station clerk Christopher Boggs, 29, checked Mahdi’s ID, Mahdi took out a gun and shot Boggs point-blank in the head, then reached over the counter to shoot him again where he lay on the floor.
Mahdi tried and failed to open the store cash register before taking off again, headed to South Carolina.
SC death row inmate’s attorneys ask court to halt execution over traumatic childhood

At around 3:30 a.m. on July 18, a driver stopped at the intersection of Bull Street and Washington Street in Columbia. The driver, Corey Pitts, looked down to find a CD in his car, then looked up to find a gun in his face, he later testified in court. Mahdi took Pitts’ red Ford Expedition, replaced its license plates with the ones on the stolen station wagon and drove off.
Not long after, Mahdi stopped at a Hess gas station in Calhoun County, where staff became suspicious as the gas pump rejected Mahdi’s credit cards. The gas station workers called the police, and Mahdi fled on foot.
He ran less than a mile before finding a shed, where he camped out for the rest of the day. At around 7 p.m., Capt. James Myers, 56, returned home and drove to his shed, where Mahdi was hiding. Mahdi shot Myers nine times with his own shotgun, then poured diesel fuel on his body and lit him on fire.
Mahdi took Myers’ police truck and fled. Police caught Mahdi in Satellite Beach, Florida, on July 21, 10 days after Myers first left Lawrenceville.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to killing Myers in court two years later, right after jury selection for his trial had ended. He later pleaded guilty to killing Boggs as well, for which he was sentenced to life in prison.
Usually, death sentences come from a jury’s recommendation. In Mahdi’s case, his death sentence was left entirely to Judge Clifton Newman.
“My challenge and my commitment throughout my judicial career have been to temper justice with mercy and to seek to find the humanity in every defendant that I sentence,” Newman said during Mahdi’s trial. “That sense of humanity seems not to exist in Mikal Deen Mahdi.”
Mikal Mahdi
Mahdi had a chaotic childhood, his attorneys argued in a last-ditch attempt to pause his execution.
Mahdi’s mother left when he was 4 years old, and his father told him it was because she had abandoned Mahdi and later died. Four years later, Mahdi watched his father kidnap his mother and try to kill her, his attorneys claimed in court filings.
Struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, Mahdi went to live with his aunt and uncle in Baltimore for several years before returning to Virginia at his father’s request, according to court documents.
“My life would’ve turned out completely different if I would’ve stayed in Baltimore,” Mahdi said in a video provided by his attorneys. “But that is a whole lot of could-a, would-a, should-a.”
Mahdi’s life was dotted with violent crimes to which prosecutors and judges have pointed in arguing he would not adapt well to prison life. Mahdi spent his teenage years, beginning at age 14, in juvenile detention centers for burglaries, vandalism and assault.
When Mahdi was 15, he and his father staged a nine-hour standoff with police who were trying to bring Mahdi to court for a sentencing hearing.

Several years later, when Mahdi was 18, he stabbed a maintenance worker in Richmond, Virginia, nearly to death. Mahdi spent three years in prison for that crime. About two months after his release, he embarked on the crime spree that would land him on death row, according to court documents.
During Mahdi’s trial, he smuggled a handmade key for his handcuffs into the courthouse in his mouth in an attempt to escape. In 2009, he and another inmate attacked a detention officer, who survived. His inmate record lists three attempted escapes since his 2006 sentence, along with a number of other infractions over the years.
Family members and former teachers recalled Mahdi as being “quiet, affectionate, thoughtful and creative,” his attorneys wrote in their appeal.
“I know there’s good in him,” Mahdi’s fifth grade teacher, Carol Wilson, said in a statement provided by his attorneys. “I saw it when he was a boy. If Mikal is allowed to live, I truly believe he can and will become a better person.”
In recent years, Mahdi has become an avid reader with a particular interest in learning about history, his attorneys said in a statement ahead of his execution. To honor his love of reading, anti-death penalty group South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty is accepting donations of books to donate to prisons and recently incarcerated people.
James Myers
Two days before Myers was killed, he went to Edisto Beach for a joint birthday celebration. His wife, his sister and his daughter were all born in July, so they spent the weekend together on the beach, his wife later testified in court.
When Myers and his wife, Amy Tripp Myers, returned home July 18, Myers went to visit his father. After Myers’ mother died, Myers made a daily habit of driving to his father’s house every morning to have coffee and chat, his father, Edward Myers, testified.
“I imagine he visited me a thousand times,” Edward Myers said.
That night, Myers and his father ate boiled peanuts and talked. James Myers left the house with a big smile on his face, his father testified.
His wife, Tripp Myers, realized several hours later when he hadn’t returned to their home in Orangeburg that something must be wrong. He had been on call that evening for the Orangeburg Public Safety Department, where he had worked for nearly 20 years, so she paged him, wondering if he had been sent to respond to a crime, she testified.
Tripp Myers often paged her husband of just over a year, she said. The two of them had developed a special code that she could send to mean, “I love you,” and she often did throughout the day.
This time, Myers didn’t respond. She called his work and learned no one had contacted him. She drove to the couple’s 37-acre farm in Calhoun County, looking for her husband.
Tripp Myers found his body. She started screaming and couldn’t stop, she testified during Mahdi’s trial.
SC Supreme Court declines to stop upcoming execution

“I knew that the man I loved was gone immediately and all of the dreams that we had would never be fulfilled,” Tripp Myers said at the time.
The shed where Myers was killed was the same place where the couple was married. The pond where Mahdi threw Myers’ fishing pole was the same pond where they camped out the night after buying the property. A few feet away from where Myers died, the couple had written their names in the concrete as it dried, she testified.
“I have yet to walk that once familiar ground between the pond and the shed without my heart tearing apart missing Jim and thinking about all of our unfulfilled dreams,” Tripp Myers testified. “We didn’t have enough time together.”
Myers’ daughter, Meredith Myers Firestone, was his “best buddy,” Firestone testified. The two enjoyed being outside, and Myers taught Firestone how to grow a garden, how to fish and hunt, and how to start a fire, she said.
The two of them would light fires in the fireplace at night and sit in silence, listening to the crackle of the fire and the ticking of the clock above the mantel, she said.
“We had some really special, special times when I was growing up,” Firestone testified.
Myers died about two years after his first grandchild was born. As a married mother, Firestone was reshaping the relationship she had with her father as an adult. She would call him to confide in him, and the two of them were becoming closer friends than ever, she said.
“He had wisdom just beyond his years, and he was so willing to give it to me, and it just took me a while to figure that out,” Firestone said. “And we were just getting ready to start a wonderful, wonderful relationship together as adults.”
Myers died before he could meet his second granddaughter, but she looked just like him, Firestone testified.

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)The Senate approved a bill that would tighten laws on acceptable forms of photo identification that can be used at West Virginia polling places.
The GOP-backed measure, House Bill 3016, is meant to address voter fraud and bolster secure elections. In a state with abysmal voter turnout, opponents of the bill worry it would make it harder for West Virginia residents, particularly older residents, to vote on Election Day.
The bill would require a photo ID — typically a driver’s license, passport or a resident identification card — to vote in-person. It would eliminate several current options accepted at polling places that can validate identity, including a Medicaid card and utility bill.
It passed the Senate on Friday with a vote of 32-2. 
Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, and Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion — the Senate’s two Democratic Senators — were the two no votes on the measure. 
The measure permits voters 65 and older to use an expired ID, including an expired driver’s license, as long as it was valid on their 65th birthday. Additionally, poll workers may allow a voter, whom the poll worker has known for at least six months, to vote without presenting a valid ID.
West Virginia residents can request a voter registration card with a photo free of charge from a county clerk’s office.
The House of Delegates approved the legislation on March 28.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House Appropriations Committee voted 22-1 Friday to issue a do-not-pass recommendation on a bill that would require school and public libraries to relocate books deemed “sexually explicit” to areas not easily accessible by minors.
The committee also rejected an amendment from the bill’s chief sponsor, Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, to exempt an online library database from the bill. Adding an age verification system to the online database was estimated to cost about $2 million over four years, adding a significant price tag to the legislation.
During discussion of the bill Friday, Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, said the amendment would create a glaring “loophole” that would allow minors to access the perceived explicit content even if other books were physically relocated.
Library content bill faces skepticism, criticism during North Dakota committee hearing

Rep. Brandy Pyle, R-Casselton, said the amendment would have been a “massive policy change” from the original version of the bill. She added the Appropriations Committee didn’t hold a full hearing on the possible changes with members of the public and other concerned stakeholders.
The bill also calls for state’s attorneys to investigate and prosecute violations, and for state funds to be withheld from schools or libraries that don’t comply.
Rep. David Richter, R-Williston, said he was concerned about added costs for state’s attorneys that were not included in the fiscal note but would impact local communities.
Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, said he feared the bill could be considered unconstitutional because the state could be in violation of its public education mandate for students if it withholds funding for schools that are out of compliance.
Rep. Mike Brandenburg, R-Edgeley, was the only committee member to support the bill. On Thursday he said voters in his district want lawmakers to take action on library content after a school did not remove a book that many found objectionable.
The bill will move to the House floor for a vote by the entire chamber. It previously was approved in the Senate and received a do-pass recommendation from the House Judiciary Committee.

If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,” Noem said.The Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank, estimates that between 2.2 million and 3.2 million immigrants will have to register. The registration requirement could be a powerful tool in the Trump administration’s efforts to carry out mass deportations.Registration requirementsDHS announced the new requirement in February. Under the rule, immigrants aged 14 and older who are required to register will need to carry registration documents at all times or risk potential prison terms or fines of up to $5,000.Immigrants covered by the requirement must submit fingerprints and other biometric and personal information through an online application handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Once an application is approved, the agency will provide documentation that immigrants must carry at all times.The suit, brought by immigration advocacy groups, argued the Trump administration violated proper rulemaking procedures in creating the application. The groups also warned in court documents that use of the application “will lead to racial profiling and the mistaken targeting of U.S. citizens.”The registration requirement is authorized under a wartime act known as the Alien Registration Act of 1940 that was first used in World War II.The requirement was rarely used until the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. During that time, any noncitizen males older than 16 who hailed from 25 Muslim-majority countries had to register with the U.S. government.The program, the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, led to no terrorism convictions and was dissolved in 2016.Under the requirement in place Friday, those who are required to register include immigrants who entered the U.S. without legal authority and Canadian visitors in the U.S. for more than 30 days.Those who do not have to register include lawful permanent residents, immigrants with work visas or certain other visas and those in removal proceedings.",,,,2025-04-11 12:21:21.706345

In a brief outlining his opposition to Riggs’ request for Supreme Court review, Griffin asked the high court to let the 2-1 ruling issued in his favor by a panel of Court of Appeals judges last Friday to stand so that the process the panel ordered — under which thousands of voters would need to come forward in short order to prove the validity of their registration documents — can commence.
In the brief, Griffin — who has been challenging the outcome of the election in a series of actions since last fall — states, “This litigation has drawn on long enough. The cure process, rather than more courthouse battles, is the pathway for restoring integrity in this election. It is now time to bring the litigation to a close and let the cure process run its course.”
On Monday of this week, in response to Riggs’ request for review, the Supreme Court temporarily stayed the Court of Appeals order. It’s long been widely expected in political and legal circles that the high court would ultimately be forced to issue a ruling in the case – though a return to federal court remains a possibility as well.
On Thursday of this week, national and state Democratic Party leaders held a press conference to denounce Griffin’s efforts to reverse the election results in which Riggs holds a 734-vote lead — a lead that was confirmed in two recounts. “What’s happening in North Carolina goes beyond state borders,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told reporters. “If Republicans are successful in changing the rules post-election and throwing away valid votes, this will have broad implications, serious repercussions, on elections across the country for years to come.”
Republicans hold a 5-2 majority on the high court – a gap that increases to 5-1 in the Riggs-Griffin dispute, given that Riggs has recused herself from the matter. Three of the Republican justices, in previous decisions in the case, have expressed support for Griffin’s positions. In the case of a 3-3 tie in the Supreme Court — either on the motion for discretionary review or in a final ruling on the merits of the case — the Appeals Court decision would stand.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/StateSupremeCourt_Photo-nccourts.gov_.jpg,,,2025-04-11 12:21:21.706345

Democracy does,Stephanie Thomas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/11/cts-election-system-doesnt-need-to-be-saved-democracy-does/,"It is not often I find myself aligned with Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. But this week, we found rare common ground on the subject of U.S. elections.","As an elected Democrat, it is not often I find myself aligned with Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. This week, however, we found rare common ground on the subject of U.S. elections. 
On Tuesday, I testified in Washington, D.C., before the congressional Subcommittee on Elections, where in addition to sharing the process Connecticut undertook to successfully implement Early Voting in 2024, I implored House members on the Committee to leave the authority to run elections to states. 

Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas
 Sen. McConnell told the  Wall Street Journal   that even though elections have national consequences, “the power to conduct them rests in state capitols. No public mandate, real or perceived, lets Washington tamper with this authority. 
 I couldn’t agree more. Centralized control of elections by the federal government would impose a one-size-fits-all policy that would actively undermine, rather the support, the ballot box access and security states like Connecticut provide. 
 There are currently two federal items that should be of interest to every Connecticut resident: 

 The SAVE Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, April 10.
 The “Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections” executive order issued by the President last month and due to take effect on April 26. 

 Both the SAVE Act and the executive order would be bad for Connecticut, bad for voters, and bad for taxpayers. 
 And as your Secretary of the State, it is important for me to explain why. 
 On paper, the measures sound simple enough. Both require producing documents that prove citizenship before voting in person, penalties for getting it wrong, and use of federal databases to aid in verification, among other measures.  But unfortunately, it is not that easy. 
 In Connecticut, only a handful of towns have full-time registrars of voters, so it is hard to imagine how towns will staff in-person voter registration. Over 30 percent of our current registrations come through the DMV, and even more through the mail, but these would be eradicated. No more registration drives on college campuses or making an address change the same time you visit the DMV. Every registration and change would require you to prove your citizenship status. 
 Your local election worker would also need to become an expert and trained in verifying documents. Passports and birth certificates sound fairly easy, but what about marriage licenses, divorce papers, adoption papers, and the plethora of other documents that may need to be produced to prove your identity? And yes, it’s confusing because the executive order doesn’t actually say that a birth certificate is valid evidence of citizenship, because that would conflict with the January executive order about birthright citizenship. And no, you cannot use the REAL ID you just spent so much effort to procure. 
 Starting to get the gist about the complexity? Similar laws in other states have led to a plethora of issues: mistakenly blocking people who were later proven to be citizens; a woman married three times, who had long ago lost the divorce papers from her first marriage, and was unable to vote because of it; an elderly parent moving into a nursing home and unable to locate their birth certificate; a military member overseas and suddenly unable to use their military ID as proof. 
 Our election workforce would also need to become proficient in several federal databases. In addition to the data privacy issue of EVERY local election worker around the country having access to the SAVE database, the Social Security Death Index, and “any federal database” needed, we have the practical consideration that many of these databases only allow for one-by-one lookups, utilizing information that election workers don’t always have. Training in usage and staff time for the look-ups are a real cost to towns. 
 According to the SAVE Act, access to the databases is to be provided for free “within available appropriations.” Anyone who has been around legislative circles knows that is code for zero funding is coming. Towns would be required to pay the federal government for access to these databases — a cost most municipalities cannot afford — and for election workers who may inadvertently make a mistake in approving a voter, there is the threat of stiff penalties, including jail time. 
 States are being provided 30 days to make these changes and more. We cannot ask Connecticut’s hardworking, committed registrars of voters to take on these responsibilities without training, funds, extra staff, or any of the many other resources they would need to begin doing all these new processes  immediately   Not to mention the chilling effect it will have on retention. The last thing we need is to lose experienced election workers who would rather leave the job they love than face the threat of jail for an honest mistake.  Who among us never makes a mistake? 
 Ultimately, the costs would be borne by voters, Connecticut towns, and you, Connecticut taxpayers. 
Good legislative policies solve problems without creating new, worse ones. They also provide the time and resources needed to make the new laws work. This is not the case with either the SAVE Act or executive order. We must prioritize American citizens in our election policy instead of making millions of voters jump through complicated hoops to prevent the infinitesimal number of possible non-citizens from voting.
I will never tell you how to think, but to stop and think and read documents yourself, instead of relying on social media and headlines.
 This is democracy, and we must use civic engagement to defend it. The most important part of being civically engaged is being informed. You may find the SAVE Act here.  and the executive order here.

He is also a chaotic, destructive, and unelected force in our federal government. Yet he has become my pen pal, if one sided. How on earth did this happen? 
In this current political climate, many people I know have felt frightened and helpless. But my friend Lucy Moore, a Santa Fe writer and mediator, took a creative as well as entertainingly sarcastic approach. She says “Elon Musk was my nemesis, torturing me day and night. I had to do something, and so I wrote him a letter…As Elon Musk asked federal employees to list 5 things they did to justify themselves I wrote him thanking him for the brilliant idea to write down 5 great things I did this week.”
I was immediately inspired. Lucy tends to send a postcard, but my hand writing is illegible and I am going on a bit more, so mine is typed. I like to mix obvious actions like philanthropy and calling representatives with a more personal take. At first my notes to Elon were pretty straightforward.
Dear Elon Musk,
Thanks so much for the opportunity to share 5 things I did last week. I appreciate your interest. Here goes:

 I participated in the 2/28 buy nothing boycott.
 I gave $ to Girls Inc. to support empowering young women.
 I gave $ to New Mexico Coalition Against Homelessness as the HUD grants are vanishing.
 I took visitors to the Indian Arts and Culture on Museum Hill in Santa Fe, to emphasize diversity. 
 I’m celebrating Mardi Gras because carnival is always about the power of the people. 

There is more, but these were highlights. Have a nice day. I look forward to checking in next week.
Yours,
Miriam Sagan
But I did not want Elon to get bored, so I started varying things. I’m also sharing things I am refraining from. These include what I am NOT doing:
“Building a case against the situation in Washington, DC. The problems are obvious.
Bemoaning that ‘no one is doing anything.’ We’re doing plenty. 
Becoming depressed or terrified. Cui bono?
Feeling I have to come up with the perfect action. That is, not exaggerating my own importance. ( know you’ll agree this isn’t always that easy). 
Have a nice day!”
As I write Elon each week, I feel motivated to keep doing the things I care about. I’ve always loved To Do lists and systems as to how to get through my day. This is a natural add-on. As Lucy says: “You actually do 5 resistance things each week, which is better than wishing you had done something and crawling back under the bed.”
And it has been a fascinating literary exercise. After all, numerous novels are “epistolary”—written in the form of letters, most often by one character without a reply. Often a personal diary is written to an invisible but ideal reader, as in “Dear Diary.” As I look at the accumulating letters, I see a record of my own life as well as of the larger socio-political sphere. It helps to have an audience and a listener—even if it is Elon Musk. 
Both therapeutic and micro-activism, writing Elon Musk is fun. Lucy Moore has seen more people join in and write, a group who are doing good deeds and writing “5-things-I-did” postcards weekly.  
All are welcome to join. You can see Lucy Moore’s letters and cards at  https://lucymoore.com/category/blog/ or on her Facebook, substack and bluesky pages, where you can post your own.

Will Carpenter, an El Dorado Republican, sits at his desk during an April 10, 2025, session of the House. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A major health insurance company lost out on a bid to continue its role as one of Kansas’ Medicaid providers, and the state Legislature passed a law to avoid a repeat.
Aetna Better Health of Kansas embroiled itself last year in legal battles with the state arguing the selection process for providers of the $4 billion Medicaid program was flawed. Legislators similarly criticized the executive branch for a lack of transparency. One Republican said the ordeal would be a “stain” on Kansas’ contract processes for years to come.
Aetna provided health coverage as a managed care organization under KanCare, as Medicaid is known in Kansas, for five years leading up to the state’s 2024 evaluation process. The company tied for third place with another private health insurance company and ultimately lost the bid. In August, Aetna asked a legislative committee to consider changing the rules for MCO selection as it was going through an appeals process, which it lost.
House Bill 2284, which Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed April 4 and the Legislature revived Thursday, forces the executive branch to create policies addressing some issues Aetna litigated. Republicans, who overrode the veto, say the bill improves transparency.
But the governor in her veto message said the bill is a “dramatic overreach” into the authority of the executive and judicial branches.
“Most alarmingly, this bill creates a haphazard procurement process that does nothing to mitigate conflicts of interest among legislators and creates an environment that is rife for exploitation and graft — exactly the opposite of what the existing process, overseen by the Department of Administration, is designed to do,” Kelly said.
She said the bill risked creating “legal, ethical and constitutional challenges.”
In the Senate, the override passed Thursday without debate in a 30-10 vote with Sen. Tim Shallenburger, a Baxter Springs Republican, joining Democrats in opposition. The House completed the veto with an 88-37 vote along party lines.
“It’s a good bill. Vote for it,” said Rep. Will Carpenter, an El Dorado Republican.
That was the extent of House Republicans’ remarks on the bill in their effort to overturn the veto.
Kelly said she would have supported the bill in its original form.
“As amended, this bill is now unworkable and opens the state up to costly and protracted litigation,” she said.
During the 2024 contract bidding process, Aetna and Healthy Blue, a Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliate, earned the same score, warranting a tiebreaker. However, state officials destroyed documentation of evaluators’ scoring notes that informed the selection of Healthy Blue over Aetna.
Aetna appealed the state’s decision to pick Healthy Blue. The decision, which came from the Department of Administration, eventually was upheld in Shawnee County District Court. Aetna also sued state agencies for destroying the scoring records, and was unsuccessful.
  Sen. David Haley, a Kansas City Democrat, flip-flopped on the MCO legislation in deference to Gov. Laura Kelly. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Sen. David Haley, a Kansas City Democrat, refrained from voting on the veto override at first, but after being required to cast a vote under Senate rules, he voted to sustain the governor’s veto. He said he supported the bill in its original form but deferred to the governor’s opinion.
“I think it’s good to have procedures in place when we look at our MCOs,” Haley said. “However I greatly respect the overarching view that the governor can give to these measures and her vetting this and finding it to be something that should be reconsidered. I won’t lean on my own judgement, my own opinion.”
In its original form, the bill contained three provisions regulating the MCO bidding and selection process. It required the executive branch to create policies that prohibit the destruction of records covered under the Kansas Open Records Act, adopt tiebreaking procedures and “to be transparent with the Legislature during each step of the procurement process to the fullest extent permitted by state law.”
Later, lawmakers added a fourth provision requiring a new appeals process. Currently aggrieved bidders go through judicial review. Under the new law, an appeals committee made up of legislative leadership — and headed by the senate president — will take up review.
Rep. Susan Wikle, a Lawrence Democrat, said her primary issue with the bill was the modification of the appeals process. Democrats initially were left out of the newly established legislative panel but were later included, Wikle said.
She said she had unanswered questions about the interplay between the existing judicial review process and the new panel’s function, but after she found answers, she reached the conclusion that the bill was an “overreach.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100546-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-11 12:21:21.706345

House Bill 2426 would allow some chasers to be classified as “professional severe weather trackers.” For a small fee, they could act as “emergency vehicles” and do things like subvert road closures and run red lights. 
Bill author Rep. Scott Fettgater, R-Okmulgee, said in a press release Thursday that he and Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, would be hosting an interim study on the subject and that “many misunderstood the intent of the legislation.” Mann filed a similar bill in the state Senate.
Critics of the bill, including many well-known storm chasers, expressed concern that it would  overregulate the industry and define who is considered a “professional” storm chaser. 
“This was not to stop or disrupting any storm chaser that currently comes to Oklahoma to help residents stay aware of dangerous weather,” Fetgatter said in a statement. “Our interim study will help continue this conversation and determine the path of the legislation going forward. I believe the proper role of government is public safety, and this is a necessary discussion.”
He said he hopes people from all sides of the issue will come together after the legislative session to dig deeper into the details of the bill’s concept. 
The bill had cleared the House and was referred to a Senate committee for consideration.

The detention center is owned and operated by private company CoreCivic. (Photo via Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
Despite profiling concerns, more law agencies are joining street-level immigration enforcement

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.



They’re incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators considered a similar bill that would prohibit state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants, but it did not make it through to a final vote.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
Private detention oversight
Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
Trump’s mass deportation plan could rely on state cooperation

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
Troubling conditions
Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

A[...]","One of the entrances to the Federal Trade Commission Building in Washington, DC, that serves as the headquarters of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  (Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Two Democratic appointees to the Federal Trade Commission are raising the alarm: A group controlled by the world’s richest man might be accessing a trove of confidential business records — including those of his competitors.
The commission is tasked with stopping anticompetitive business practices, especially those that harm consumers and small businesses. After making several statements that seemed supportive of its work, President Donald Trump’s recent actions seem to tell a different story.
Trump in March attempted to remove commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, both of whom were appointed by Democrats. They both say Trump exceeded his powers and are suing to end the attempt. But their uncertain status has slowed or stymied the commission’s efforts against pharmacy middlemen and in other areas.
In a joint statement Thursday, Slaughter and Bedoya raised concerns that members of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” had arrived at the FTC, looking to see whom to fire there. The commissioners worried that Musk’s people would access business secrets that the law requires be kept confidential.
“This threatens the basic functions of the FTC and the markets it protects,” Slaughter and Bedoya said in a written statement. “The FTC collects and retains extremely sensitive and confidential business data. This data can move markets. It can certainly change the competitive dynamics in any industry.”
Musk famously bought the social media platform known as Twitter and changed its name to X. The FTC has been examining such platforms’ practices, as well as those of other tech giants. So it likely has a storehouse of secret information regarding Musk’s companies and those of his competitors.
“Under no circumstances should DOGE be able to access this data,” Bedoya and Slaughter said. “We are deeply concerned that they may do it anyway. These are the legal requirements that the Chairman is bound to respect and the questions that he needs to answer to assure the public, and those the Commission regulates, that the extraordinarily sensitive data the FTC possesses is being safeguarded as required by law.”
Asked for comment, the office of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson didn’t immediately respond Thursday. But the news organization Reuters quoted FTC spokesman Joe Simonson as saying Ferguson “supports the president’s agenda to cut out waste fraud and abuse in the federal government.”
Bedoya and Slaughter said allowing Musk’s subordinates access FTC files is rife with potential conflicts.
“We understand that DOGE representatives have been onboarded to the FTC as staffers of the Commission, rather than non-staff visitors,” the commissioners wrote. “While this may be an attempt to mitigate the risks posed by DOGE review of the FTC, those risks remain substantial, because they are coming from an arm of the executive branch not authorized by Congress and already known to be full of active market participants. Even if these DOGE-FTC employees focus primarily on contracts and vendor relationships rather than particular case files, they may still access substantial non-public data. For example, our contracts for expert witness testimony necessarily reveal information about ongoing, nonpublic law enforcement investigations.”

Russell said Congress must step up to prevent the uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets caused by President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policy, which has been imposed using emergency powers granted by Congress.
“Congress can act,” he said on a media call with other Democratic state financial officers on Thursday.
“They have the ability to act right now to actually prevent these tariff policies from being implemented. As well as stopping many of the other policies that have rolled out over the last two and half months,” Russell said.
Lawmakers in Congress have a constitutional right to take charge of tariff authority, said Michael Frerichs, the Illinois state treasurer.
“But right now, you are cowering, letting him go on this reckless spree. As a result, a lot of Americans are scared and are losing a lot of money. It’s time for you to step up and take the reins back,” Frerichs said.
Seven Republican U.S. senators have signed onto a bipartisan bill that would give lawmakers a say over tariffs.

Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer. Minnesota Senate Republicans filed an ethics complaint against Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, arguing that he used his elected position to steer funding for his legal client.
The Reformer first reported last week that Champion, a practicing attorney, had advocated for millions in grants for a nonprofit headed up by one of his legal clients, the Rev. Jerry McAfee.
Champion says his pro-bono legal work for McAfee concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session, when he successfully steered $3 million in public funds to McAfee’s violence prevention group 21 Days of Peace.
Earlier this month, Champion introduced another bill allocating $1 million to 21 Days of Peace. Champion did not disclose to his fellow senators that he had represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties.
Senate Republicans in their ethics complaint argued that Champion’s failure to disclose his relationship with McAfee “violated Senate Rules by falling short of the highest ethical standards, betraying the public trust, and giving the appearance that his independence of judgement was impaired by his legal relationship with Rev. McAfee and Salem Inc.”
“This is a clear and deeply troubling case of a public official using their legislative position to potentially benefit their private legal clients,” Sen. Michael Kreun, R-Blaine, said in a statement. “With what we know, at a minimum this is a conflict of interest that warranted disclosure. At worst, it’s an abuse of public office for personal and professional gain.”
Champion earlier this week told the Senate Jobs and Economic Development Committee that the reporting about his connection with McAfee and the grant funding he steered to the nonprofit was a “smear” on his name.
Champion has temporarily stepped down as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Ethics, and he has asked the committee to issue an advisory opinion on whether his actions on behalf of McAfee’s group represented a conflict of interest and should have been disclosed under Senate rules.
“There’s no conflict from my vantage point,” Champion told the Senate jobs committee.
 McAfee isn’t the only legal client to benefit from Champion’s grantmaking: In 2024, he provided legal representation for a Minneapolis-based substance abuse treatment provider, Turning Point. The prior year, Champion spearheaded a successful effort to direct $1 million in public funds to the organization for improving their facility.
Champion said he was not compensated for his legal representation of Turning Point, and he was involved in the case only briefly.
The Star Tribune reported that Champion’s executive assistant, Shemeka Bogan, previously worked for McAfee’s 21 Days of Peace. Champion and Bogan both previously worked for the nonprofit Stairstep Foundation, and Champion in his Senate role has advocated for public funding for Stairstep.
Champion’s ethically questionable conduct underscores the perils of Minnesota’s part-time Legislature when most lawmakers need to earn a living beyond their $51,750 legislative salary, and how lawmaker-directed grants create an ethics minefield. Some lawmakers are now seeking to curtail the practice of lawmakers giving public funds directly to nonprofits.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NN230324_240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 12:21:21.706345

The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
 ‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’

Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.
Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-11 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How much new housing would your CT town need under ‘fair share’?,Renata Daou and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/11/ct-fair-share-housing-by-town/,A recent study looked at three different methods of allocating housing needs from regions to municipalities in Connecticut. Here's what it found.,"For years, Connecticut lawmakers have debated a policy that would have towns plan and zone for a set number of units based on regional housing needs, and a new report shows exactly how many units each town would have to plan for under the policy.
In 2023, the legislature passed a law that mandated the “fair share” study, and the state contracted with consulting firm ECONorthwest. The firm released town-specific numbers earlier this month.
The need for new housing across Connecticut ranges from 120,000 to 380,000 housing units, and ECONorthwest found that the state has the most constrained housing market in the nation. 
The study looks at three different methods of allocating housing needs from regions to municipalities in Connecticut. 
In the “baseline” approach, there is an estimated need of 133,136 units. For the two other approaches, A and B, there is an estimated need of 120,000 units, according to the Draft Fair Share Allocation Results. The three studies take different variables into consideration to allocate housing.
Under a bill working its way through the legislature this year, towns’ affordable housing plans would have to describe how they would plan and zone for the number of units assigned by the state. 
It’s not yet clear which of the three methodologies the proposed law would require the legislature to use to decide how many units towns would have to plan and zone for.
Supporters say the legislation would require towns that have been reluctant to allow affordable housing to take action — and that it would encourage more housing density, which would help reduce dependence on cars.
The proposal has been controversial. Local officials and groups that represent towns say it would be burdensome on localities, reduce local control and doesn’t take into account the needs of individual municipalities.
The baseline approach excludes high-poverty towns from having to plan for more housing units and caps any town’s allocation at 20% of the existing number of units. It excludes high-poverty cities like Hartford, Waterbury, New Haven, Bridgeport and Windham from having to zone for any additional affordable housing units and sets their allocation to zero.
The approach aims to keep from concentrating poverty. Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, said in an interview that these towns also already have the zoning in place to allow more housing to be built.
The baseline approach also uses four equally weighted variables: property value share, income disparity, poverty rate and multifamily housing share. It also focuses on housing that’s set aside for households earning less than 80% of the area median income. Under the baseline plan, the total units allocated (117,234) is under the estimated need (133,136) because of the 20% cap. 
Approach A is the same as the baseline approach but includes all towns and removes the cap. Approach B allocates based on housing affordability gap for low-income renters, recent housing production and access to jobs.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The Republican-led House of Delegates approved $97 million in funding for the Hope Scholarship, but not before numerous lawmakers rose to question the rapidly increasing price tag of the state’s education voucher program.
“We are leaving other vitally necessary programs underfunded because of an increase in this line item,” said Del. Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, who noted the state’s public employee’s insurance program, which insures teachers, continues to struggle. 
The Hope Scholarship launched four years ago. It provides roughly $4,900 per student to be used for private schooling, homeschooling, microschools and more.
Lawmakers on Thursday approved House Bill 3356, which proposes taking $28 million from the state’s general revenue fund surplus, along with HB 3357 to take $33.8 million from the lottery fund surplus. 
Legislators approved additional funds totaling $97 million when members approved a negotiated fiscal year 2026 budget later that night. 
State Treasurer Larry Pack, who oversees the program, requested around $100 million to pay for likely 19,000 students using the program next year. 
It’s a jump from this year’s $58 million in funding for the program. 
In 2027, its price tag is expected to skyrocket to around $300 million, when the program will open up to all students in the state. It was the largest funding increase requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey in his first budget proposal.
  Del. Dana Ferrell, R-Kanawha
“I’m going to vote no on this. My concerns aren’t about school choice, it’s about fiscal conservatism,” said Del. Dana Ferrell, R-Kanawha, saying that emergency medical services and road repairs are going underfunded. “Yet, we have a line item that just continues to expand.”
West Virginia’s Hope Scholarship is one of the nation’s broadest education voucher programs, with limited guardrails on how the money can be spent. During the 2023-24 school year, families using the program spent $22 million on things like private school tuition, piano lessons, dance studio fees, iPads and water tables. More than $122,000 was used at out of state schools last school year.
  Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock
House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, stressed that lawmakers’ negotiated FY 2026 budget, which they’re required to pass by Saturday, is fiscally responsible and balanced with surplus dollars included. The Hope Scholarship is a priority, he said. 
“More importantly, this supplemental represents a commitment that we made to students all across this state who chose where they want to go school and whose parents choose where they want to go to school,” McGeehan said. 
  Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam
Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, said that federal and county money designated per student remains with the school district even if a child opts to use the Hope Scholarship.
“We have thousands of parents now utilizing this. They have wanted better educational outcomes for their children and they are finding that with this Hope Scholarship,” she said.
In the 2023-2024 school year, 5,443 students used the Hope Scholarship. Most of the money was spent at in-state, private (usually religious) schools. 
No student in McDowell County, the state’s poorest county, used the program last school year or during the 2022-23 school year.
“The program doesn’t do enough in reaching our children who need it the most,” said House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell.
  W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
He said the program’s expansion is negatively impacting public schools because they’re losing per pupil funding. School finances are in trouble due to waning pandemic funds and student population loss, which includes students leaving for the Hope Scholarship. Counties this year have proposed or been approved to close 25 schools
“Every time a student leaves it is hurting our local schools,” he said. 
Democratic lawmakers in the House proposed a bill banning the use of Hope Scholarship funds at out-of-state schools, but the measure wasn’t taken up for consideration this legislative session. 
  Del. Bill Anderson, R-Wood
Del. Bill Anderson, R-Wood, warned that this is an “ever-increasing budget item.”
“We need to begin to seriously consider its impact on our overall budget,” he said. We’re going to have to face a serious consideration of this issue in the future.”

Lawmakers fund the Hope Scholarship so that it could cover every eligible student in the state; not all of the funds may end up being used.
House Finance Chairman Vernon Criss, R-Wood, said that lawmakers would likely have to put some parameters on the Hope Scholarship in an effort to get its accelerating price tag under control. 
The Senate will have to approve the House’s supplemental appropriations for the Hope Scholarship. The session adjourns Saturday.

They are commitments. They’re the promises we make to our children, to our neighbors and to ourselves. And now, more than ever, we must live up to them.
Every single day, often without recognition, public health professionals across our state and nation are working to keep us safe. They make sure the water flowing from our taps is clean. That the air we breathe is safe. That the food on our tables won’t make our families sick. Their work is quiet, often invisible — but it is absolutely essential.
And yet, this vital system is under attack.

What the reaction to a tragic shooting tells us about health care
Let’s rethink abortion politics that punish patients and doctors



The recent layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, combined with ongoing threats to eliminate life-saving grants and delay critical services, are more than just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s dismantling our first line of defense. These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They’re the people who ensure vaccines reach our communities, prevent disease outbreaks, and help us weather crises with strength and resilience. Here in South Dakota, we will feel the impact. When federal support is gutted, it means fewer resources to prevent disease, less capacity to respond to emergencies and more South Dakotans left behind.
And this is just the beginning. Looming on the horizon are deeper cuts — cuts that would tear at the very fabric of our public health safety net. Congress will decide whether to cut basic needs like health care and food. The ripple effects of those cuts will be felt in rural community grocery stores and across health care systems, two anchors keeping our communities alive and vibrant. These cuts threaten not only individual well-being but the strength of our workforce, the stability of our economy and the security of our communities.
Because here’s the truth: Public health is not just about preventing illness. It’s about building a society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. When one person is sick, struggling or unable to work, we all feel the ripple effects. Public health is the quiet force that keeps us connected, protected and strong.
And when it’s working well, you barely notice it. That’s the paradox. The fewer headlines we make, the better we’re doing. But that quiet success has come at a cost — we’ve failed to tell our story. We haven’t always shown the true value of our work. That’s on us. And we’re ready to do better.
As someone who has spent nearly two decades in this field, I can no longer stay silent. I’m raising the alarm, but I’m also raising a call to action. We must stand together to protect and strengthen our public health systems — not just for the crises we can see, but for the ones we don’t yet know are coming.
Because a nation that can’t protect its health cannot protect its future. But together, with courage and commitment, we can choose a better path. Let’s build it — together.

CHICAGO — By the time FBI agents came knocking at Omar Maani’s door on a January morning in 2018, the red-light camera entrepreneur had spent at least the last decade and a half getting ahead in business by bribing public officials.

Maani, who quickly agreed to become a cooperating witness, told a federal jury this week that he’d been doing business that way since he was “in my early 20s.” And as an FBI mole, the feds needed Maani to keep it up as he secretly recorded “dozens and dozens and dozens” of people over the next 18 months.

It wasn’t until the tail end of his cooperation that Maani’s undercover camera turned to State Sen. Emil Jones III. At the time in mid-2019, the Chicago Democrat had recently marked 10 years in the General Assembly as a relative “backbencher” in Springfield parlance — the inverse of his high-profile father, former Senate President Emil Jones Jr.

Even Jones was surprised to learn that legislation he’d filed for the past few years calling for statewide audits and studies of red-light camera systems kept Maani up at night, joking to his dinner companion at a suburban steakhouse: “Really? Little old me? Come on.” But Maani explained that he felt those studies could easily be misconstrued, leading to bans that would hurt his industry and his livelihood as the co-founder of Chicago-based red-light camera company SafeSpeed.

After cajoling Jones to come up with a fundraising goal for Maani — usually an easy sell for those Maani was used to bribing — the senator instead asked for something surprising.

""But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones said, digging into his wagyu filet at Steak 48 during a dinner with Maani in July 2019. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part time job.”

After watching back that portion of the secretly recorded dinner in a Chicago federal courtroom Thursday, Maani told the jury that Jones’ request to hire his intern, Christopher Katz, “caught me off guard a little bit.” But at the FBI’s direction, Maani went with it, eventually hiring Katz for $15 an hour in August 2019, even though he never received any work assignments for the 20-hour-per-week gig.

Katz ended up getting paid $1,800 directly from Maani and his real estate development company, Persidio Capital. And Jones never ended up receiving the $5,000 campaign contribution Maani had promised.

But those dual agreements — and allegedly lying to the FBI about them — form the basis of the feds’ 2022 charges against Jones that the lawmaker is fighting in court this week.

Former intern to testify

Maani left the witness stand Thursday afternoon after two days of testimony in Jones’ trial. Katz is expected to testify beginning Friday morning, followed by three FBI agents who worked on the case. The senator’s legal team has so far promised two witnesses before closing arguments likely to begin early next week. Jones has not yet said whether he’ll testify.

Even if Jones doesn’t take the stand, the jury has gotten plenty of facetime with him via the grainy video from Maani’s hidden FBI camera, which captured a big group meeting that included Jones in April 2019, along with three dinners that summer.

It was at the second dinner that Jones told Maani: “If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good.” Maani in turn explained that they needed to find “a creative way” for Jones to accept the money so the contribution wouldn’t show up in the senator’s public campaign finance reports.

“I don’t want it to look funky, you know, that our company is cutting you a check or I’m personally cutting you a check,” Maani said. “And then somebody asks some questions or whatever about it.”

On the witness stand Thursday, Maani explained he was especially nervous about the media following a trail of campaign contributions back to SafeSpeed, having already been the subject of unflattering reporting by the Chicago Tribune in 2017. So he suggested that maybe he could pay directly for a portion of Jones’ upcoming campaign fundraiser at a Chicago White Sox game.

“I could just, whatever, you know, cut a check to them or however we do it,” Maani said, to which Jones replied, “OK.”

“The number’s fine,” Maani continued. “Whatever the number is, the number is. I just don’t want it to look goofy.”

Jones laughed, agreeing when Maani asked him to “keep it quiet, is that cool?”

“The main thing: Take care of my intern,” Jones said. “That’s it.”

Maani agreed before Jones turned the conversation to his bill, which Maani had already asked him to limit from a statewide study to only the city of Chicago, where SafeSpeed didn’t operate. Before they moved on to talking about the restaurant’s famed corn creme brûlée, Jones’ pilot license training and travel plans, Maani reiterated that he’d “take care of” the senator’s intern if Jones would limit his legislation.

But Jones raised Maani’s commitment, promising to “protect you all from McSweeney,” a reference to then-Republican State Rep. David McSweeney, R-Barrington Hills, with whom Jones had formed an odd alliance based on their mutual distrust of red-light cameras.

Jones’ lawyers on Thursday went after Maani’s credibility during cross-examination, zeroing in on his years of bribery — and the fact that the deal he cut with the government allowed him to both keep his earnings from SafeSpeed and stay out of prison. Maani’s singular conspiracy bribery charge was dismissed in 2023, and Maani emphasized that his testimony during Jones’ trial was not subject to any cooperation agreement with the government, but a run-of-the-mill subpoena.

Defense attorney Joshua Adams asked Maani about a time when he allegedly paid off a former suburban mayor who pleaded guilty to red-light camera-related charges using a check stolen from his own mother.

Maani balked at the line of questioning after several minutes, telling Adams he wanted to “make something very clear.”

“I never voluntarily just decided to give them money,” Maani said of the elected officials he bribed. “They always asked me for money. They asked me for money and I capitulated and I agreed to give it to them after they asked me.”

But Jones, Adams pointed out, was different.

As the senator sat down for a third dinner with Maani in August 2019, Adams noted the senator was excitedly telling him about the flying lesson he’d just come from, which made him a bit late to their meeting.

“Did he show up asking for $5,000?” Adams asked, to which Maani said “no.”

“After this dinner, how many times did Mr. Jones call you asking about the $5,000?” Adams asked Maani.

“He did not,” Maani replied.

“How many times did he text you asking about the $5,000?” Adams asked.

“He did not,” Maani said again.

(Photo courtesy of Bernalillo County)When New Mexicans call 911 in an emergency, the first question dispatchers ask is where the caller is located. Under a new statewide emergency dispatch system expected to launch in August and funded by a newly signed law, dispatchers won’t have to rely on the caller and instead will be able to track the cell phone’s location data.
Later on, perhaps in 2026, the broadband internet powering the new 911 system is expected to allow callers to send and receive text messages from dispatchers, and share photos, live streams, videos and surveillance camera footage to help responders better understand the scene of an emergency before they get there.
Bernalillo County in Central New Mexico announced Thursday that state officials have selected its Emergency Communications Department in Albuquerque as the beta site for a new call handling software that will move 911 calls away from the old wired- and radio-based network to a new one that will run through the internet.
The new system, five years in the making, is called Next Generation 911. The public won’t immediately notice a difference and will still have to dial 911 to receive help, but officials expect the more precise location data to result in faster emergency response times.
It isn’t just an upgrade in technology but will require a “cultural shift,” Bernalillo County Emergency Communications Director Robbie McCormick told Source NM in a phone interview on Thursday.
“With any kind of advancement, it’s work, but it’s a blessing. It’s a good thing and it’s change, but we will have to take it one step at a time,” McCormick said. “I know that it can help many, many people having this type of technology.”
If someone is a victim of domestic violence, for example, it would be more safe to text a dispatcher instead of call them, McCormick said. It could also prove helpful for someone who is injured in such a way that they cannot speak, she said.
Sometime further in the future, the live stream and video features could help first responders better understand a wildfire’s intensity and direction, McCormick said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stephen Weinkauf, NM 911 bureau chief at the state Department of Finance and Administration’s Local Government Division, told Source NM on Thursday that every dispatch center in the state will transition to the new system over the next three months, starting with Valencia, Guadalupe and De Baca counties.
He said once the entire state is plugged in, dispatchers will be able to reroute a 911 call anywhere in the state.
“The end goal of NextGen911 is to provide a more accurate 911 call-routing, and a more reliable 911 network to ensure that we can increase the level of data and situational awareness to the 911 center and then out to the first responder,” Weinkauf said. “This will reduce the level of call transfers, and our end goal is to reduce response times.”
Next Generation 911 will be able to reach all 46 emergency dispatch centers across the state because of an increase in the 911 surcharge already paid by New Mexicans who use cell phones and landlines.
Customers pay $0.51 per line per month to the telecommunications companies, who then pass that money on to the government. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday signed Senate Bill 535, a package of bills that includes an increase to the 911 surcharge to $1 per line per month, which will raise more than $13 million in the next year and even more money in future years, according to legislative analysts.
Cecilia Mavrommatis, Local Government Division director for the state Department of Finance and Administration, told Source NM on Thursday that the increased surcharge will make 911 services more equitable statewide.
“I think we’re more prepared now, after this legislative session,” Mavromattis said. “We’re talking about a direct impact on people’s lives. This is going to save a life somewhere, at some point.”
988 hotline
SB535 also makes a series of changes to state laws governing the 988 Lifeline; workers’ compensation; the Public Regulation Commission; and autonomy for New Mexicans with disabilities and older adults.
It increases the telecommunications relay service surcharge for phone calls to other states, from 0.33% to 1.66%, which will help pay for the 988 Lifeline.
“This investment in 988 is an investment in saving lives,” Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement on Monday. “Every New Mexican should have access to compassionate, immediate support during a mental health crisis — this funding helps make that possible.”
Since 988 launched in July 2022, the HCA has paid for 988 with various temporary sources of money, agency spokesperson Marina Pina told Source NM. SB535 allows the lifeline to receive sustained annual funding, she said.
The money will also go toward other crisis services that people receive through 988, including mobile crisis teams, behavioral health clinics, and crisis triage centers and other behavioral and mental health services, she said.
Workers’ comp
SB535, starting in July, raises how much employers and workers pay each quarter into the Workers’ Compensation Administration and the Uninsured Employers’ Fund, and raises the payments again in 2028 and 2033.
Employers’ fees will go from $2.30 to $2.80 per quarter, and workers’ fees will go from $2.00 to $2.50.
Public Regulation Commission
SB535 also increases the Public Regulation Commission’s inspection and supervision fee, charged to the utilities it supervises, from 0.506% to 0.59% of their total revenues, and creates an automatic annual increase based on a cost index published by the federal government.
Supported Decision-Making
The increased 911 funding was initially proposed in Senate Bill 137, which passed the Senate on March 1 but never received a hearing in the House of Representatives. However, the House Appropriations and Finance Committee amended it into SB535, which began as a zombie bill.
During floor debate on SB535, the House passed a floor amendment to include the Supported Decision-Making Act, which establishes a new program within the New Mexico Developmental Disabilities Planning Council’s Office of Guardianship for supported decision-making agreements, an alternative to adult guardianships.
The program is intended to enable adults to receive decision-making support without losing their rights. The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department will help people get connected to the new program, the agency said in a news release on Thursday afternoon.

“Providing more pathways to autonomy and self-determination strengthens our communities,” ALTSD Cabinet Secretary Emily Kaltenbach said in a statement. “This legislation will help ensure that those who need it have the necessary support to make informed decisions while maintaining their independence and dignity.”

Delaware high school students have a chance to win scholarships while raising awareness about a life-saving cause.
The Delaware Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Board has announced the launch of its 2025 Organ Donor Awareness Video Scholarship Contest, with up to $5,000 in total scholarships available.
The annual contest invites students in grades 9 through 12 to create a one- to two-minute public service video on the importance of becoming a designated organ and tissue donor.
Submissions will be judged on creativity, accuracy, and positive messaging. The deadline to enter is April 30, 2025.
Winners will be selected from each of Delaware’s three counties. First-place winners will receive a $1,000 scholarship, while second-place winners will earn $500.
“In our state, less than 50% of Delawareans are designated organ and tissue donors on their driver’s licenses or state IDs,” said Jill Fredel, chair of the Delaware Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Board and a kidney donor. “With National Donate Life Month in April, we want to encourage more young people to say ‘yes’ to becoming designated donors, a status they are likely to keep for the rest of their lives. This scholarship contest offers high school students a way to use their creativity, confidence and compassion to communicate the importance of organ and tissue donation to other young people.”
Students are encouraged to include interviews with transplant recipients in their videos to deepen the message and connect with viewers.
The contest coincides with National Donate Life Month in April, a time dedicated to honoring donors and raising awareness about the need for organ and tissue transplants.
The initiative is a collaboration between the Donor Awareness Board, the Delaware Department of Education, and Gift of Life, a nonprofit that supports organ donation across Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey.

Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.












We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith




Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

The retired school teacher is part of a network of citizen scientists contributing to the Nitrate Watch program, through the Izaak Walton League of America, to monitor the levels of nitrate and nitrite in surface and drinking water across the country. 
Monitors expect increased nitrate concentrations this month as part of the “spring flush,” when April showers wash fertilizer and other nutrients into the waterways. 
In past years, surface water in Iowa during this time tested in concentrations in excess of 10 milligrams per liter, which is the maximum contaminant level for drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Why monitor? 
Gradoville got involved with the program two years ago, shortly after finding out he had a pre-cancerous tumor on his bladder. It’s a type of cancer, he said, typically associated with tobacco smokers, but Gradoville had never smoked. 
He met someone with the same type of tumor who also wasn’t a smoker, which led him to poke around for other potential causes and he learned about nitrogen pollution in Iowa’s waters. 
A 2016 published study, analyzing bladder cancer in postmenopausal women in Iowa, found a link between long-term ingestion of elevated nitrate levels and bladder cancer. But other organizations, like the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network hold that “more research is needed” to determine the link between nitrate in drinking water and bladder cancer.   
Gradoville can’t say for sure what caused his, but it was inspiration enough to get involved with Nitrate Watch, which is open to anyone willing to test and submit their results.
Heather Wilson, the Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator with Izaak Walton League, said the human health concerns of the nutrient concentrations are “more and more” present in volunteers’ minds as they participate in the program. 
“Definitely more research is needed, but there’s a lot of research that already points to health impacts occurring even when the amount of nitrate in water is below the current drinking water standard,” Wilson said. 
Wilson said the associated impacts include blue baby syndrome, thyroid disease, neural tube birth defects and cancer. 
“That is of course a major concern, especially in Iowa, where cancer rates are climbing,” Wilson said.
The recently released Cancer in Iowa report for 2025 found that Iowa is one of only two states with rising rates of new cancer. 
Nutrient pollution in water also leads to environmental concerns, like algal blooms and dead zones. Iowa is part of a multistate effort to shrink the size of the hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, by reducing the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Mississippi River watershed. 
The task force engages state agencies, with a goal of reducing overall nitrogen load, through practices like cover cropping, reduced tillage, extended crop rotations and more intentional fertilizer application. 
Recent survey data showed the amount of cover crops planted on Iowa cropland has more than doubled since 2017. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship and Iowa State University released a free nitrogen application tool to help farmers fine tune their fertilizer applications, and lawmakers are pushing forward a bill to establish a pilot program and a $2 million appropriation to study ag practices that reduce overall nitrogen application. 
Wilson said the goal of Nitrate Watch is to support efforts, like these, to stop the pollution from getting into the water and to encourage water treatment efforts that protect consumers from potentially harmful drinking water.
Testing the water 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources monitors water quality across the state and provides assessments on the segments every other year, per the Clean Water Act. Wilson said citizen science monitoring doesn’t provide the same level of testing that a trained environmental specialist could, but it helps to “fill the gaps.” 
“There just simply aren’t enough people, professionals, DNR employees,” Wilson said. “They can’t possibly measure all the waterways, even if they wanted to.”
Wilson said Nitrate Watch serves as the “eyes on the ground” for acute pollution problems and can help draw attention to areas of high pollution. 
“We’re not replacing the monitoring of the DNR, or your local soil and water conservation district, we’re supplementing it,” Wilson said. 
A map from the Nitrate Monitor 2024 report, shows high participation in the program in Iowa, and high nitrate concentration levels across the state.

Wilson said Iowa has a lot of groups, like Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, local Izaak Walton Leagues, the Iowa Environmental Council, local conservation boards and more that are part of why “the map just lights up in Iowa.”
Wilson said the goal with Nitrate Watch is to make it “easy” and “enjoyable” for volunteers to participate. While volunteers are not prescribed a sampling regime, Gradoville has implemented his own schedule for testing. 
Each Monday, when the rivers aren’t frozen over, he tests at a site on the Des Moines River just downstream of Saylorville Lake, a site on Beaver Creek and the tap water in his home. 
Gradoville stops at a flowing part of the water, dips the test strip in quickly, then sets a timer for 30 seconds before reading the pink hue on the strip and logging it on the mobile app. 
Each stop takes him a couple of minutes. 
“It’s not a huge time commitment,” Gradoville said.
Now, after years of regular testing, he can see a chart of his three monitoring sites and the fluctuating nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the water. 
Especially now, but even before he started monitoring, Gradoville said his relationship to Iowa’s waters changed. 
“I used to love to jump into every stream and creek and pond and lake here in Iowa,” Gradoville said. “Well over the last number of years, you start seeing the water and see what’s in it … I don’t have any interest in doing that.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska residential rental costs used to be the highest in the nation.
Now the typical rent in Alaska is about the same as the national median for the first time on record, and 19 states have higher rental prices, according to an analysis by state economists.
That is a dramatic turnaround from the past.
In the first decades of statehood, rental prices in Alaska were far higher than those in any other state. In 1980, for example, Alaska’s median rent was about 50% above the national level and 18% higher than Hawaii, which then had the second-most expensive rental costs. Even in 2016, Alaska’s median rent was the nation’s sixth-highest, about the same as that in New York and Massachusetts, the analysis found. In a group of numbers, the median refers to the one in the middle, with half higher and half lower.
The analysis is published in Alaska Economic Trends, the monthly magazine of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s research section. It uses information from 2023, which is the most recent data available.
The study compares states’ gross rents, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, which include utilities.
Alaska’s median gross rent was $1,373 in 2023, the analysis said. California had the highest median rent of $1,992 that year, followed by Hawaii at $1,940 and the District of Columbia at $1,904.
Rental prices have risen over the years in all states, but the increase in Alaska over the past decades has been slower than that elsewhere.
That is not necessarily good news or bad news for Alaskans, and it does not necessarily mean that rents are cheap in Alaska, said Rob Kreiger, a state labor economist and co-author of the Trends article.
“Clearly, rents are moving up at a faster rate in the rest of the country than they are here. But we don’t know whether they are more affordable here than there,” he said. Affordability depends on how much renters are able to spend, he said. “You could have situations where wages are quite low and rent is less affordable,” he said.
Alaska’s rent trends roughly track the ebbs and flows of the state’s economy and demographic changes and the way Alaska conditions have compared to those in the Lower 48 states.
Twelve consecutive years of net outmigration – with more people leaving the state than moving in – was one factor that pushed Alaska’s rent-price ranking lower, the analysis said. So were the job losses related to an oil price slump from 2015 to 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic affected all states’ economies and rental prices, but Alaska had a slower post-pandemic recovery, the researchers note.
The inclusion of utilities as part of gross rents is a factor that may have slowed the increase in Alaska costs. Natural gas provided by utilities is much cheaper than the heating oil that Alaskans relied on in past decades, the report notes.
The findings include information about rental vacancy rates, which are now higher in Alaska than in the nation as a whole. That is a switch in recent years; from 2005 to about 2012, Alaska had a tighter rental market, with vacancy rates that were lower than the national rate, but since then Alaska’s rates have been higher or about the same as the national rate, according to the analysis. That is despite home construction activity that has been consistently lower in recent years than in the past, Kreiger said.
Still, it is difficult to calculate a statewide vacancy rate “because it varies so much from place to place,” he said. Parts of rural Alaska have dire housing shortages, for example.
While the comparison to national rates is new, the department’s research section does regular analysis of rental costs differences within Alaska.
The researchers, in cooperation with the Alaska Housing Finance Corp., publish annual reports on rental costs at different state locations, based on costs each March.
The most recent report found that among 10 regions, median rents in 2024 for two-bedroom apartments were lowest in the Wrangell-Petersburg area, at $1,081 a month, and highest in the Kodiak Island Borough, at $1,713 a month.

For Dr. Charles DeCarli of UC Davis — one of the country’s top dementia researchers — the abrupt cancellation of federal funding for his multi-year study was demoralizing. 
“This particular grant was the pinnacle of my research,” he told CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
As President Donald Trump’s administration looks to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the federal government and other institutions, DeCarli became swept up in the dragnet after he received a letter in March from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. The letter informed him that his nearly $36 million research project was being canceled because it perpetuated a “DEI” agenda.
About 5 million Americans have dementia, which affects a person’s ability to think, remember and perform daily tasks. Compared to white Americans, both Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to develop dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, the most common type of dementia. Dementia also disproportionately affects women.
DeCarli’s cancelled project had a remaining $10 million and included 28 clinical and research sites and 1,700 participants with mild cognitive impairments.

The termination letter: “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”

The University of California’s 10 campuses receive more than $2 billion in research funding from the NIH and carry out nearly a tenth of all academic research in the U.S. Besides DeCarli’s, the NIH terminated at least 30 other UC projects, totaling more than $173 million.
California has joined 15 other states to sue the NIH, and multiple lawsuits have been filed to halt the grant cancellations. While these cases play out in courts, however, DeCarli says his research — which has already been compromised due to the frozen funds — cannot continue without federal money.

DeCarli: “Dementia affects many Americans and their loved ones. It is an epidemic. It is a huge public health problem. This study … is trying to improve the health of all Americans.”

Huge fine issued to oil company

In what the California Coastal Commission described as the most expensive penalty imposed against a company, state regulators on Thursday voted to fine an oil company $18 million for repeatedly violating stop-work orders on a pipeline that was at the center of a major 2015 oil spill, writes CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
Last year the Houston-based company Sable Offshore Corp. purchased the Santa Barbara County pipeline from Exxon Mobil in order to restart production at the Santa Ynez oil operation. Operations ceased a decade ago after a spill unleashed more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil onto coastal land and ocean waters.
During the five-hour public hearing, the commission alleged that Sable ignored multiple cease-and-desist orders and continued repairing the corroded pipeline.

Meagan Harmon, commissioner: “Sable’s refusal to comply is a refusal to follow the law. Their refusal, in a very real sense, is a subversion of the will of the people of the state of California.”

But Sable argues that because the spill was caused by the pipeline’s previous owners, the commission is overreaching. It also says its actions were allowed under old permits issued by the county.

Steve Rusch, Sable’s vice president of environmental and governmental affairs, in a statement: “Sable is dedicated to restarting project operations in a safe and efficient manner. No California business should be forced to go through a protracted and arbitrary permitting process when it already has valid permits for the work it performed.”

Border Patrol to retrain agents

More than 900 U.S. Border Patrol agents in California are expected to be retrained following a controversial immigration raid the agency carried out in Kern County.
As CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos explain, the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of the United Farm Workers, sued Border Patrol and other federal agencies alleging that the January raid unlawfully targeted “people of color who appeared to be farm workers” and violated constitutional protections against arrests without probable cause. 
A CalMatters investigation also found that Border Patrol agents had no prior knowledge of criminal or immigration history for 77 of the 78 people arrested during the sweep.
Following the lawsuit filing, recent court documents show that the Department of Homeland Security issued updated legal guidance on April 4 to Border Patrol agents. It bans agents from the El Centro sector, which conducted the raids, from making warrantless arrests unless they can show both probable cause that someone is in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws, and that they are likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained.
The federal government also said El Centro sector agents will be trained on the rules, including how to comply with the Constitution. But leaders with the ACLU and the farm workers union remain unconvinced agents will follow the law. 

Elizabeth Strater, national vice president at the United Farm Workers: “It’s just a pinky swear. It’s a policy that could be withdrawn or changed at any time.”

Josh Heintzeman are funneling campaign donations to benefit themselves and pay for legal fees.
Keri Heintzeman said Zinda, who unsuccessfully primaried Rep. Josh Heintzeman last year, had an unnatural fixation on her family. 
Suddenly, a pajama-clad man from the crowd of about 100 interjected, accused Keri Heintzeman of lying and cut her off, after he’d already repeatedly interrupted the candidate forum.
Matt Kilian, president of the Brainerd Lakes Chamber of Commerce and the event’s moderator, had enough and asked the man to leave. After a brief conflict, a police officer escorted him out.
The candidates are running to replace former Sen. Justin Eichorn, a Grand Rapids Republican who resigned last month after being arrested and charged with the attempted coercion and enticement of a minor.
The special election embodies many of the trends that have emerged in American and Minnesota politics in the past few decades, from nasty name-calling to designs on dynasty.

And what Minnesota political story of the 2020s would be complete without Jennifer Carnahan, whose political career has careened from fallen state GOP party chair to congressional wife and widow, mayor of Nisswa and now Senate candidate. 
Plus, a cigarette-smoking, truck-driving Democrat, Denise Slipy, who is hoping she’ll be the one to finally win back some Greater Minnesota voters, against long odds.
Senate District 6 is ruby red Republican. Eichorn in 2022 won the seat by 27 points. Crow Wing County voted for President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 31 percentage points.
Voters will determine which Republican will run against Slipy, the sole Democrat, during a Tuesday primary. The general election is April 29.
The Republicans running include a West Point and Wharton graduate who is also military veteran; a veterinarian; the former mayor of Breezy Point, Minnesota, who is also 8-and-a-half months pregnant; a candidate backed by the far-right group Action 4 Liberty; and another who made racist remarks about a Republican candidate’s Korean heritage.
The Republican frontrunners, however, are well-known in the district: Keri Heintzeman, Josh Gazelka and Jennifer Carnahan, who was not at the Baxter forum due to illness, she said.
Keri Heintzeman
Keri Heintzeman was the director of Trump’s 2024 campaign in Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District. Her husband Josh has been in the Minnesota House since 2015, and Keri’s frequently been a presence at the Capitol, often with a few of their half dozen children in tow.

She’s out-raised her Republican opponents by far. In the few weeks since Eichorn resigned, she’s raised over $50,000, according to her campaign finance report.
Heintzeman, 44, has an organized campaign: She’s been knocking on doors, mailing campaign materials and recruited around 20 volunteers for field work.
In an interview with the Reformer, Heintzeman said she’s “by far the most conservative” candidate compared to the other Republicans running.
“I believe this district is blood red and loves President Trump and deserves a senator that will represent those values,” Heintzeman said.
The Heintzemans decided that when Josh was elected to the House, they weren’t going to split up the family, Keri Heintzeman said. The family stays at a hotel when the Legislature is in session. It’s a home base for other Republican legislators to kick back and unwind after a long day at the Capitol.
Keri Heintzeman was born in International Falls and has lived in the Brainerd Lakes area since eighth grade. She married Josh Heintzeman when she was 18 and has helped homeschool all six children.

Keri Heintzeman and her son were in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021, but she said they left after Trump spoke. They were two states away when they realized what was happening at the U.S. Capitol, she said. She said she was there to support Trump and believed “he had done a good job and deserved our respect for the four years that he had put in.” 
Keri Heintzeman said she believes there was fraud in the 2020 election and at minimum the U.S. should have voter ID laws.
Josh Gazelka
Josh Gazelka is the son of former Minnesota Senate majority leader and failed gubernatorial candidate Paul Gazelka.
Gazelka, 31, told the crowd at the candidate forum Tuesday he didn’t want to be there.
“I was not expecting to run. I was not intending to run. If you told me three weeks and one day ago that I’d be sitting here talking to you about my candidacy, I probably would have laughed you out of the room,” Gazelka said in an interview with the Reformer.
  Josh Gazelka speaks at a candidate forum in Baxter. (Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)
Gazelka said he felt an obligation to the community to step up and run after hearing the news about Eichorn’s arrest.
Gazelka said his campaign mostly consists of digital ads and calling voters on the phone. Campaign signs, he said, are hard to print expeditiously, so he’s taken a creative approach.
“Fortunately for me, a guy with the same last name as me, Gazelka, ran back in 2004. I tracked down some of his signs from 2004 and retrofitted them to work for this campaign,” Gazelka said.
He showed the signs to the Reformer but asked they not be photographed. The white and blue campaign signs say “Vote April 15 Gazelka.” The “Vote April 15” was placed on top of his dad’s name, “Paul,” but it’s still slightly visible.
Asked if he’s relying on name recognition alone, Gazelka said he’s trying to get his message out there so people learn who he is.
“Nepotism — that’s one that comes up. I’ve been called a second-generation swamp monster. A lot of creative names,” Gazelka said.
Gazelka is currently a vice president for a marketing company based in Texas. He owned a hard cidery, but it closed in part thanks to Minnesota’s hostile business climate, he said. Gazelka said he wants to bring a business perspective to the Legislature and pass bills that help struggling small businesses.
He said his father hasn’t given him campaign advice, but Paul Gazelka did give him a $500 campaign donation, according to his campaign finance report.
Jennifer Carnahan
Jennifer Carnahan is the former chairwoman of the Minnesota Republican Party who resigned in the wake of allegations that she presided over a toxic work culture — she was also connected to a major GOP donor who’s serving a 21-year prison sentence for child sex trafficking.
Which is less than ideal in a special election to replace Eichorn.

She declined the Reformer’s request for an interview. 
“I have no doubt your outlet will continue issuing salacious, misleading, and defamatory statements about me — without my voice,” Carnahan wrote in an email.
Carnahan won the Nisswa mayoral race in November, a political comeback after she’d tried to replace Hagedorn in Congress following his passing in 2022. 
She wound up in contentious litigation with Hagedorn’s family. And the state Republican Party after she left there. 
Late last month, Carnahan through her attorney sent the Minnesota DFL Party a letter threatening to sue unless the DFL retracted and publicly apologized for posting about Carnahan’s ties to Anton Lazzaro, the convicted sex trafficker whose arrest began the chain of events that led to her departure from the Minnesota GOP.
The Minnesota DFL Party published the letter from Carnahan’s attorney and responded with a flourish:
“You co-hosted a podcast with a child-sex trafficker, socialized with him, and raised huge sums of money from him to support Minnesota Republican candidates. If you follow through on this absurd lawsuit, it will end as one more addition to your long list of failures,” wrote Heidi Kraus Kaplan, Minnesota DFL executive director.
Carnahan has raised over $11,000 in individual campaign donations, according to her campaign finance report.
In a Wednesday Facebook post, Carnahan said the Heintzemans are trying to buy the Senate seat.
“We don’t need to have a husband and wife from the same household representing us in St. Paul. That’s a total conflict of interest. There is no independence there. It’s two people then that are looking out for their household and they’re living 100% solely on our taxpayer backs,” Carnahan said.
In a campaign post, Carnahan described herself as a “political outsider,” despite running for Minnesota Senate in 2016; serving as chair of the Minnesota Republican Party from 2017 to 2021; marrying a politician shortly after his election to Congress; serving on Trump’s Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during his first term; running for Congress in 2022; and serving as the current mayor of Nisswa.
Denise Slipy
Denise Slipy is an environmental health and safety professional and first responder for North Crow Wing County. She said she’d been gearing up to run for the Minnesota House in 2026, but is now taking a shot at the open Senate seat.
Slipy described herself as a moderate Democrat. People in the area know her, she said, because of her work as a first responder. She’s also dressed up as the Grinch a few times for Christmas.

She said that late DFL U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan was a good friend and mentor to her.
Slipy acknowledged that the district is very red, but she said she can sway Republican voters by listening and acting as a voice for rural Minnesotans in the Senate.
“There’s more that unites us than what divides us, and the extremes on either side … have to stop. The extremes are getting us nowhere. It’s those of us who are middle-thinking, moderate, common sense folks that need to have a voice at the table,” she said.
Slipy would bring geographic diversity to a metro-dominated DFL Senate caucus. She likes her American flag-bedecked clothes — and her smokes.
“I don’t condone smoking at any age for anybody. I do smoke, but I’m a person. That’s one of the big things — I’m gonna fight for you because I’m one of you,” Slipy said.
She also drives a truck with a sticker that reads, “Jesus loves everyone you hate.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/36-MNSEN-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 09:02:46.883562
,California,2025-04-11 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s lieutenant governor leases offices to the state. What if she’s elected governor?,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/california-governor-eleni-kounalakis/,Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis told CalMatters she will address potential conflicts of interest with her extensive property investments by establishing a blind trust if she is elected governor of California next year.,"In summary
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis told CalMatters she will address potential conflicts of interest with her extensive property investments by establishing a blind trust if she is elected governor of California next year.


Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who earns millions of dollars annually from extensive property investments around the Sacramento region and beyond, says she will put some of her holdings into a blind trust if she is elected governor of California.
The commitment follows an inquiry from CalMatters to Kounalakis, who is running for governor in 2026. According to financial disclosures, her portfolio includes downtown Sacramento office buildings that rent to dozens of organizations with business before the state and at least three state agencies.
“If elected governor, the LG commits to placing any assets that may present a conflict of interest into a blind trust,” David Beltran, a spokesperson for Kounalakis’ campaign, said in a statement.
Which of those assets would be transferred to the blind trust and how Kounalakis would determine what constitutes a conflict of interest, however, remains unclear. Her campaign declined to make Kounalakis available for an interview and did not answer questions seeking more detail about her plans.
California’s conflict of interest rules disqualify public officials from participating in governmental decisions that would foreseeably have an impact on their personal finances, though there is an exception if the potential effect on the official’s interests is indistinguishable from the effect on the public.
It can be particularly knotty for a governor to navigate, because they deal with everything in the state, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. “You can imagine any investment raising a question, big or small.”
Levinson said the blind trust offers a middle ground of walling off politicians from potential conflicts of interest as much as possible without the “draconian” step of forcing them to sell off their holdings.
Gov. Gavin Newsom placed his business holdings in a blind trust after he was elected in 2018, rather than selling the multimillion-dollar collection of wineries, restaurants, bars and a hotel. Under this arrangement, Newsom transferred control of the Plumpjack Group to a family friend, who is barred from discussing her management decisions with the governor. He later signed an executive order prohibiting all executive branch agencies from entering into business arrangements with any part of the Plumpjack Group.
Prime Sacramento real estate
Kounalakis is the daughter of the powerful Sacramento real estate developer Angelo Tsakopolous and she worked for the company he founded, AKT Development Corporation, for nearly two decades before then-President Barack Obama appointed her ambassador to Hungary in 2010. Her husband, foreign affairs scholar and writer Markos Kounalakis, is now a director of AKT Development Corporation and the affiliated AKT Investments, Inc.
Since she was elected lieutenant governor in 2018, Kounalakis has annually completed required statements of economic interests laying out her investments, real property holdings and other sources of income. She has not placed those assets in a blind trust.
The latest form, filed in February for her 2024 finances, lists ownership stakes in office buildings, farm and grazing land, solar fields, a parking lot and undeveloped properties across Northern California and the Central Valley, as well as in the Tsakopoulos Family Partnership, which has additional building and land interests.
Three of the buildings from which Kounalakis draws substantial income are located in the commercial corridor around the state Capitol where interest groups, lobbyists and others with business in state government concentrate their operations.
Kounalakis is a partner in Meridian Plaza, an office building across the street from Capitol Park in downtown Sacramento. She received at least $10,000 in rent last year from 34 different tenants of the building, according to her financial disclosure, most of them lobbying firms or groups that lobby the state government.
These include trade organizations representing automobile manufacturers, insurance companies, strawberry growers, beer distributors and the oil industry, as well as Microsoft, PG&E, Verizon and the tobacco producer Altria. At least two state agencies, the Department of Public Health and a branch of the Department of General Services, also have office space there.

Next door, another office building in which Kounalakis is a partner had half a dozen major tenants last year, including The California Endowment, a private foundation that advocates for expanding health care access; Rescue Agency, which works on public health campaigns with state departments; and Sikich, a firm that provides technology services to government.
Through the Tsakopoulos Family Partnership, Kounalakis receives rental income from One Capitol Mall, another office building down the street from the state Capitol, including at least $10,000 last year from the University of California’s governing board. Kounalakis sits on that board in her capacity as lieutenant governor.
Beltran stressed that Kounalakis is a minority owner in all her business investments and is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the properties. He did not explain why she would use a blind trust as governor if she did not feel the need to do so as lieutenant governor.
“The lieutenant governor has taken measures to ensure that any assets she owns do not impede her work as lt. governor,” Beltran said. “She will do the same as governor.”
‘That’s money in her pocket’
John Pelissero, the director of government ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said it would have been prudent for Kounalakis to take steps as lieutenant governor to distance herself from these assets, even though she generally does not vote on or sign legislation related to her clients.
“If she’s benefiting financially from lobbying, then the optics of it are troubling. It would be reasonable for any member of the public to look at that and say, ‘that’s odd,’” Pelissero said. 
He said the standard will be even higher if Kounalakis is elected governor and recommended that she then put her investments into a blind trust managed by an independent trustee that doesn’t have any communication with her.
As governor, Kounalakis would also be in a position to direct state agencies to lease offices at properties where she has an ownership stake.
“That’s money in her pocket,” said Tom Hiltachk, a political and election lawyer whose firm helped set up Arnold Schwarzenegger’s blind trust when he became governor in 2003. “She has to find a way to deal with that conflict.”
But Levinson said there is a low risk of conflicts of interest with the organizations that rent space in Kounalakis’ properties, because they have more direct ways of trying to curry favor with a governor, such as contributing to her campaign. Levinson added that she would be more concerned about Kounalakis adopting policies that benefit California landlords than making decisions that serve the tenants in her buildings.
“We’re just trying to make sure someone in a position of public trust is serving the public, not themselves,” Levinson said. “For my ear, her response is much better than somebody who says, ‘not to worry’ or ‘you can trust me’ or ‘let them come after me if they think there’s a problem.’”
Kounalakis earned at least $1.39 million — and likely far more — from her investments last year, according to a CalMatters analysis of her statement of economic interest. Income from each holding is reported in a range, up to “over $100,000.”
In addition to the rent from Meridian Plaza, which topped $340,000, Kounalakis reported more than $253,000 in income from other properties where she owns a share greater than 10%, including vineyards and row crop farms in Yolo County, grazing land in San Joaquin County, conservation credits in Placer County and a parking lot in downtown Sacramento. She and her husband have a small ownership of less than 10% in solar fields and grazing land in Santa Nella, which brought in more than $121,000 last year.
The Kounalakises also have a minority interest in the Tsakopoulos Family Partnership, from which the lieutenant governor reported more than $574,000 in income last year from Sacramento office building rent, a lease to an almond and rice farm in Placer County, the sale of an easement to the Placer Land Trust, a distribution from a Mill Valley restaurant and other investments.
The statement of economic interest further requires public officials to report their spouses’ income. According to the lieutenant governor’s financial disclosure, Markos Kounalakis earned more than $147,000 from his stake in an investment trust connected to the Tsakopolous family, more than $20,000 from serving as a director of AKT Investments, Inc., and as a political science lecturer at Stanford University, and less than $1,000 from his minority ownership of a podcast company and a boat.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/030822-Newsom-State-of-State-MG-CM-12-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-11 09:02:46.883562

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)The efforts to modify Maine’s solar energy incentive program continued Thursday as lawmakers introduced two more proposals to rework net energy billing. 
The Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee held a public hearing Thursday afternoon on the bills that as packed as the late February hearing on several proposals to tweak or toss net energy billing. Rather than scrap it altogether, the latest round of hearings focused on more ideas to amend the program by placing more limitations on new and existing projects and lowering the compensation rate.
Net energy billing is a utility program designed to encourage customers to develop or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. The program’s supporters see it as a tool to transition the state to clean energy that has been a scapegoat for rising energy costs. But critics argue that it’s already achieved the desired environmental goals and is now just a flawed system driving up bills.
There are two programs within net energy billing. First is the kilowatt hour program, which is open to all customers and provides kilowatt hour credits on participating customers’ bills if they install renewable energy generators such as solar panels or join a community solar project, where customers receive a portion of a solar farm’s credits. The credits expire after 12 months. 
The tariff rate program for nonresidential customers provides dollar credits for those who use their own projects or share in someone else’s. The Public Utilities Commission sets an annual rate for the credits, which also expire after 12 months, depending on the customer’s size and utility provider. 
With LD 1317, Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) wants to adjust the tariff rate over the next few years to eventually reach 12 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2028.
Many believe Maine’s net energy billing needs reform, but diverge on whether to tweak or toss

Solar companies, including ReVision Energy, said that while they appreciated the attempt at a compromise, the 12 cent rate would not be sufficient. In response to Bennett saying that he landed on that amount so solar developers could still make a profit, albeit not as fast, industry representatives said that it isn’t workable for projects designed with a higher compensation rate in mind.
Though the rate adjustment would apply retroactively, Bennett said he tried to strike a balance with his bill to reduce costs for ratepayers without changing other rules for people who have already entered into contracts. 
Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) proposed going further to limit the growth of net energy billing costs by reducing qualifying project size and adding termination dates with LD 1321. The bill would not only reduce the capacity of projects to 60 kilowatts from 1 megawatts, but it would also limit compensation, increase transmission costs for net energy bill participants and restrict how long someone may participate in the program to either 20 years or until Dec. 31, 2045 — whichever is sooner. 
Individuals who work in community solar opposed the bill, fearing it would threaten the viability of an industry they have seen bring down costs for ratepayers and create jobs for Mainers. They argued that the proposed sunset and size limits could have a chilling effect on investments in these projects that have contributed to local economies and helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
“Broad retroactive modifications to the core mechanisms in determining compensation under the program as these bills propose and others will have a dramatic effect on 16,000 projects in the state, more than 114,000 customers,” said Caroline Colan, legislative liaison for the Governor’s Energy Office, testifying against the bills. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce supports Foster’s proposal because it addresses “concerns in a way that balances cost predictability with program flexibility,” said Government Relations Specialist Ashley Luszczki. However, she suggested a successor program that would still encourage solar development projects between 60 kilowatts and 1 megawatt. 
The Maine Wild Blueberry Commission was similarly supportive of LD 1321, seeing it as a means to reduce skyrocketing energy costs that they said have hit the profits of farms and other Maine businesses in recent years.
However, because half of all electricity used in New England is generated using natural gas, that market is the primary driver of energy prices, according to the Governor’s Energy Office. 
The Public Utilities Commission and the Office of Public Advocate testified neither for nor against the proposals heard Thursday.
Like the two bills heard Thursday, the other proposals related to net energy billing were introduced by Republicans, who have largely opposed the program since the tenure of former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who vetoed several legislative efforts to incentivize the proliferation of cleaner energy. 
Net energy billing, or Maine’s version of net metering, was expanded in 2019 under Gov. Janet Mills so that customers can use renewable generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. Legislation passed two years later added a goal of 750 megawatts of distributed generation through net energy billing.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0370-scaled-e1696034646170-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 12:21:21.706345

Lujan Grisham signs into law climate-change funding.","Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has through April 11 to sign or veto remaining legislation. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday signed into law Senate Bill 48, the Community Benefit Fund, which contains $210 million for communities to use for a series of projects to mitigate climate change impacts. These include: train workers in the oil and gas industry for other jobs; reduce oil and gas emissions; improve the electric grid; develop renewable energy projects; modify public buildings to be more energy efficient; reduce the impacts of climate change on human health, agriculture and the environment; purchase electric vehicles and develop charging infrastructure.
In a written statement Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, called the law “a step in the right direction.” 
“With the federal government abandoning its responsibilities to the states, there is so much work to be done,” Schlenker-Goodrich said in the statement. “The Community Benefits Fund provides hope that New Mexicans can step into the void and get it done.”
Lujan Grisham signed the bill as the federal government makes moves to clamp down on state climate change work via an executive order signed earlier this week. Experts, however, say Trump’s order violates the constitutional principles and would be unlikely to survive a court challenge.
Lujan Grisham, in her capacity as co-chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, issued a joint statement with Co-Chair New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in response to Trump’s order that said: “The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority. We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred. We will keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis that safeguard Americans’ fundamental right to clean air and water, create good-paying jobs, grow the clean energy economy, and make our future healthier and safer.”
The governor on Thursday also signed Senate Bill 23, which raises oil and gas royalty rates on prime tracts of state lands in the Permian Basin from 20% to 25%. The change is expected to generate  $50 million to $75 million in revenue for the state’s land grant permanent fund which primarily pays out to schools, universities and hospitals. The last time the Legislature last updated royalty rates was in the 1970s.
All told, Lujan Grisham signed an additional 22 bills into law Thursday, leaving 38 pieces of legislation in the balance, with one day left to act. 
Outstanding bills include House Bill 2, which contains the $10.8 billion dollar budget for the state government, and the list of capital outlay projects, which may see line-item vetos, striking a certain project or item and leaving the rest of the bill intact. 
So far, the governor has signed 157 bills into law — about 80% of the bills sent up to her desk — and vetoed two pieces of legislation. Lujan Grisham has until the end of Friday, April 11 to sign or veto legislation. Any unsigned bill after the deadline passes fails to become law, a power called the “pocket veto.”

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)For Eida Fuji, the mother of a transgender child, access to gender-affirming medical care wasn’t a matter of “policy disagreement” but a matter of life and death for her family. 
“I was faced with a choice of burying a son or gaining a daughter,” Fuji said in a tearful testimony to state lawmakers last month. “My daughter is alive today because she had access to the gender-affirming care she needed. This care did not harm her or confuse her. It saved her life. Without it, I have no doubt I would be mourning my daughter instead.”
Despite widespread support from medical groups, the nation has seen an increase in legislative, political, and cultural attacks against gender-affirming care, including social transitioning and puberty blockers. 
Nevada law doesn’t restrict medically necessary gender-affirming care.
Yet, families of trans children along with pediatricians throughout the state still worry bans in other states could prevent trans youth from seeking care and doctors from providing it. 
Senate Bill 171, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall, seeks to enact a shield law for medical providers who offer gender-affirming care and prevents a medical license board from punishing or disqualifying providers. 
The bill passed out of the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee Thursday in a party-line vote.
The legislation also prevents a Nevada governor “from surrendering or issuing a warrant for the arrest of an individual who is charged in another state with the crime of providing, assisting or receiving medically necessary, gender-affirming health care services unless those acts are prohibited under Nevada law.”
He sponsored a similar bill in 2023. It passed both houses in a party-line vote and then was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
In his veto message, the governor wrote the bill “decreases the Executive Branch’s authority to ensure the highest public health and child safety standards for Nevadans.”
Ohrenschall, along with the numerous medical providers and pediatricians who testified in support of the bill, said the legislation is needed more than ever. 
“Many states have criminalized or otherwise restricted gender-affirming care, even when it’s medically necessary or provided with the informed consent of the patients and their families,” he said. 
The states that have passed bans “not only harm transgender individuals but create a climate of fear and uncertainty for health care providers who offer gender-affirming health care services.”
Democratic state Sen. Melanie Scheible, a cosponsor of SB 171, said the bill was necessary to address the fact “we are currently living in a constitutional crisis” and some states “are attempting to expand their jurisdiction beyond their legal borders in ways we have not seen in generations before us.” 
“If people, who apparently do not understand how state’s rights work or how the United States Constitution is structured, are going to attempt to come to Nevada, threaten our providers for following our laws and not following their laws, we are saying to our providers ‘we are going to protect you,’ ” Scheible said.
Though Lombardo vetoed the shield law in 2023, he did sign other legislation expanding protections for the trans community. 
Leann McAllister, the executive director of the Nevada chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, noted that Lombardo also signed legislation that shielded in-state providers serving out-of-state  patients who sought abortion care. 
“In my mind, evidence based care is evidence based care,” McAllister said. “Why should abortion care be covered and not gender affirming care?”
The ‘opposition is misinformed’
The American Academy of Pediatrics policy regarding trans kids “encompasses all sorts of gender affirming care, even including the social transition,” which helps children and their families access their identity, said Terence McAllister, a Las Vegas based primary care pediatrician. 
“The more important thing, the thing we really concentrate on, is the social transitioning and the mental health support from the very beginning,” he said. “We know that children who are trans are at higher risk for depression, anxiety and suicide. It’s not because they’re trans, It’s because they’re not accepted.”
Other medical interventions that are considered gender-affirming care include hormone treatment and puberty blockers. 
“The most extreme type of intervention are surgical interventions, which are exceedingly rare in pediatrics,” he said. “I’ve had no patients of mine who have gone to that step. It is just very unusual, very rare in pediatrics.”
Nevada state law hasn’t restricted specific types of gender affirming care, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary and a parent or guardian has granted consent. 
Though the state hasn’t actively sought to limit gender-affirming care like other states, Julpohng Vilai, a pediatrician based in Southern Nevada, said offering health care for LGBTQ adolescents has become increasingly challenging over the years.
Vilai’s patients tell him it is already a struggle for those in the LGBTQ community, in particular trans youth, to find adequate health care. Nevada already struggles with a physician shortage, making it all the more challenging for trans youth to find a doctor. 
As a result, many trans youth don’t seek needed care “because they’re not sure if they can find it,” he said. 
“When they actually do find a provider who is not only willing to provide that care, but has a lot of experience in providing that care and wants to provide, the support and care that people need is really important,” he said. 
Another reason finding care has become difficult is partly due to increased anti-LGBTQ rhetoric around the country and a growing number of bills in state legislatures seeking to restrict trans people from access to health care and public accommodations.
President Donald Trump’s return to office has intensified the attacks against the trans community.
There are already pediatricians who were “already on the fence” on providing gender-affirming care, who have decided not to take on trans patients “at risk of retaliation or legal consequences,” Vilai said. 
Many doctors backing SB 171 worry efforts by other states to restrict medical care for trans youth could exacerbate provider uncertainty and reluctance in Nevada. That’s why they are imploring lawmakers to pass a shield law to protect medical providers, they said. 
Ohrenscall said 26 states have passed bans on gender-affirming health care “that have caused significant harm to the community.” 
Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sought to investigate an out-of-state provider offering gender-affirming care to a minor. Paxton accused a Seattle hospital of providing puberty blockers, which are banned in Texas, to youth in the state.
His investigation was dropped. However, supporters of Nevada’s bill worry there could be future efforts to investigate or even extradite doctors in other states who provide gender affirming care. 
Scheible used the example of marijuana laws and how various states mandate where consumption is legal and how many ounces a person may possess. Nevada’s laws, she said, could be different from Colorado’s law.  
She added it would be ludicrous for Nevada officials considered arresting or investigating someone in Colorado.  
“That’s exactly what other states are trying to do,” she said. “They are trying to say in Texas we are going to ban the prescription of puberty blockers.” 
SB 171 is opposed by conservative groups, including the Nevada Republican Party, which argue the bill decreases the governor’s authority to “ensure the highest public health and child safety standards for Nevadans” — an echo of Lombardo’s veto message two years ago.
Ohrenschall reiterated that the legislation doesn’t change “what is legal, medical care in Nevada.”
“What it does do, and what it will do if it is passed, is protect health care providers, patients and their families when seeking legal medical care in Nevada,” he said. “Much of the opposition testimony is misinformed. We did not hear from any health care provider opposed to this bill.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ohrenschall-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 09:02:46.883562

(Photo: Alejandra Rubio/Nevada Current)A campaign finance measure championed by Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar seeks to make elected office financially feasible for more individuals by allowing campaign contributions to be spent for some personal uses.  
Nevada law currently prohibits candidates for public office and elected officials from spending campaign contributions for personal use. The prohibition deters some individuals from serving in low-paying positions such as state legislator, which pays $130 a day for the first 60 days of the 120-day session, plus per diem amounts for travel and expenses. 
Assembly Bill 79 would allow candidates and elected officials to pay for the cost of child care, the care of an elderly parent, or for the individual’s health insurance premiums, if they are unable to afford the cost as a result of their public service. It relies on the “irrespective test”, which reflects the standards used by the Federal Election Commission. 
“If it’s a cost that would not exist without your public office, you can use campaign funds to pay for it,” Gabriel Di Chiara, chief deputy secretary of state, said during an interview Wednesday. Aguilar “and other folks in the community believe, for example, that one of the limitations of serving in the Legislature is the low pay, the inability to have things like child care, elder care, et cetera, covered. If you have dependents and you’re not making any money because you’re serving in the Legislature, how can you be expected to provide care for them?”
The Federal Election Commission allows candidates and public officials to use campaign funds for child care, and has since 2018, Di Chiara told lawmakers Thursday during a hearing of the Assembly Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections.
“For example, unlike private sector workers or some other public employee types, public school teachers lose their health insurance when they serve in the Legislature, even though they technically remain employed,” Di Chiara said. “This is a cost that would not exist irrespective of their service.”
Additionally, a legislator from Las Vegas who has free childcare from a relative, but has no free childcare in Carson City during the session, would be incurring “a cost that would not exist irrespective of your service.”
However, Di Chiara could not say if campaign funds could be used to cover an existing cost that becomes burdensome as a result of public service.  
“I could see a candidate using it that way, yes,” he said via text. “If a complaint was filed, there would be an investigation and the SOS and AG would render an opinion.” 
$5,000 here, $5,000 there…
The bill requires every candidate who receives $100 or more to file a notice of intent to file for candidacy with the Secretary of State, a measure intended to avoid the fraudulent collection of campaign funds. However, the candidate does not have to specify the office sought. 
Aguilar’s bill also seeks to close a loophole that has been used by candidates in special elections to receive a maximum contribution of $10,000 per contributor – twice the intended amount, according to the Secretary of State’s office. 
Nevada’s campaign finance law clearly states candidates may receive contributions of $5,000 for the primary election and $5,000 for the general election from the same individual or entity. But it makes no mention of special election limits, an ambiguity acknowledged by the Secretary of State’s Office.
Candidates cite Secretary of State’s guidance for alleged campaign finance violations  

Last year, Judges Erika Mendoza and Tina Talim, who were appointed to Clark County District Court in 2024 by Gov. Joe Lombardo, received contributions exceeding $5,000 from the same individual or entity in their special elections, which were on the general election ballot in November. 
Mendoza, at the time, referred the Current to a Secretary of State campaign guide that advises candidates who don’t have a primary opponent that they can accept $5,000 contributions in the primary, and again in the general, from the same individual or entity. The provision, however, is irrelevant to special elections. 
“A special election would never have a primary,” Aguilar’s spokesperson Cecilia Heston said at the time. 
“It has become clear that additional clarification on campaign contribution limits are necessary,” says an amendment to AB 79 filed by Aguilar, which sets the contribution limit for a special election at $5,000, “regardless of whether that special election is on a general election ballot.” 
The amendment also seeks to clarify that a single candidate in a primary race may raise $5,000 in the primary. “This has been the historical interpretation of existing statute, and we would like it codified,” said…
Nevada law requires candidates, public officers and former public officers to dispose of unspent contributions. AB 79 requires that the Secretary of State be notified when those funds have been spent. 
It also requires a PAC to open a bank account no later than a week after receiving $1,000 or more in total contributions, and mandates that PACs, like candidates, report the balance in campaign accounts at the end of each reporting period. 
The measure would also exclude non-profit organizations from filing as a PAC.
Excluding nonprofit organizations from registering as PACs “creates transparency concerns, as it encourages a major expansion of dark money in our elections,” testified Joshua Skaggs, legislative affairs director for the Nevada Republican Party. 
The bill would make campaign account information available to the Secretary of State in the event of an investigation or issuance of a fine. The bill renders the account information confidential.
“We wanted to set up an independent hearing process so that if we ask for documents and if a campaign does not provide them, we can set up an administrative hearing where both sides lay out their case,” says DiChiara.
Aguilar told lawmakers his “three guiding principles for the upcoming biennium are modernization, innovation and transparency. This bill is heavily focused on transparency.”

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate Thursday unanimously approved a bill that would revamp the way the state funds public K-12 schools. 
SB 305, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would establish the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) program along with a dedicated Fund to move the state toward a funding model aimed at getting more resources to special needs students.
“We took a big step as a state today in that we established this RAISE Act fund, because we’re acknowledging that it does take more to educate children in poverty, or English language learners or special education students or gifted students,” Orr said after the vote.

The bill would transition to a formula meant to support students with greater needs through an updated funding structure. Alabama currently allocates funds based on a formula that ties funding more to headcount than student needs. Most states have weighted funding for different student needs.
“We want to provide more resources to our education community, our K-12 education communities and schools and get them help to do the job that they have to do with additional resources, and that’s important,” Orr said.
Under the proposed system, schools would receive supplemental funds, or “weights,” based on the number of students they enroll who fall into specific categories, including poverty, special education, English language learners, gifted status, and those attending charter schools.
The exact amount of additional funding generated per student would depend on the category and would be determined annually in the state’s Education Trust Fund budget, subject to available funding. 
The Senate also approved a related bill to shift $375 million from the Educational Opportunities Reserve Fund — a state savings account for education built from budget surpluses — into the newly proposed RAISE Fund. According to Orr, this amount is intended to fund the program for its initial three years.
“If the Legislature does its part over the years, slowly increasing that funding amount, I see much better things in the public education system in our state,” he said, adding that “if the locals will use the money wisely and use it to make good choices, that will move the needle for students.”
Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, asked Orr why charter schools were included in the weights, saying there are greater needs. Orr said that, unlike public school systems, charter schools don’t typically get local funding, and if they do, it’s not much. Orr said the weighted funding would help “make up for the loss of local funds.”
“In the same spirit, why can’t we give some of that money to the public school that’s got the D to pull it up, instead of kicking it to the curve and sayiing, ‘We got to bring something else in new, because we got a D situation,’” Smitherman said.
The bill now moves to the House for consideration.

(Photo: Governor's office)Last week at the Hands Off protest in Carson City, likely the largest in that red town’s history, and part of the largest mobilization in the U.S. since Donald Trump took office, I spoke against Joe Lombardo’s cowardice from the perspective of a senior citizen who wants to give my 7th-generation Nevada grandkids a shot at a stable democracy and a livable planet.
Apparently, Gov. Lombardo heard us. He told his supporters that the 7,000 Nevadans who showed up only wanted government handouts and we were paid to be there. To those of us who exercise our Constitutional rights as Americans to criticize our elected officials, Lombardo laughed and said,  “F**k you.”

The April 5th crowd was largely older people like me, who came up before the normalization of public vulgarity and who worked our entire lives to pay into Social Security and Medicare. We vehemently oppose Elon Musk and Trump attempting to screw millions of workers and retirees out of these earned benefits.
Lombardo knows about handouts. He has a solid track record of giving hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks, on behalf of Nevada workers, to his billionaire buddies like Elon Musk and the owner of the Oakland A’s. 
As long as the oligarchic ruling class is on the receiving end, and not people with disabilities, seniors, or students, he’s all for government handouts. 
Lombardo’s track record of genuflecting to all things Trump goes back to when the former sheriff endorsed a convicted felon and claimed, “Not only will President Trump bring down the rising costs of housing, groceries, and gas, he will usher in a new era of American prosperity.” And he has gone all out for Trump since.
Lombardo led the applause, in a far right publication, for the abolishment of the Department of Education, which will further erode public education for Nevada’s kids who can’t afford the private schools Lombardo’s rich buddies send their kids to.
He cowered in silent acquiescence while Trump tried to seize control of our state’s elections to federally restrain voting rights.
Lombardo cosigned with other Republican governors and pledged to deploy the Nevada National Guard for mass deportations at Trump’s command.
He defended Trump’s tariffs by saying Nevadans “need to feel a little pain in the short term” and that he will deal with them “on the fly.”
Lombardo is also working hard to one-up Trump’s dismantling of decades of efforts to address the climate crisis by replacing the Nevada climate plan with his own  blueprint for fossil gas expansion.
Like Trump, who has granted every wish of the oil billionaires to slow down the momentum we’ve made on climate change, Lombardo is bending over backwards for his buddies at Southwest Gas and NV Energy to build out polluting fracked methane plants.
If and when Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to imprison those of us who lawfully protest, we can be sure that Lombardo will stand idly by.
In short, Lombardo is a coward. He is afraid to say in public what he says behind our backs. At the most dangerous moment in American history since the Civil War, he is too fearful of MAGA primary voters to stand up to Trump. As someone who (illegally) campaigned in his sheriff’s uniform to project himself as the embodiment of justice, truth and patriotic values, he is beyond absolution because he knows better. 
Lombardo’s defense of the current state of affairs and his back room, expletive-laden attacks on Nevadans are dishonorable and despicable. His days are numbered because when we vote in the 2026 election, we’ll send him packing back to Las Vegas.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lombardo-and-musk-copy.jpg,,,2025-04-11 08:05:06.308877

It allows an organization fitting the description of the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa) to offer a health care plan that exists outside of state regulations and is only available to people who are members of the nonprofit.
“The rising cost of health care is a significant burden for our farmers,” Faulkner said when he introduced his legislation on the floor. “As legislators, there is little we can do about fertilizer costs, or the price of cotton. But we can make a difference in one of the largest household costs for many farmer families and other citizens in Alabama regarding their health care coverage.”

Faulker’s proposal was introduced last week at the Alabama House Health Committee when the committee hosted a public hearing, and members of the public voiced several concerns regarding the bill.
Members of the committee considered the legislation once again Wednesday, and several lawmakers on the committee introduced amendments to the bill even though the sponsor did not always agree with all the proposals.
Two days later, Faulker’s bill was approved in the House and passed onto the Senate.
The bill allows Alfa to offer health plans that include outpatient services and hospital visits; visits to the emergency room; mental health and substance abuse services and prescription drug benefits.
Members enrolled in the plan cannot be denied coverage because of a pre-existing medical condition. The plan cannot be cancelled because of a medical event.
If someone enrolled in the plan must visit a provider that is not in the network, Alfa will pay that provider the median amount of the in-network rate or 80% of the maximum allowed charge for the service.
Only members of the Alabama Farmers Federation can enroll in the health care plan, and only after they certify that they are not able to enroll in a health plan sponsored by their employer or that enrolling in the plan is too expensive.
Under the bill, only insurance agents authorized by Alfa can market and sell the plan. The Alabama Department of Insurance may also review and comment on any complaint that a person enrolled in the plan files which will then be forwarded to the third party responsible for addressing the complaint.
Several people during a public hearing on April 3 expressed concerns regarding the legislation prior to lawmakers introducing amendments to change the bill in committee. They said that it lacks several protections afforded to patients that are in the Affordable Care Act.
“We believe this bill threatens those protections by allowing the sale of health plans that are not required to cover essential health benefits… and can discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions, including cancer,” said Jane Adams during the public hearing, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) in Alabama, during the public hearing last Wednesday.
Numerous changes were made to the bill after several lawmakers in the committee during Wednesday’s meeting submitted amendments to include the other benefits, such as prescription drug coverage and mental health and substance abuse and allow for greater oversight by the Alabama Department of Insurance.
On the House floor Thursday, Rep. Paul Lee, R-Dothan, the chair of the House Health Committee, proposed an amendment setting the annual limit on the benefits of the health plan at least $2 million.
“We want to make sure that our farmers are taken care of,” Lee said. “I am the first generation away from a dependence on farming, so I understand it, growing up in it. So, I know the hard times, the late nights, getting up and looking for a cloud in the sky. I understand that. We want to make sure that farmers get the best thing, and anything we can get in this bill.”
The Alabama Hospital Association proposed the provision to lawmakers.
Much of the debate circled around an amendment proposed by Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, R-Foley, and approved in committee that said  the Alabama Department of Insurance “shall enforce this act.”
Faulkner, who opposed the amendment, moved to remove it from the bill Thursday, saying it was “very confusing.”
“The state’s Department of Insurance does not regulate self-funded plans,” he said. “And the federal regulation that applies to self-funded plans does not have any application to our bill. Our bill is far more comprehensive, and so it doesn’t make sense for that to be on there.”
The debate over the move took two hours.
“These amendments, this one in particular, that says the plan will be enforced by the Department of Insurance, it is just a precaution,” said Holk-Jones, who has worked in the insurance industry for the past 40 years. “It is a precaution for those individuals who have this policy. I call it a prenup. While we are in love with each other, and while we are agreeing to everything, that is when we want the prenup.”
The chamber voted to remove the language.
The bill moves to the Senate.

While the legislation  provoked strong opinions from both supporters and proponents at two hearings in the Alabama House Health Committee, it passed the House with little debate.
Whitt’s bill restricts the sale of hemp products to people who are younger than 21 years old and limits the sale of the product to stores that sell alcohol and standalone shops that do not allow minors access.
It also limits the THC content to five milligrams for hemp products that people consume as well as beverages, along with imposing sales tax on such items.
Opponents of the legislation said that the regulations set in the bill do not support the data related to the market for hemp products during the public hearing at the Alabama House Health Committee meeting last Wednesday.
Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence, said in an interview in March that 235 cases dealt with Delta-8 THC, a type of cannabinoid and that amounts to 0.018% of the cases for Alabama residents who are younger than 21 years old.
Law enforcement supports the bill, and said that tests on the product showed that the THC levels from products that were purchased exceeded the 0.3% hemp limit.
Members of the committee considered the legislation once again during the committee meeting Wednesday and approved it Thursday’s vote on the House floor.
“When you go into a convenience store and see these products, you think that someone has looked over them, and that is just complete inaccuracy,” Whitt said.

(House committee stream screengrab)President Donald Trump’s nominee to direct the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management withdrew from consideration ahead of a Thursday Senate hearing after a highly critical 2021 memo in which she criticized Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection surfaced.
Kathleen Sgamma, the head of the Western Energy Alliance oil and gas trade group, did not appear for a scheduled Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing on Thursday to begin the confirmation process.
During the hearing, U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chair of the committee, said he was informed on Thursday by the White House that Sgamma had withdrawn her name from consideration.
Trump nominated Sgamma, an outspoken critic of former President Joe Biden’s increased regulation of fossil fuels, for the position in February.
The sudden withdrawal comes after a journalism project known as Documented released a 2021 memo of Sgamma detailing her “disgust” for the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capital and “President Trump’s role in spreading misinformation that incited it” to oil executives the day after the insurrection
“I’m disgusted that he discredited all the good work he did reorienting the judiciary back toward respect of the rule of law and constitution by dishonoring the vote of the people and the rulings of those very same judges on his numerous challenges,” she wrote in a Jan. 7 memo. “I’m disheartened he besmirched his smart, well-intentioned people in the agencies who did such good work on important policies that advance the crucial mission of making life-sustaining, affordable energy accessible to all Americans, no matter their race, gender or political orientation.”
“We must listen to and accept others whom we disagree with, even when they don’t return that respect. We must stick to our nation’s founding principles and the sanctity and rights of every individual, even as many forces are undermining those basic principles,” she wrote.
In the memo Sgamma said that Trump’s 2020 electoral defeat provided “hope for a resurgence of sanity.”
She ended the memo to industry organization’s members by wishing then-President-elect Joe Biden “the best of luck in his goal to return to normalcy and moderation.”
Sgamma posted on LinkedIn that she supports Trump’s agenda and was honored to be nominated by President Donald Trump, but did not directly address why she withdrew.
“I also appreciate all the support I received from ranchers, sportsmen’s and recreation groups, conservationists, tribes, states, counties, the energy, mining and timber industries, and many other stakeholders across the West. I remain committed to President Trump and his unleashing American energy agenda and ensuring multiple-use access for all,” she wrote.
The White House issued a brief statement on her withdrawal. “We accept her withdrawal and look forward to putting forth another nominee,” said spokesperson Liz Huston.
The Bureau of Land Management controls about 245 million acres of land, 30% of the country’s minerals, according to the agency. The lands have multiple uses, including energy development, mining, livestock grazing and conservation.
Several environmental groups opposed Sgamma’s nomination due to her advocacy for fewer restrictions on oil and gas companies and push for more energy extraction on public lands. She has also repeatedly sued the federal government to expand oil and gas drilling on public lands under past administrations. 
Sgamma also helped author the controversial Project 2025 presidential transition plan, which detailed plans to reshape the Interior Department including reversing regulations meant to slow climate change and increasing oil and gas leases on public lands.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Freshman U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Democrat from Bay City, ruled out a run for U.S. Senate Thursday, saying she will instead seek reelection to the House.
“I love mid-Michigan, and representing our region in Congress is the honor of my lifetime. I first ran for office because too many families in our district work hard but struggle to get by, and now they are worried about what extreme proposals from DC would mean for their lives and their ability to make ends meet,” McDonald Rivet said in a statement. “In this moment, each of us should put ourselves in the position that allows us to do the most good. So I am excited to run for re-election in our highly competitive district, help win back the House, and move an agenda that uplifts the working people in our communities.”
McDonald Rivet had been exploring a possible Senate candidacy following the announcement in January by U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) that he would not seek reelection in 2026, a surprise decision that complicates Democrats already-slim chances of retaking the upper chamber next year. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 advantage. 
Her decision leaves state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who announced last week she was running for Peters’ seat, as the only announced candidate for the Democratic nomination. Potential rivals include U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who Politico reported in February had hired additional staff for a possible run, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) and Abdul El-Sayed, a former gubernatorial candidate who recently stepped down as Wayne County’s health director to explore a possible run.
On the Republican side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) has hinted at another run for Senate in 2026 after being narrowly defeated last November by Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly). Former gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon, U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland), and state Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, (R-Coldwater) have also been mentioned as mulling candidacies.
There had been speculation that U.S. Rep. John James might enter the race for the GOP nomination, but he ended that with his announcement Monday that he was instead running for governor.
McDonald Rivet’s decision to seek reelection to the House isn’t a sure thing.

Jeff Farnan, a Republican from Stanberry, testifies to a Missouri House committee during the 2024 legislative session (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). Missouri’s child care crisis was debated again Wednesday, with a bill changing provisions for licensed in-home child care facilities passing through the state House.
State law allows up to two children aged 5 years or older that are related to the operator of a child care facility to be exempt from the maximum number of children for which the facility is licensed. A bill sponsored by state Rep. Jeff Farnan, a Republican from Stanberry, removes the age minimum with hope to increase space in day care facilities.
“At unlicensed day care facilities, we don’t know if these kids are getting the care that they deserve, so hopefully this bill will increase the slots in licensed daycare facilities,” Farnan said in an interview.
Lawmakers originally pushed for changes to the state’s in-home child care provisions after the legislature approved “Nathan’s Law” in 2019.
According to previous Missourian reporting, the law was written to limit the capacity of unlicensed child care homes. It is named after Nathan Blecha, a 3-month old who died at an unlicensed in-home day care in 2007.
While the exclusion limit was set for unlicensed day cares, the same wasn’t set for licensed ones. All children had to be counted regardless of age. Child care providers around the state were then forced to stop serving families so they could care for their own.
A bill was eventually passed in 2022 permitting licensed care providers to exempt up to two of their children as long as they are 5 years old.
Legislators recalled Nathan’s Law when during Wednesday’s debate.
“The reason we have ratios in place in day care centers is to ensure that every child there has the proper care that they need,” said state Rep. Keri Ingle, a Lee’s Summit Democrat. “This is unfortunately one of those bills that is trying to address a problem and will create an even bigger one. At stake are the lives of the children in this state.”
Safety of child care facilities is just one facet of the state’s child care crisis. According to previous Missourian reporting, 54% of Missourians live in child care deserts.
Emily van Schenkhof is the executive director of the Missouri Children’s Trust Fund, the state’s foundation for child abuse prevention. She testified against the bill during a March hearing in the Committee on Children and Families.
“We maintain that we need to solve the state’s child care crisis without decreasing the safety of children in Missouri, so we are disappointed that this bill is moving forward,” van Schenkhof said.
The new bill moves the state away from best practices of child care capacity limits, she said.
Farnan said he shares the same concerns about safety, but believes that licensed child care providers receive adequate help from the state.
“They have fire services, they have food services and they have people that come check on them regularly to make sure that they are getting the care that they deserve,” Farnan said.
Still, van Schenkhof said solving the crisis without decreasing the safety of children is difficult.
“It’s hard to change the root factors that are causing the child care crisis,” van Schenkhof said. “Even though passing a bill isn’t easy, it’s easier than the financial investments we’d need to make to solve our child care problem.
The bill passed by a vote of 103-39. It now moves to the Missouri Senate.

(Photo courtesy of Utah Fire Info)Amid a growing number of wildfires, mostly across Western states, a U.S. Senate bill is aiming to protect areas where communities are most vulnerable to fires, using “good neighbor” agreements, cross-boundary collaboration and the expansion of tools to prevent fire hazards.
The bill, titled the Fix Our Forests Act, was introduced Thursday by Sens. John Curtis, R-Utah, John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., Tim Sheehy R-Mont., and Alex Padilla D-Calif. to “combat catastrophic wildfires, restore forest ecosystems, and make federal forest management more efficient and responsive,” according to a news release.

“After months of bipartisan cooperation and consensus-building, my colleagues and I are introducing comprehensive legislation to support forest health, accelerate restoration, and equip local leaders — from fire chiefs to mayors — with the tools and data they need to protect lives, property, and landscapes,” Curtis said in the release. 
The U.S. House version of the bill, sponsored by Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., passed the House in January. The legislation designates the top 20% of the landscape areas where wildfires are likely to spread and impact communities, including tribal areas, as so-called Fireshed Management Areas. The areas would be selected based on factors including risks to communities and to municipal watersheds.
It would also establish the Wildfire Intelligence Center, an office within the U.S. departments of Agriculture and Interior, which would work like the National Weather Service, a sort of “national hub for wildfire intelligence, prediction, coordination, and response,” according to a summary of the bill.
However, environmental advocates worry that the bill would “stifle citizen voices, remove science from land management decisions, and facilitate a large-scale rollback of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), National Historic Preservation Act, and National Environmental Policy Act on millions of acres of federal land,” according to a news release from Earthjustice.
Blaine Miller-McFeeley, senior legislative representative at Earthjustice, said the proposal doesn’t invest in proven wildfire prevention. Instead of funding and staffing key agencies, it “would codify the Trump administration’s attacks on our national forests and open the door for the timber industry to recklessly log our forests under the guise of forest management,” Miller McFeeley said in the release.
The bill includes easing some regulations to control vegetation on federal lands, allowing electric utilities with permits on National Forest System or Bureau of Land Management land to remove vegetation near power lines without requiring a separate timber sale. And, it propels advancing innovations on biochar, a carbonized biomass that according to a Utah State University article, has the potential to moderate wildfires and limit the amount of greenhouse gases released when hazardous fuels burn.
Utah expected to spend almost $12 million fighting wildfires this year

According to the environmentalists — who have also criticized the Trump administration’s executive order proposing expanding timber production on public lands —  the senators’ bill would “open millions of acres of federal land to logging without scientific review and community input — potentially increasing the risk of wildfires.”
Additionally, the bill also contains provisions to expand the country’s toolkit to reduce wildfire risk, and other actions to restore forestry, such as extending the time of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003, a stewardship contract, from 10 years to 20. It also raises the cap on Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program awards from $4 million to $8 million.
Beyond wildfire prevention and forestry management, the legislation would ensure federal assistance for firefighters who are injured or killed in the line of duty, offering a program to help their next of kin with notifications, travel reimbursement, case management for survivors and centralized access to benefits.  
The proposal comes after the Utah Wildfire Annual Report indicated a 54% increase of wildfires over a year. Nationwide that spike was of 231%, with nearly 9 million acres burning in 2024.
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox expressed support for the legislation, arguing that decades of reduced forest management have left the country with unhealthy, overgrown forests that are more vulnerable to catastrophic wildfires. He also referred to a provision from the bill directing the secretaries in charge of the program to evaluate opportunities to establish wildfire-resistant structures and communities using different materials, including mass timber.
“The Fix Our Forests Act, along with the tools provided by President Trump’s executive order, will help us actively manage our forests — protecting our watersheds, improving wildlife habitat, reducing wildfire risk, and providing the timber we need to build strong homes and neighborhoods,” Cox said in the release.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”


Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.
From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

Kennedy Jr. have pledged to “make America healthy again.” If Congress wants to actually take a step in that direction, it should pass legislation that would allow Medicare to finally offer coverage for anti-obesity medications.
Right now, our Medicare system is operating on regulations that are more than two decades old that specifically block coverage for anti-obesity medications, allowing only counseling or bariatric surgery in very specific circumstances.
Blocking coverage for amphetamines made sense when those were the only option. However, in the years since these regulations were introduced we have not only gained access to anti-obesity medications with a proven track record, we have also learned more about obesity and its effect on our nation.
Our current regulations are the equivalent of a “wait and see” approach, not taking the disease seriously until other health problems arise as a result.  We need to take a more practical, proactive approach that reflects everything medicine has learned over the past two decades.
Obesity isn’t a personal choice, and it isn’t just a cosmetic issue. It is a chronic disease, and it is time for Medicare to treat it as such.
Choosing not to address obesity can contribute to other life-threatening health issues including diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure that can be much more difficult and more invasive to treat.
Before President Trump took office, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services promulgated a rule that would finally allow anti-obesity medications.  I am disappointed to see that this rule was rescinded, and I call on Congress to take up the task and pass legislation that will allow Medicare patients to access anti-obesity medications, modernizing our approach to obesity and helping people across the nation get the treatment they need.
This will be particularly important for Missouri, where our obesity rate is 37%, the 16th highest in the nation.
One-third of our state’s seniors are obese, putting them at risk of significant health issues that can be much more expensive and burdensome to deal with.  Allowing Medicare to cover anti-obesity medications can ensure seniors are able to treat this disease before it leads to even bigger problems.
The savings from coverage of anti-obesity medications could be massive, as treating obesity can help avoid costlier diseases down the line.  This is a huge benefit to taxpayers that will also improve the quality of life for millions of Americans. I would strongly encourage our congressional delegation to support legislation that will allow patients to access these medications.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ozempic1731962374.jpg,,,2025-04-11 08:05:06.308877

Erin Grall sponsored Florida's tight abortion restriction and now wants to allow wrongful-death claims for fetal death. (Photo via Ron DeSantis Facebook page)This Florida Legislature continues its all-out attack on reproductive freedom. A near-total ban was not far enough for this extreme anti-abortion Legislature.
Although the majority of Floridians — 57% — voted to limit government interference with abortion, Florida’s extreme anti-abortion politicians are ignoring the will of the people and seeking to further restrict abortion access in Florida. Now they are seeking to open the door to civil lawsuits for money damages against doctors — and even the friends, family, and clergy members who help individuals seeking abortion care obtain the care they need.
Senate Bill 1284, by Sen. Erin Grall, and its House companion, HB 1517, by Rep. Sam Greco, purport to be about ensuring that grieving expectant mothers injured by a third party can recover for their loss of pregnancy. However, this type of recovery already exists under current law. (See Tanner v. Hartog, 696 So.2d 705 (1997)). This bill is unnecessary for that stated purpose.
The Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice approved the bill on Thursday, the second committee to do so. Its next stop, if taken up, will be the Senate Rules Committee. The legislation has already cleared the House. 
So, what are these bills really about?
You guessed it: abortion. These bills will make it harder for pregnant patients to access abortions by threatening their healthcare providers and support systems with civil lawsuits for damages. These are not hypothetical situations — we have seen dangerous wrongful death cases like these brought in Texas and Arizona. In Texas, a man sued three friends of his now ex-wife for $1 million each for helping his then-wife access abortion pills. In Arizona, a man accompanied his former wife to her abortion appointment, then, two years later following their divorce, filed a wrongful death suit against the clinic.
It is worth noting that this bill’s Senate sponsor is the same senator who brought us the extreme six-week abortion ban and who has made clear her opposition to abortion.
These deceptive bills make it more difficult for Floridians to access the care they need by threatening litigation against loved ones and healthcare providers. They incentivize and encourage civil lawsuits for money damages for abortions against doctors providing essential health care and against the friends, family members, and support systems who help their loved ones access the care they need. This could lead to doctors denying necessary healthcare and delaying treatment for pregnancy complications.
Additionally, the threat of having to defend against lawsuits and having to pay money damages will likely result in fewer OB/GYNs willing to practice in Florida or provide care to Floridians. As more and more OB/GYNs leave Florida for states where they are not subject to civil lawsuits, the quality of prenatal care in Florida will suffer.
Because these bills also encourage lawsuits against the friends, family, and support systems of pregnant Floridians, they will result in pregnant patients being more isolated and afraid to seek help from friends and family members for fear of exposing them to potential lawsuits.
‘Any stage of development’
Under these bills, civil lawsuits for damages could be brought by any person who impregnates someone else, including an abusive ex-partner, a rapist, or an uncommitted partner. Additionally, the bills would broadly define “unborn child” as including “any stage of development,” thus treating a fertilized egg the same as an actual child.
In the vast majority of states that allow for similar wrongful death lawsuits, the “unborn child” must have reached the developmental stage of viability in order to bring a wrongful death action. This overly broad bill would allow for wrongful death civil lawsuits with regard to fertilized eggs and embryos.
The bill sponsors disingenuously claim that these bills are necessary to support grieving families, but current law already allows expectant parents to seek compensation for their pain and suffering after the loss of a pregnancy. Do not let yourselves be duped. If these bills have nothing to do with restricting abortion access, the bill sponsor would simply amend the bill to state that “no cause of action shall be brought against anyone in connection with an abortion.”
The devastating impact of these bills on abortion access in Florida is clear. Treating fertilized eggs the same as actual human beings could lead to dangerous cascading restrictions on fertility services like IVF, as well as patient access to emergency care and cancer treatments.
Anti-abortion politicians aren’t satisfied with criminalizing abortion after six weeks. They won’t stop until they abolish all access to abortion and there are no OB/GYNs left in the state to provide such care.

Greg Porter, House Democrats' finance lead,  delivers remarks to reporters on the Republican-led passage of a massive local tax plan. Porter and his caucus held a news conference, featuring bright red and orange signs, after the House adjourned on Thursday, April 10, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A gargantuan local property and income tax plan — alternately dubbed a “great win” by Republicans and a “scam” by Democrats — cleared the Indiana House of Representatives on Thursday. The 65-29 vote was decided largely along party lines.
It came a day after lawmakers made sweeping edits with Gov. Mike Braun’s blessing. And the Senate appears poised to consent to the changes.
“SB1 offers meaningful tax relief for Hoosiers. The plan to CUT, CAP, and REFORM means relief now and systemic changes for the future to protect taxpayers,” Braun posted on social media. “Thank you to the House for their hard work and I look forward to the Senate sending this to my desk for signature next week!”
Senate Bill 1 would save homeowners a collective $1.2 billion in property taxes over three calendar years, from 2026 through 2028, according to a Thursday fiscal analysis. It does so largely by creating a credit for 10% off every homestead’s bill, up to $300 each.
Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, dubbed it a “great win for Hoosier taxpayers” Thursday.
Thompson, the House GOP caucus’ tax and budget head, said about two-thirds of homeowners would pay less in 2026 than this year under the overhauled legislation.
But local units of government would lose a projected $1.5 billion over the three years, per the analysis. Public school corporations alone represent about half the loss, at $744 million — although Democrats contend other tax changes push that figure to almost $800 million.
“It’s a loser for schools,” Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis, told the chamber.

In comments to reporters Thursday, House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, noted that estimates for local government losses are based on projected revenue. He urged greater focus on year-over-year collections.
“I’m going to push back on everybody that says, ‘Well, we would have collected ‘x.” Before you say it’s a cut, what did you collect last year? And what are you collecting this year? And then tell me what the numbers are,” Huston concluded.
Local income tax turmoil entraps governor
House Democrats accused their GOP colleagues of strong-arming local units of governments into raising local income taxes to make up property tax revenue losses.
The legislation caps total local income tax rates for all counties to 2.9%, down from 3.75%. Municipalities would be authorized to impose rates up to 1.2% within that county total — a tool they have not had before. Under current law, they have to get county officials on board to nab a local income tax.
“This plan is a trick. It’s a scam. It presumes Hoosiers can’t understand that 2.9% of their income is a lot more money than a $300 property tax credit,” House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, told reporters during a Thursday news conference.
“Statehouse Republicans are telling you they are cutting property taxes so they can score political points,” he continued. “But let me tell you the truth … They’re forcing our local servants to take the heat for raising your taxes.”
Rep. Mike Andrade, D-Munster, called the measure “a bait and switch” in which “local governments are left with no choice but to raise income taxes or slash critical services to subsidize the revenue loss.”
Thompson pushed back, noting the new, lower cap actually “slashes” untapped local income tax capacity from $5 billion to $3 billion. That didn’t satisfy Democrats.
Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, said it still would allow local governments to hike income taxes by three times more than what homeowners would save in property taxes.

“I don’t think that would happen,” he said of locals. “But, Braun math says (that) if I save you a nickel in your left pocket, I can take 15 nickels out of your right pocket.”
House Speaker Todd Huston offered vehement defense in a rare speech from the floor.
“The idea that this is a bait-and-switch is comical … because at the end of the day … we are providing taxpayer relief. We are,” Huston told his colleagues.
The local income tax furor appeared to trouble Braun.
“I have heard from several Hoosiers since my property tax deal was announced yesterday who are concerned about the local income tax provisions in the bill. Let me be clear,” he wrote in a Thursday morning social media post. “I agreed to a deal that delivers meaningful property tax cuts … and cuts the total local income tax rate by 23% from 3.75% to 2.9%.”
Although Braun wrote he “trust(ed)” that’s what was in the massive amendment approved Wednesday, his team was still examining the document “line by line to verify all of the language matches the deal.”
“If we find errors or it doesn’t do what I agreed to then I am confident the House and Senate will make needed edits to honor the deal before I allow it to become law,” he added.
Asked if there was confusion over what was in the deal, Huston told reporters, “There’s no confusion on my end. We’ve laid out all along what was in the bill.”
Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, representing cities and towns, indicated such hikes could come.
“We are glad there is targeted relief for property taxpayers, but this comes with the likelihood of significant cuts to the property tax base that will need to be evaluated in the coming years,” CEO Matt Greller said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “In communities where it makes sense, and the determination is made that additional local option income tax capacity would be adequate to recover lost funding, we are happy to see the decision to do so granted to municipal government.”
Other Hoosiers also save
Fixed-income seniors would get an additional $150 discount off their property tax bills stacked atop the $300 maximum available to the general population. Disabled veterans could also qualify for stackable credits of $150 and $250.
In exchange, lawmakers nixed assessed-value based deductions for both populations.

“This is a win for disabled veterans, moving to a credit,” Huston told reporters. “There are a lot of people — if you’re at the cap, you don’t even get the benefit of the deduction. This gives you a credit right off the bottom of your tax bill.”
His colleagues also said that modest per-person savings are still meaningful.
“I have heard some people say that an extra $200 or $300, or $500 or $700, is not worth lowering property taxes,” said Rep. Becky Cash, R-Zionsville. “We know that’s not true,” she said, citing how hard public retirees have fought to win a pension benefit bonus that may be worth less.
“This bill may not go far enough, but it does offer some relief,” Cash added. “The people’s money belongs to the people, and I cannot, in good conscience, keep one extra dollar from a family.”
Democrats, however, critiqued the measure for not providing direct relief to tenants, who pay property taxes indirectly via rent.
“This $300 credit, they’re not going to get it. Their landlords may get it, but does anybody here think the landlords want to pass that on to their renters?” asked Rep. Sue Errington, D-Muncie.
Senate Bill 1 also commands the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance to develop a property tax transparency portal by 2026. The portal would let Hoosiers provide feedback and compare their current liabilities to what they’d owe “based on changes under a proposed tax rate.”
Other taxpayers would get relief too, according to the analysis.
Over three years, it would cut property taxes by about $25 million for apartments, almost $69 million for other residential properties, $116 million on farmland and $145 million on personal property. But bills for agricultural business and other real properties would rise by $63 million and $720 million, respectively.

That adds up to about $802 million in savings across other property types.
The overhauled legislation additionally phases in a major increase in the acquisition cost threshold for the business personal property tax exemption — from $80,000 to $2 million — and narrows application of the 30% depreciation floor. It previously would’ve phased the tax itself out by 2030 on anything purchased this year or later.
“This is a smart, pro-growth reform that will reduce compliance burdens and unlock investment across Indiana,” said Vanessa Green Sinders, the president and CEO of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, in a news release. She added that the changes “directly benefits small- and medium-sized business owners in every corner of the state.”
Four lawmakers defected from their parties in the vote: Republican Reps. Craig Haggard, Andrew Ireland and Ethan Manning voted in opposition, while Democratic Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser voted in support.
Senate Bill 1 next returns to the Senate for either a tidy concurrence with the House overhaul — one was already filed Thursday — or to set up complex negotiations over a final version of the legislation. Senators could vote to approve the concurrence as soon as Monday, although they could also back choose to dissent instead.
“Our caucus members have (been) looking at some runs and making sure they understand how it affects their local communities, and so we’ll continue to talk about that over the weekend,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray told reporters.
“But it is our strong hope that we’ll be able to concur on that,” Bray, R-Martinsville, added.

And the end of session is hands-down my least favorite.
That’s because for months, the General Assembly has chugged along at a reasonable pace, hearing bills, listening to Hoosiers, making changes, passing measures — even compromising a time or two.
And then we hit the final few weeks, and all best practices go out the door.
I’m going to lay out three examples we have seen in recent days that don’t bode well for a transparent and accountable legislature. It’s also why trust in public service continues to erode.
First: The (now massive) property tax measure
Senate Bill 1 was 46 pages when introduced as Gov. Mike Braun’s reset plan to help homeowners. It grew under Senate Republicans to 91 pages. And after House Republicans added another amendment, it is a stunning 355 pages.
The GOP folded in tangentially related and even unrelated bills (possibly to harvest votes). And it made the product so endlessly complicated that even someone who has covered Indiana’s property tax system since it was redesigned after being found unconstitutional is struggling to grasp it all.
Governor gets more savings for homeowners in amended property tax proposal

It now includes a bill that had been moving just fine on its own – Senate Bill 518 – and looked like an easy win for the GOP. It provides property tax sharing in some local school districts for public charter schools. It’s a perfectly good debate to have on its own but now the measure is in this bill, which means Democrats didn’t support it.
The newly amended version had long sought business tax break in a phaseout of the business personal property tax cut. This came even though the purpose of the bill was long said to be about giving homeowners relief from massive assessment and bill spikes. Cooler heads prevailed on second-reading, though, and the elimination was removed.
Oh yeah, and it also dissolves a school corporation in southern Indiana has almost all virtual students, which has nothing to do with the original bill.
Heck, the bill isn’t even titled property tax relief anymore. It’s now local government finance.
Second: Reviving things that already failed once due to lack of support.
In the first half of session, House Bill 1662 had robust hearings, passed out of committee and then died on the calendar because it didn’t have the votes. The bill has been labeled by critics as criminalizing homelessness but proponents say it’s about squatters.
Now at this late hour, it was suddenly put into Senate Bill 197 via an amendment. No one following the issue had notice of the amendment so there was no public testimony. And it is likely headed back to the Senate to see if they “concur” or accept that change. Mind you, senators haven’t heard one iota of testimony on the concept.
Third: Brand new language.
We’re in the fourth month, and yet still introducing language that has never passed a committee. Several bills filed at the outset were bans on advertising marijuana. None of them had a committee vote in the first half.
Marijuana billboard ban, towing rules stripped from Senate’s BMV bill, but advance in House

Instead, a Republican lawmaker added it to a BMV bill he authored while it was in a Senate committee. The agency was none too pleased, and the language was removed the next week. But never fear, the language was added again – this time to Senate Bill 73 on utility trailer sales. The language hasn’t passed a single chamber, and most lawmakers have heard no testimony on the pros and cons of such a move. But it could very well become law anyway.
Yes, the session isn’t over yet. And every day counts. But leaders can’t be happy with some of the shenanigans that are just considered to be ho-hum legislating. For the majority of session, decorum prevails.
But when the end nears, everyone suddenly forgets that it matters just as much how a law is passed as what is passed. And that’s why the end of session will always be the worst time of year.

(Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, recently stepped down from the ethics subcommittee after the Reformer reported he steered millions in public funds to a legal client.
Champion maintains the work was pro-bono, and that it concluded just before the start of the legislative session during which he spearheaded $3 million in state grants to a nonprofit run by his client Jerry McAfee. (McAfee refused to say whether he’d paid Champion for the legal work, but has since told other media it was indeed pro-bono.) Ethics experts have told the Reformer and other news outlets that Champion’s actions constitute a conflict of interest even if they didn’t technically violate Senate rules or Minnesota law.
Minnesota court records indicate McAfee wasn’t the only legal client to benefit from Champion’s grantmaking: In 2024, he provided legal representation for a Minneapolis-based substance abuse treatment provider, Turning Point. 
The prior year, Champion spearheaded a successful effort to direct $1 million in public funds to the organization for improving their facility.
Champion says he was not compensated for his legal representation of Turning Point, and that he was involved in the case only briefly.
The circumstances of that relationship are somewhat different from his work for McAfee’s group. Champion wasn’t retained to represent Turning Point until after the legislative session in which he directed money toward the nonprofit, meaning that at the time of that session there was no potential conflict of interest to disclose to his colleagues or the public.
But the case nevertheless illustrates how professional entanglements can make lawmaker-directed grants an ethics minefield, which is why some lawmakers are now seeking to curtail the practice.
A facility in disrepair
In February 2023, Champion introduced and was the sole Senate author on a bill allocating $2 million to Turning Point to “design, construct, furnish, and equip improvements and betterments of a capital nature to Turning Point’s facility in the city of Minneapolis.”
At a Capital Investment Committee hearing held on March 21 of that year, Champion sat next to Turning Point’s then-CFO Lori Wilson and explained to lawmakers that the money was necessary because the nonprofit’s facility was falling into disrepair.
“They’ve had extensive water damage due to settling of the building,” Champion said. “Rotting pillars, the wood has never been treated. The cooling and heating system has insufficient zoning. Windows, you name it.”
That bill was ultimately rolled into HF 670, the omnibus capital investment bill, with a final dollar amount of $1 million granted to Turning Point. It was finalized in May, and signed by Gov. Tim Walz on June 1.
An allegation of negligence, and a lawsuit
The apparent disrepair was a factor in a lawsuit filed against Turning Point by a former client in October of that year. The former client alleged that Turning Point “carelessly and negligently allowed the premises to be in an unsafe condition causing the ceiling to fall down on Plaintiff’s head and body causing injury” while he was staying at their facility.
Through a spokesman, Champion said that Turning Point reached out to him for legal advice in November. “I later filed a response on behalf of Turning Point and advised that they submit a claim through their insurance and seek counsel through that method, which they subsequently did, ending my involvement with the matter,” he said.
Champion filed Turning Point’s answer to the lawsuit on Feb. 18 2024, denying the allegations and accusing Turning Point’s former client of owing the organization more than $3,500 in past-due rent. On May 24, court documents indicate Turning Point replaced him with a different lawyer.
“In the short time during which I advised and represented Turning Point, I was not paid,” Champion said. “The capital investment request they brought to the Capitol stated that they had repair needs at their facilities, and the incident in their housing later that year proved these needs and their request for state support was worthy.”
Champion represented McAfee on another case
The Reformer’s review of court records turned up another, not previously reported court case where Champion provided legal services to Rev. Jerry McAfee. In 2012, he represented McAfee’s New Salem Missionary Baptist church in a lawsuit filed by a creditor, Foundation Capital Resources Inc. Champion was a member of the Minnesota House at the time. 
Because that case was filed prior to 2015, there is only limited information available for it on the Minnesota Judicial Branch website.
Champion said that like his later work for McAfee’s nonprofit, he was not compensated for this case: “As part of my role as an attorney in the community, I have made myself available to churches when they need legal advice or representation, and it is a practice of mine not to charge churches.”
A light touch on ethics rules
Under Minnesota law, legislative conflicts of interest are narrowly defined. According to a Minnesota Senate summary, a conflict exists only when a Senator makes an official action on “a matter which will substantially affect the Senator’s financial interests or those of an associated business.” 
Non-compensated work, like pro-bono legal services, does not meet that threshold. Nor would paid work concluded prior to a legislative session, or initiated after.
The situation is complicated by Minnesota’s part-time Legislature, when most lawmakers need to earn a living beyond their $51,750 legislative salary.
Outside ethics experts have said that Minnesota’s conflict of interest laws are among the weakest in the nation. A 2015 Center for Public Integrity report, for instance, found that Minnesota ranked 44th in the nation on legislative accountability.
Beyond Minnesota’s strict legal definition, conflicts of interest can take many forms. As an attorney, Champion’s legal work leaves a paper trail in the court system. But work that lawmakers in other professions do on behalf of their clients is less subject to public scrutiny.
That opacity is why the practice of allowing lawmakers to steer money directly to favored nonprofits is coming under heightened criticism. 
On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy told reporters Champion made the right decision by asking the ethics subcommittee to issue an opinion on his potential conflicts of interest, and that the Senate rules aren’t in line with what the general public sometimes considers to be a conflict.
“It is time for us to take a look again at what we mean as a standard on the conflict of interest, so members doing good work for the people of Minnesota don’t get caught in that gray area,” Murphy said.
Asked if he ever provided legal representation to any other individuals or organizations that he has authored bills to provide grant funding for, Champion had a succinct answer: “No.”

Raj Mukherji speaks at a rally in Trenton on Sept. 30, 2024, in support of the Climate Superfund Act, which would require fossil fuel firms to pay for economic damages borne of climate change. (Courtesy of Food & Water Watch)I have spent the last 10 years working with thousands of wonderful health professionals in New Jersey and across the country who are speaking out about climate change and health.
One problem most people recognize is the obvious (and predicted) increase in the frequency and severity of flooding, wildfires, and heat waves. Lately, medical colleagues from the Carolinas to California tell us stories about how flooding and wildfires are slamming their patients.
Over the years, I have heard too many stories about people hurt in storms, children with asthma suffering severe respiratory effects from wildfire smoke, and older people having heart attacks brought on by heat waves — three among many more frightening, sometimes deadly, predicted health impacts. From Hurricane Sandy to the wildfire smoke of 2023, it’s abundantly clear that New Jersey will also not escape the reality of climate science.
Unfortunately, there is a second category of major health concern here. Public health professionals focus on the phrase “social determinants of health.”  These are defined as: “the conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect virtually all health and quality-of life outcomes.” The most obvious examples are, again, the severe weather events that tear up roads and bridges, prevent the shipment and delivery of goods, overrun our water treatment plants, destroy farmers’ fields, wipe out crops, and on and on. The full costs imposed on society for all this — including medical costs — are going through the roof.
The nexus of economic loss and damage to the social determinants of health is irrefutably growing. If you don’t believe that idea is true, consider the cost to protect your home. Across this country, home insurance costs are skyrocketing. Big insurers like State Farm, Allstate, and Farmers are no longer offering home insurance in entire states. This problem is spreading quickly, including in New Jersey. The physicians, nurses, veterinarians, and other health professionals within Clinicians for Climate Action New Jersey have front-row seats to this slowly unfolding crisis. In these seats, you can’t miss that the cost to New Jerseyans will be beyond staggering.
Meanwhile, as countless court cases are demonstrating, including from New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, fossil fuel companies have understood for decades the harm their products would do to the environment, leading to these devastating health harms. The fossil fuel industry misled the public, denied the realities of climate change, and obstructed efforts to decrease its impact. At the same time, fossil fuel companies continue to bring in record profits. The CEO of Chevron said, “In 2023, we returned more cash to shareholders and produced more oil and natural gas than any year in the company’s history.”
What can New Jersey do? Last year, New Jersey legislators began to consider a new idea: the creation of a “Climate Superfund.” This initiative mirrors laws that have passed in New York and Vermont, with other states on the same path. The idea is simple: Given the vast costs that New Jersey has spent already on climate change damage, it is only fair that fossil fuel companies share those costs. Funds collected by the state would be spent on essential climate resilience projects, including infrastructure improvements, disaster preparedness, health initiatives, and more. This is a fair, commonsense step toward protecting our state’s financial stability and the health of our communities. This is taxpayer relief.
Beloved New Jersey baseball icon Yogi Berra once said, “The future ain’t what it used to be.” He was right. If we don’t stick to our commitments, our children and grandchildren will rightfully resent the future we are leaving them.
New Jersey was a leader in passing the Spill Act in 1976 to hold polluters responsible for toxic pollution sites, which led to the passage of the national Superfund program. A generation later, it’s time for New Jersey to lead to hold climate polluters accountable.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)One in four Wisconsin child care providers could close their doors if the state’s ongoing support isn’t replaced after it ends in June, according to a state-commissioned report released Thursday.
More than one in three providers expect to reduce their capacity for children or the hours they operate, or both, according to the report, based on a survey of most of the state’s licensed child care providers.
The report was commissioned by the state Department of Children and Families (DCF) and produced by the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
It was released by the office of Gov. Tony Evers to support $480 million for child care providers in his 2025-27 proposed budget — a successor to the state’s Child Care Counts program that was funded with federal pandemic relief money.

“It underscores what those of us in the field have known for a long time — that is, the need for public investment in order to stave off closures and rate increases,” said Ruth Schmidt, executive director of the Wisconsin Early Childhood Association.
The association supports Evers’ $480 million budget proposal and is holding an advocacy day at the state Capitol on April 16, with plans to meet lawmakers.
In a statement announcing the survey findings, Evers underscored his proposal.
“The cost of child care is too darn high, wait lists are too long, and providers are already struggling to keep the lights on, their doors open, and meet demand for child care across our state,” Evers said.
“The results of this survey are crystal clear: if we don’t make needed investments to support our child care providers and industry, programs will close, wait lists will get even longer, providers will be forced to raise prices, and parents and loved ones who can’t afford for [their] costs to get any higher may have to leave our workforce.”
Child Care Counts has provided monthly payments to state child care providers since 2021. From November 2021 to January 2024, it was funded from Wisconsin’s share of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the federal pandemic relief legislation enacted in 2021. The program paid out more than $479 million to providers. After that money ran out, Evers directed another $170 million additional pandemic relief funds to carry the program through June 2025.
Child Care Counts paid out $20 million a month until mid-2023, when it was cut to $10 million a month, with providers getting half of what they had previously received.
The Republican majority in the state Legislature rejected Evers’ proposal to put up to $360 million in the 2023-25 budget to continue the subsidy program at its earlier monthly amount.
Providers have credited the Child Care Counts program with making it possible for them to increase pay for child care workers in the face of competition from other employers without being forced to raise the fees they charge parents.  
About 80% of the state’s more than 4,500 child care providers received and took part in the survey, which was included in providers’ November application for Child Care Counts payments.
The survey included questions about providers’ experiences before and after the Child Care Counts reduction. It also asked about their expectations after the program ends in June, as well as the potential impact of a continued program.
Two-thirds of providers surveyed reported that after the payments were reduced, they raised fees.
Responding to questions about the impact of state support ending in June, 25% or more of providers in the survey said they would be somewhat or more likely to close. Fully 10% of providers said closing their program “was very or extremely likely,” the report found.
“That’s an incredibly concerning statistic,” said Schmidt. “That’s a lot of child care programs that could be pulling up stakes. It’s going to hit rural communities super hard, but across the state we’re going to see significant closures.”
More than one-third of providers — 37% — said they were “at least somewhat likely” to close some of their classrooms or reduce the number of children they serve. Almost that many, 36%, said they were likely to reduce the number of hours they provide care.
By 59%, providers also expect their waiting lists to grow without continued state support.
Providers also expect to have a harder time hiring and keeping employees, with 66% saying that it was “at least somewhat likely” they will have to cut compensation, including their own. Fully half of providers “said this was very or extremely likely,” the report states.
More than half of providers — 56% — said it was at least somewhat likely that more employees would quit, and 46% said staff cuts were somewhat or more likely.
Of providers in the survey, 69% said “that it was at least somewhat likely” they would have a harder time hiring qualified employees.
About half of providers surveyed — 51% — said they thought it would be “at least somewhat likely” that they would find it harder to provide high quality care.
Between one-fourth and nearly half of providers said they expected to have more trouble being able to meet some parents’ specific needs. Those include providing care earlier or later in the day, serving families in the state’s Wisconsin Shares subsidy child care program for low-income families, caring for infants and toddlers or caring for children with special needs.
“With families already struggling to afford child care, respondents repeatedly described how continued funding — whether at the original or at current levels—would help prevent further tuition rate increases,” the survey report notes. Some providers said it would allow them to hold rates at their current level or reduce them, while others said it would keep the rate of tuition increases down.
Corrine Hendrickson, a New Glarus child care provider and organizer of an advocacy group for providers and families, Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), said the survey points out “the disastrous results for children and families after the initial [Child Care Counts] funding wasn’t replaced in the state budget.”
Rural areas, where families are younger and have lower incomes, may be hit the most dramatically if the child care sector contracts, Hendrickson said.
Hendrickson said she is likely to have to raise the rates she charges for her family child care center, which has a capacity of eight children. A $30 increase “will put me out of reach for too many families,” Hendrickson said. “If I lose two children and can’t replace them within a month or two, I will have to close.”

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette) SUMMERVILLE — A longtime Democratic solicitor announced he is switching to the Republican Party, which comes as he mulls a run for attorney general.
David Pascoe, the chief prosecutor for Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg counties, told a crowd of around 60 people that he “can no longer in good conscience wear the label Democrat.”
After his 10-plus minute speech that was preceded by praise from a Republican legislator, sheriff and another solicitor, Pascoe confirmed to reporters that he is contemplating a bid for attorney general.
“I’m strongly considering a run,” he said outside the Summerville Country Club. “Having seen what goes on in Columbia … and seeing what goes on there today motivates me.”
Pascoe is the first to publicly say he’s considering a bid for the statewide office expected to be wide open for the first time in 16 years.
Republican Alan Wilson, first elected attorney general in 2010, has said he’s seriously considering a run for governor, meaning he’ll likely be vacating the seat.
Pascoe said Wilson’s decision will have no bearing on whether or not he runs to replace him.
“When I make a decision to do something, it’s never based on somebody else. It’s based on what I want,” he said.
Pascoe, first elected solicitor in 2004, has gained bipartisan respect over the last two decades.
In 2014, it was Wilson who handed Pascoe a case he expanded into the largest Statehouse corruption investigation since the FBI’s Operation Lost Trust. That 1990s case resulted in 27 convictions, including 17 legislators and seven lobbyists.
The probe broadened by Pascoe — despite Wilson’s attempt to fire him — ultimately brought down a GOP powerbroker and six Republican legislators, though only one went to prison as a result of Pascoe’s investigation.
Others resigned as part of plea deals, received probation and paid fines in the prosecution completed by another solicitor after the state Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that Pascoe had exceeded his authority.
“They violated our public trust,” Pascoe said Thursday. “They deserved to be removed from office and face the repercussions that they got.”
Pascoe said corruption and selfish representation continues at the Statehouse by legislators from both parties.
In explaining his decision to switch allegiances, Pascoe said being a Democrat hadn’t felt “like home” in a long time.
He didn’t desert the party; it deserted him, he told potential GOP primary voters at the Dorchester County Republican Party meeting.
Characterizing himself as a tough-on-crime prosecutor who supports Second Amendment gun rights and opposes abortion, Pascoe said he could no longer support a party that stood for the opposite.
Yet, Pascoe endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 and even made the eventual president the special guest at his annual oyster roast in January of that year.
When asked by reporters about that endorsement, Pascoe said Biden assured him ahead of time that he appreciated “hard-nosed prosecutors” like him. Pascoe says he later learned that was a false claim.
It was on Dec. 23 — when Biden commuted 37 federal death penalty sentences to life in prison — that Pascoe said he knew he needed to change his allegiance.
“I cannot comprehend the disregard for victims and their feelings that has to go through another person’s heart or brain to have someone from the Department of Justice call those family members, loved ones, and tell them that the person that murdered their daughter, their loved one, their sister, their mother, is having their sentence commuted tomorrow,” Pascoe said.
He told the crowd he knew Democrats weren’t happy with him.
Minutes after his speech ended, state Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain released a statement alleging that Pascoe’s decision was made solely to help his chances for attorney general.
“Who are you fooling David? Do you think South Carolina Republicans are going to let a 20-year Democratic solicitor who suddenly has a change of heart be their nominee for attorney general?” the statement said.
“We trust his new political home will embrace his long-held Democratic values with the same enthusiasm — or at the very least, Google them,” she continued.
The statement ended by saying: “When the South Carolina GOP primary voters reject you in 2026, don’t expect the voters in Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg to allow you to keep your job.”
Pascoe’s announcement came one day before one of the men he prosecuted and sent to South Carolina’s death row, Mikal Mahdi, is set to be executed by firing squad.
SC Supreme Court declines to stop upcoming execution

Mahdi pled guilty to a pair of 2004 killings that were part of a multi-state crime spree.
After stealing a car and a gun in Virginia, Mahdi shot Christopher Boggs, a gas station clerk, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He continued south, where he carjacked a man in Columbia before fleeing to Calhoun County.
There, he shot Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers with his own gun, then set his body on fire and stole his police car.
Pascoe said Thursday he was asked by media at the time if he would cut a deal that would avoid the death penalty.
“I told them that I will show the same mercy for Mr. Mahdi that he showed his victims. None,” Pascoe said.
Pascoe was praised Thursday by other Republicans for his record of seeking justice.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)State legislation that would require the Wisconsin health department to verify that all Medicaid recipients are eligible twice a year was met with resounding opposition at a public hearing Thursday.
The bill, AB 163, also would add restrictions on the verification process. With a few differences, the legislation echoed a bill that failed to pass two years ago.
Only one witness testified in favor of the measure: its Assembly author, state Rep. William Penterman (R-Columbus).  
“It will create a balance, an important balance, in preserving a strong safety net for our most vulnerable residents while curbing inappropriate long-term reliance on public assistance,” Penterman said.
The legislation would prohibit the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) from renewing Medicaid recipients automatically and require DHS to reconsider a person’s eligibility every six months instead of annually, the federal standard.
It would cut off eligibility for six months for Medicaid recipients who don’t report a change, such as higher income, that would make them ineligible for the program. It also prescribes additional requirements for checking databases of other agencies to confirm information about a Medicaid recipient’s qualifications.
Over the course of a 2-1/2-hour hearing, witnesses said the bill would impose significant administrative burdens on Medicaid recipients and likely lead some to be kicked off the rolls, not because they were not eligible but because of mistakes, whether made by the recipient in the process of trying to requalify or by state officials processing their paperwork.
“Its reason seems to be purposely causing difficulty for people whose lives are already a monumental struggle in an attempt to make it too difficult for them to access the services they are entitled to,” said Karel Oliveras, who has two grandchildren with Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes developmental delays and other problems.
Referring to Oliveras’ comments about the process of establishing eligibility for the program, Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) asked, “Would you characterize it as too easy?”
“It’s my daughter and her husband who do that,” Oliveras said. “But the stress of that [on them] was very, very obvious.”
Both Clancy and Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire), the committee’s two Democrats, were skeptical about the idea that there were people in Wisconsin who were on Medicaid but didn’t qualify.
In response to lawmakers who had implied that Wisconsin’s Medicaid enrollment — about 20% of the state population — was excessive, Tamara Jackson, the legislative policy representative for the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities, said the percentage is similar in most states.   
According to Jackson, Wisconsin’s Medicaid staff already monitors people’s eligibility rigorously. “They are really checking every application and every renewal to make sure that people meet the income, asset, and other eligibility requirements,” she said.  
Chad Sobieck, who uses a wheelchair, said he has been on Medicaid for his entire life and it has enabled him to live in the community with the help of caregivers covered by the program. When completing paperwork, he has to enlist the help of others because he cannot write due to his physical disability, he said. 
A provision in the bill banning DHS from prepopulating forms for the renewal applicant would make that even more difficult.
If he has to qualify every six months and there’s an error that kicks him off  Medicaid for six months, “that would mean that I don’t have caregivers,” Sobiek said. “If there is a gap in those services, I will not be able to remain independent and it will become a safety and health issue for me.”
Almost all the opposition testimony focused on people with disabilities. Several Wisconsin Medicaid programs enable people with disabilities to live at home or in the community, rather than in an institution, with the program covering their needs for health care and home and personal care that they cannot manage on their own.
Wisconsin patients, families are wary as Congress prepares for Medicaid surgery

Penterman said that after “conversation and collaborating with the stakeholders” he was planning to offer an amendment that would exempt people with developmental disabilities from the legislation.
Critics of the bill, however — including those speaking on behalf of people with developmental disabilities — were largely skeptical about that announcement.
“I am a little offended about the fact that the amendment offered only covers the developmentally disabled,” said Jason Glozier, executive director of the Wisconsin Coalition of Independent Living Centers, arguing that the proposal’s limits would be onerous for people with physical disabilities, too.
“To say that doubling the administrative burden would decrease waste or decrease fraud doesn’t seem to make sense when we have a system that is overburdened and unable to meet its need effectively,” Glozier said.
“Why should somebody who’s been disabled from birth, who’s been paralyzed or acquired a disability, have to consistently re-insist that they have a disability?” he added. “It’s not going to get better.”

House Bill 364 sought to create the Department of Government Efficiency Legislative Task Force in Idaho, but it never made it to the floor of the Idaho Senate for a vote and died when the 2025 legislative session adjourned April 4.
Even though legislators couldn’t reach an agreement on the task force during the session, Rep. Jaron Crane, R-Nampa, issued a press release Thursday saying that Idaho House and Senate Republican leaders jointly announced the formation of the Idaho DOGE Task Force as part of a unified front. 
Crane serves as the House majority caucus chairman as part of the Republican leadership team.

“We have talked a lot about eliminating redundancy, cutting back on red tape, and the responsibility we have to prevent waste,” Crane said in a written statement Thursday. “Since 1974, there has been no reconstruction on Idaho’s government at all, that was under Gov. Cecil Andrus. That was the last time we looked at reorganizing the government and making it more efficient.”
According to Thursday’s announcement, the Idaho DOGE Task Force will have three areas of focus.

Government agency consolidation: Idaho Republican leaders said they will evaluate and implement strategies to merge redundant agencies and optimize services. 
Government employee travel: Republicans said they will review and reduce unnecessary state-funded travel in order to cut costs.
Eliminating unnecessary state government employee positions: Idaho Republicans said they are assessing and restructuring government roles to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent efficiently. 

“Idaho’s Legislative DOGE Committee is a significant move towards streamlining government operations and enhancing State efficiency,” House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said in a written statement provided by Crane.
Crane told the Sun the new DOGE Task Force will have public meetings, like a legislative interim committee or joint committee.
A date and location for the first meeting had yet to be announced Thursday. Crane said the next step is to populate the committee with members.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Bills throughout the Indiana Statehouse took on hefty rewrites Thursday as end-of-session deadlines loomed.
A health care measure now freezes certain hospital prices; 13th checks were stripped from Hoosier retirees, at least for now; and bipartisan changes were approved to other bills dealing with homelessness and college scholarships. A major road funding bill took new shape, as well.
Thursday marked the last day for bills to advance from committees. Floor amendments in both the House and Senate must be approved by end-of-day Monday in time for final chamber votes on Tuesday.
After that, any other bill negotiations will be hashed out in conference committees — largely behind closed doors — before the last week of April, when the legislature is required to wrap up.
Introducing a lengthy amendment, Sen. Chris Garten told the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which he sits, that the majority caucus would be pivoting away from the “price caps” under House Bill 1004 to a two-year price freeze for the state’s five largest nonprofit hospital systems. During the first year, analysts with the state’s Office of Management and Budget would conduct a hospital pricing study to provide an independent review.
By 2027, with a new average price benchmark identified, hospitals could then be penalized for exceeding that cost — similar to the original version that used a percentage of Medicare prices as its standard.

Accrued fees will be deposited into an account to offset the state’s Medicaid costs. By 2029, violators could lose their nonprofit, tax-exempt status.
“We’re creating a four-year runway. We’re trying to ease into this and we want to make sure we do this with the hospitals, and so there’s been an immense amount of collaboration on that part of it,” said Garten, R-Charlestown.
Additionally, the mandated physician reimbursement will now be 168% of the Medicare rate and hospitals directly contracting with employers, bypassing insurers, would have a price cap.
While the above portions “(try) to get hospitals back in line to help lower health care costs,” other parts “help hospitals,” Garten said, specifically rural health systems.
Insurers must disclose fees and commissions to clients in total dollars, not as a percentage, with potential consequences for noncompliance. Third party administrators will also have transparency requirements.
Rep. Martin Carbaugh, who authored the underlying bill, said that as an insurance broker himself, the disclosure “doesn’t scare me at all.”
“I think if you’re scared of disclosing how much you make, it might be part of the problem,” said Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne.
Hospitals will also be prohibited from contracting with insurers that don’t decouple their Medicare Advantage plans from commercial options — requiring separate negotiations.
“Right now, hospitals are taking a massive, massive loss on Medicare Advantage plans in their contract negotiations,” Garten said. “… I’ve heard from dozens of rural systems that said, ‘If we could get this done, it would be one of the largest helps.’”










I think if you’re scared of disclosing how much you make, it might be part of the problem.


– Rep. Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne


The bill retained language restructuring of the Hospital Assessment Fee to leverage larger reimbursements from the federal government.
But not everyone appreciated the changes.
“… We’re putting a price tax on only one industry in the state of Indiana (and) saying, ‘You can’t raise your prices for the next few years. It doesn’t matter what the environment is,’” said Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne. “‘It doesn’t matter if you have another pandemic. It doesn’t matter if the tariffs increase all the costs of services and goods that come into your hospital system — you can’t raise your prices for the next two years. Period.’”
Brown pointed to Congressional uncertainty, specifically around Medicaid. Federal dollars make up roughly one-third of the state’s Medicaid budget.
“I just can’t even fathom that we did this,” Brown said.
Brown joined three Democrats to oppose the bill. One Democrat, Sen. Lonnie Randolph of East Chicago, joined Republicans to advance the proposal.
Roads and retirees
Within a new, wide-reaching amendment to House Bill 1461, Rep. Jim Pressel’s road funding proposal, are changes to a debated wheel tax that would now allow some Hoosiers to be taxed twice. 
The Senate panel reverted the legislation to an earlier version, in which “stacked” wheel taxes can be imposed by cities or towns, as well as the county in which they’re located.
Language in the bill requires local governments to adopt a wheel tax to qualify for state grant funds, despite opposition from municipal officials.

The latest road funding draft also promises up to $50 million per year to Indianapolis “for use on secondary streets,” as long as the city matches those funds.
Brown questioned why taxpayers across the state should be burdened with maintaining Indianapolis’ roads “when our own communities are funding those things on our own.”
“Is that our problem to solve?” she asked. “For us to double down on this community … I’m kind of struggling. … We are rewarding them by giving them extra money.”
Pressel noted that Indianapolis “has a $680-million-a-year road funding problem. “And if we don’t help them and encourage them to spend their dollars correctly,” he said, “that problem is not going to go away on its own.”
“They are never going to be able to catch up — unless we want to take back roads, put that back under the state’s purview,” he continued. “I struggle with it too, but if we don’t take the initiative, I don’t know what else to do. … It’s our capital city, and we should help them move in the right direction.”
Also included are increased registration fees for electric vehicles from $150 to $340, and from $50 to $170 for hybrids. Baked in, too, is a provision to raise the speed limit on I-465, which circles Indianapolis, from 55 mph to 65 mph.

The bill advanced to the chamber floor in a 9-4 vote.
The Senate committee also struck out a four-year 13th check from House Bill 1221. The annual bonus check has been used in the past to help public sector retirees with increasing costs. 
But Senate budget leader Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, suggested that checks would be part of further budget discussions.
Earlier bill language ensured a two-year traditional 13th check for current retirees until an automatic 1% cost-of-living adjustment takes effect in 2027.
“While we’re disappointed the 13th check for the next two years is no longer included in HB 1221 because we were hoping to put this issue to bed early this year, we are optimistic that the 13th check will make it into the final version of the budget,”said Jessica Love, executive director of the Retired Indiana Public Employees Association.
Appropriations committee member Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute, said to “trust in the process.”
Love said Hoosier retirees are “trying to do the same.” For now, she said, supplemental reserve accounts “have more than enough funding” to cover the cost of 13th checks — ranging from $150 to $450 — through the biennium.
“Retirees continue to desperately need this type of benefit enhancement approved for the next two years, especially without a more meaningful or permanent solution in place,” Love added. “So, while the budget process is a complicated one, that fact should make the 13th check decision an easy one, and we look forward to a positive outcome by the end of session.”  
Other changes earn bipartisan support
In the House, Democrats begrudgingly offered amendments to compromise, at least somewhat, on two additional measures.
The first — a bill addressing homelessness — was softened to limit the instances when unhoused Hoosiers can be charged with a crime.
Provisions in Senate Bill 197 stipulate that “a person may not camp, sleep, or use for long term shelter a public right-of-way or public land unless authorized for that use by the state or political subdivision, as appropriate.”
Those who have not moved from a public right-of-way within 24 hours of a law enforcement officer’s warning — or from public land within 72 hours — could be arrested and charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail or a $500 fine.
Indiana House committee moves ‘more focused’ version of anti-DEI bill

Limitations were added Thursday, though, to require that a person refuse multiple forms of housing and other intervention services offered by law enforcement or crisis management teams before an arrest can be made.
The effective date on the proposal was additionally pushed back a year, to July 1, 2026, which Democratic Rep. Justin Moed said “will give communities, law enforcement, service providers, some more time to try to get ready and prepare for this new law.”
“This bill isn’t perfect, and there isn’t really a soundbite or a cute newspaper article that you can get out of this,” said Moed, of Indianapolis. “Life on the street is complicated, and the reasons that people are there are various — and the ways in which we can reach them is varied, as well. It’s easy to cast judgment, and it’s easy to imagine that if we were there, that we would choose some different way.”
“What we really need is more supportive services,” he continued. “We need more compassion.”
Scholarship eligibility changes were separately made within Senate Bill 289, a GOP-backed “anti-discrimination” measure.
The underlying bill prevents state-funded scholarships intended only for minority students, like the Next Generation Hoosier Educators Scholarship; the William A. Crawford minority teacher scholarship; and the Earline S. Rogers student teaching scholarship for minority students.
Rather than eliminate those awards altogether, lawmakers approved new requirements to allow all Hoosier students in five “underserved” areas — Allen, Marion, Lake County, St. Joseph and Vanderburgh counties — to apply.
Rep. Earl Harris Jr., D-East Chicago, said the amendment ensures that minority students would still have the opportunity to apply for those scholarships and other financial aid.
“In a perfect world, I wouldn’t be standing here offering this amendment,” Harris said. “Do I want to make changes to the scholarships that are named after three former legislators? No. But we’re in a position where the options are (either) those go away, or the option to take here, which is to modify them. … But we don’t want to cause hundreds of students to lose money, so this will at least keep something in place.”

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/11/lawmakers-fear-ai-data-centers-will-drive-up-residents-power-bills/,"The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, worries lawmakers.","Construction proceeds at a data center in Eagle Mountain, Utah, in 2021. Across the country, some state lawmakers are concerned that the growing data center industry is creating a surge in demand for new electricity and grid infrastructure. (George Frey/Getty Images)This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.










We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

During the rally, at least 50 people, including students, MSU faculty, and community members, gathered at 4 p.m. at the doors of the MSU administration building to demand answers and future actions regarding the revoked visas of MSU students, the university’s stance on divestment from Israel, and its position toward Trump administration policies.

“The point of education is to come to understand more about the world, more about history, and our relationship to the time we live in right now”, said Zadok Miller, 20, pre-law, political science, and English student. “So, for our institutions to remain neutral and not provide active support for students who are affected by fascism is very hypocritical.”
On April 7, the visas of several international MSU students were revoked by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security without any explanation. They were among the hundreds of visas revoked for international students across the country and dozens more across the state of Michigan.
It’s part of an effort by the Trump administration to revoke visas of foreign students who may have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism or protests, as well as those determined to have engaged in antisemitism through social media.
The Office for International Students and Scholars recommends that international students should have a plan B in case they need to complete their studies remotely and if they are unable to access their Student & Exchange Visitor Information System to verify their status.

As a result, on Wednesday, April 9, MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz issued a campus letter to MSU students, expressing his concern about the current situation and his commitment to ensuring a safe space for international students and scholars.
“I am in Washington, D.C. today, meeting with congressional leaders and speaking about these concerns and the anxiety our students and university community are experiencing”, wrote Guskiewicz in his letter.
Although Guskiewicz’s words somewhat pleased the rally attendees, they did not convince them about his stand.
“It was better than some other things he released in the past, but it lacks a clear plan of action to actually protect international students,” said Jesse Estrada White, 21, a Comparative Cultures and Policies student and member of the Hurriya coalition movement. “We are glad he was in Washington, but we want to see policy changes that will protect our international classmates.”
Chants such as “Not another nickel, not another dime, no more money for Israel’s crimes” and “This is what democracy looks like” were heard during the rally, which continued without incident, along with some speeches by students and the general public.
Around 5 p.m., a group of 14 students and members of the organizations engaged in a pre-arranged dialogue with the MSU Board of Trustees to clarify and address the demands these students brought to the table.
Among their demands, the students highlighted divestment from Israel, Saudi Arabia, and weapons manufacturers, adding social conscience back into investment policy, the creation of a Middle East North Africa/Arab Studies Institute, and protections for international students.

Before the demands were presented, the Board of Trustees was informed by the students that, while the conversation was taking place, some students were peacefully occupying the building and that the occupation would be lifted if an agreement was reached on the demands.
“No one in this room, and no one downstairs, wants to be in this position, but the reason for this meeting is not confrontation; it is by resolution. The occupation is the way to raise urgency and concern among our students”, said Nasim Barghouti, 21, President of SJP.
Trustee Dennis Denno stated that it is was if the trustees started with a gun to their heads
After clarifying the actions taken up to that point and the disagreements on the part of the board, Trustee Mike Balow stated, “The fact that we’re here is something, so let’s get started.”
The meeting lasted a little over an hour, with back-and-forth between both sides over the demands, but in the end, they did not reach an agreement.
Regarding international student protection, the demands from student organizations included: providing legal assistance for students in immigration or visa-related cases; ensuring that the Department of Public Safety does not cooperate with ICE; guaranteeing that all international students have the opportunity to complete their degree online if deported; and committing to join the Rutgers Faculty Bill, an official resolution proposed by the Rutgers University Senate to create a mutual academic defense compact among the universities that are part of the Big Ten academic alliance.

Regarding ICE cooperation, the executive director of public safety, Mike Yankowski, stated that the Department of Public Safety does not cooperate with federal agents unless there is a court order or a process involving crimes.
President Guskiewicz stated that any support for international students facing deportation would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that, so far, no student has been deported. He also acknowledged by answering the demands that there is currently no program in place to guarantee the completion of their studies in such situations and that no efforts have yet been made to develop one.
In addition, Trustee Brianna Scott explained that there are multiple factors, such as internship credits, in-person lab requirements, and housing location, that justify evaluating each deported student’s case individually.
At the end of the meeting, David Hogan, 20, a social relations and policy student and member of the Hurriya Coalition, stated that no agreement was actually reached and that the board was constantly making quick excuses for their demands.
At 6:30 p.m., two police officers were at the doors of the administrative building, and in front of them, in the lobby, were dozens of students and the general public chanting and haranguing anti-genocide chants while marching around the first floor.
From time to time, those inside the building would sit in circles, hold hands, and sing or give speeches.
Only 17 people stayed after the three warnings given by the police. They were singing, giving each other emotional support. One by one, they were handcuffed and taken to the east wing of the building while students outside protested against the arrests.
By the minute, more students were arriving at the protest, reaching more than 50 people outside the building, waiting for the transport of those arrested to the police station.

However, it wasn’t until nearly 10 p.m. that everyone was released through the south door of the building. They had been processed inside the building and charged with trespassing.
This is the second time pro-Palestinian student activists have been arrested and charged with trespassing in less than a year for a sit-in demonstration inside the MSU administrative building. In October, five student protestors were arrested for trespassing after also refusing to leave the Hannah Administration Building.
“They handcuffed us and processed us inside; they didn’t take us somewhere else, and we were charged with trespassing,” said Laura Sager, 72, who was arrested at the administration building.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Democrats are resurrecting a resolution that would allow voters to weigh in on whether the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Citizens United ruling should stand — an effort that comes just a week after historic spending in Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court election.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission found that corporations and unions have a First Amendment right to speech and laws preventing them from spending were unconstitutional. The decision has enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend virtually unlimited amounts of money on elections. 
Lawmakers said the decision is the core of why spending has gotten so out of hand in the last decade and a half. According to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, preliminary data shows that nearly $100 million was spent during the April race between Justice-elect Susan Crawford and Brad Schimel.
At a press conference, Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) called billionaire Elon Musk — who has directed efforts in the Trump administration to slash federal programs and fire federal employees and spent millions trying to influence the outcome of the Wisconsin  Supreme Court — a “carpetbagger.” He criticized Musk for giving money to voters, saying Wisconsinites shouldn’t get accustomed to being paid to vote, but should be voting to make their voices heard.
Smith said money in elections is making voters feel like billionaires are outweighing their voices. He then called specific attention to President Donald Trump telling investors to ‘buy’ on social media — as the stock market was wavering — just hours before he announced that for 90 days he would be lowering U.S. tariffs to 10% on most countries and raising them on China to 125%. The move caused the stock market to rise and, then led to accusations of market manipulation and insider trading. 
“The man in the White House sent this message — ‘A great time to buy! A great time to buy.’ He sent his message to his rich donors and friends,” Smith said. 
“It pays off to put millions of dollars in campaigns because they’re going to make money in the end if they win,” Smith continued. “We need Congress to reevaluate this role of corporations and billionaires and their role in money and politics.”
The advisory referendum would seek an answer from voters on whether Wisconsin’s Congressional delegation should support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision. Specifically it would ask voters the question whether “only human beings are endowed with constitutional rights — not corporations, unions, nonprofit organizations, or other artificial entities” and whether “money is not speech, and therefore limiting political contributions and spending is not equivalent to limiting political speech.”
Smith said voters sent a message that they won’t be bought last week by rejecting Musk’s preferred candidate.
“We don’t want that money coming in here in Wisconsin to buy our elections and our freedom,” Smith said. “Let’s put this referendum on the ballots, so voters can make their voices heard directly to Congress.
Wisconsin Democracy Campaign Operations and Policy Director Beverly Speer emphasized at the press conference that the issue goes beyond Musk, saying that spending by independent expenditures —  totaling about $51.5 million in April — are often backed by billionaires and operated in shady ways.
“Don’t be mistaken, Musk is just one of a handful of billionaires who contributed to this bipartisan arms race,” Speer said. “Things will continue to escalate… Unless we want to see a $150 million race, and then maybe a $200 million race, we need to cut off this free-for-all.”  
Speer said that voters are mostly opposed to the vast spending in campaigns. 
The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign conducted a survey in February that found about 88% of Wisconsin voters statewide are “extremely concerned” or “very concerned” about the influence of money in politics. The survey also found that 86% of respondents said people and groups shouldn’t be able to spend “unlimited amounts of money” to support political campaigns and 83% of respondents said there should be limits on how much campaigns can spend.
“While working Wisconsinites stretch to pay rent, feed their families, and make ends meet, billionaires treat our elections like a game — pouring millions into a state that they don’t even normally live in, hoping to tip the scales in favor of their special interests,” Speer said. 
A statewide referendum would need to pass the Republican-led Legislature, and Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) acknowledged that previous attempts have been unsuccessful. She said she welcomes more conversation about the issue and proposal.
“Not once has it even gotten a hearing, and you know, why? Because politicians who are beholden to big money in politics don’t want to hear what the people have to say about it, but we are calling on… our colleagues to join us in this resolution,” Subeck said. 
Subeck said lawmakers were starting with the referendum because any changes in state law are “neutered” by the Citizens United decision. She said Democrats would be introducing more bills to address the issue in the near future, including on disclosure of money in campaigns and on public financing. However, she said pushing Congress for a constitutional amendment will be key to changing the state of money in elections. 
“We cannot fundamentally make wholesale change in this through any state law as long as Citizens United is still law of the land,” Subeck said. “We need to amend our federal Constitution and we need to send that message clear and simple.”

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As part of the spring opening ritual, Yellowstone National Park officials will begin opening entrances and roads to the public on April 18, the National Park Service announced in a press release Thursday.
But until that time, the public can ride bicycles along a 49-mile section of Yellowstone National Park roads between the West Entrance at West Yellowstone, Montana, and the North Entrance at Gardiner, Montana. 
Bicycling through Yellowstone before the park opens for public vehicle travel is a unique way to experience Yellowstone without the crowds and experience the park’s gradual transition from winter to spring, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

Although Yellowstone is open all year, most of the entrances and roads close during the winter, when the park is covered in snow and only accessible by snowcoach tour, snowmobile, skis or snowshoes.
Normally, only the road between Yellowstone’s North Entrance at Gardiner, and the Northeast Entrance near Cooke City, Montana, are open all year to vehicles. 
But with the arrival of spring – weather permitting – Yellowstone crews will open the West Entrance located at West Yellowstone to the public on April 18. 
Beginning that day, the public will be able to use either the North Entrance or the West Entrance to drive to several of Yellowstone’s features and landmarks, including Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful, the Lamar Valley, Norris Geyser Basin and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, Yellowstone officials said.

‘Hardly anybody there’: How to bicycle through Yellowstone National Park without cars

In celebration of National Park Week, all Yellowstone entrance fees will be waived April 19, the National Park Service said. 
Additional roads and entrances will open as weather allows in May, park officials said.  
Many services in Yellowstone National Park are not yet available for the summer season. Park officials encouraged everyone planning to visit the park to first check the online park roads and current conditions listing. Visitors should be prepared for sudden snow and extremely cold weather and know that many trails and boardwalks are still covered in snow. 
Visitors who plan to bicycle through Yellowstone before the park opens should take additional cold weather precautions, ride single file on the right-hand side of the road, pack in and pack out all food and trash and be prepared to navigate in and out of the park on their own without access to any cell phone service or park amenities. 
Additional information about bicycling in Yellowstone is available online. 
Established in 1872, Yellowstone National Park is America’s first national park. Most of Yellowstone is located in Wyoming, with portions extending into Montana. A small, 50-square-mile slice of Yellowstone that is not accessible by car is situated in Idaho.

Longtime Montanans are all too familiar with the scene more than 40 years ago when state hunters and federal agents slaughtered thousands of bison as they left the Yellowstone National Park. The gory photos were published internationally as the last of the bison that once roamed the Great Plains were gunned down for simply walking across the invisible park boundary.  
Back then, the reasoning was a simple but scientifically-flawed fear that bison would transmit brucellosis to cattle, which can cause them to abort and threatened Montana’s “brucellosis free” status.  That’s supremely ironic since it was cattle that transmitted the disease to the bison in the first place — and there has never been a documented case of cattle being infected by bison in the wild.
In an attempt to find alternatives, state, federal, conservation and tribal interests came up with the Interagency Bison Management Plan to control the park’s bison population. The plan combined hunting as well as sending bison to be butchered and the meat distributed to tribes.  
Dead bison, however, don’t pass on their genes.  So it also contained a provision to hold bison in a quarantine facility to ensure they were brucellosis free, and then send them to tribal nations who highly value the genetic integrity of the park’s wild bison.
So far this year, about 700 bison have been “removed” through hunt, slaughter, and quarantine under the recently updated management plan and the park plans to “remove” about that many more to keep the herd between 3,000 and 6,000 animals.
The controversies surrounding the actions have intensified rather than cooled.  Some seek “roam free” status outside the park. Others support or criticize tribal hunting and question the treaty rights. And some claim the quarantine and transfer to tribes is the privatization of public wildlife that threatens genetic integrity through “domestication” of wild bison.
All those claims are far too complex for one column, but they’re not hard to find in great detail online.  Suffice it to say there are strengths and weaknesses to all those positions.
It’s pretty hard to argue that being in close contact with tourists, cars and snowmobiles fits the definition of “wild” — especially when they “mow” residential yards in West Yellowstone.  Equally hard to believe being released on tribal lands is any more “domestication” than being in close contact with the park’s millions of tourists.  
Likewise, “hunting” is a misnomer for these human-tolerant bison.  And the idea that herds of bison can simply “roam free” in the increasingly populated lands around the park ignores the inescapable conflicts and consequences such “freedom” would entail for humans and bison.
But if truly wild bison are the goal, the park should be sending excess bison to their ancestral lands in the 1.1 million acre CM Russell and UL Bend National Wildlife Refuges.  By doing so they preserve the genetic integrity, provide a true hunt, and the bison are much more likely to survive than “roaming free” near the park.  
Why this hasn’t happened is a dang good question.  Moving federal wildlife to a federal wildlife refuge so they can truly “roam free” seems like such an obvious solution for the park, the tribes, the state — and most importantly, for the bison.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/09AE134A-1DD8-B71B-0B7D95F50A0D1075Original-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 07:02:19.761786

Brent Taylor is aiding his predecessor in adjusting Tennessee's campaign finance laws. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Former state Sen. Brian Kelsey is gaining some help from his successor in a quest to use state campaign funds to pay his legal fees after being pardoned for breaking federal campaign laws.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County told the Lookout Thursday that he drafted an amendment for Kelsey but that the former Germantown lawmaker would have to get a bill sponsor to attach it because he didn’t want to carry it through the legislature.
Taylor, who replaced Kelsey, said he did it as a “courtesy to a former senator” so he could “sell it to other people.” The amendment would go on Senate bill 229, according to Taylor.
Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, is sponsoring that bill with Republican Rep. Tim Hicks of Washington County. SB229, a Registry of Election Finance bill, was recommended to the Senate finance committee way back in February, if anyone can remember. It uses part of the professional privilege tax paid by lobbyists to fund a Registry reporting system change.
Briggs said Kelsey called him twice about the matter, but he said he hadn’t thought about the bill in two months.

The Hicks bill is to go before the House finance subcommittee Monday. Hicks, who also has been contacted by Kelsey, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is co-sponsoring the bill to add a provision stemming from the Ethics Commission’s decision requiring the governor to reimburse a group that paid for his travel to speak at a Florida event. He encourages lawmakers to take out liability insurance because of the potential for lawsuits after Republican Michelle Foreman sued him three years ago.
Hemmer said he could understand being allowed to use campaign funds for legal fees related to the legislature but not for federal criminal charges.
Briggs has another campaign finance bill he’s carrying with Republican Rep. Tim Rudd of Murfreesboro that’s to be heard by the Government Operations Committee Monday after the House suspended the rules Thursday to consider it. Rudd said Thursday via text he plans no amendment. 
Taylor said the amendment adds language saying people who’ve been acquitted, had charges dropped or been pardoned could pay legal fees with state campaign funds.
The Registry of Election Finance told Kelsey he couldn’t use his state account to pay attorneys in the federal case. He had $197,519 in his state account before transferring it to his Red State Political Action Committee in June 2023. The PAC has more than $180,300, according to the latest filing with the state.
Kelsey hired at least six lawyers after being indicted for violating federal campaign finance law by funneling more than $80,000 through two political action committees to the American Conservative Union, which paid for ads in his failed 2016 congressional race. It is illegal to use state campaign money to pay for a federal campaign because the funds are raised under different rules.
Kelsey pleaded guilty in 2022, then embarked on a three-year tour to get out of it. He was turned down by the courts at every level, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
Ex-Sen. Brian Kelsey pleads guilty to two counts of federal campaign finance violations

Lawmakers such as House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison defended Kelsey recently, saying Congress disallowed state funds for federal campaigns to eliminate competition.
Thanks to President Donald Trump, he served only two weeks of a 21-month sentence, likely after someone called in a favor.
Now, he’s asking for another favor. 
Said Taylor, though, “In the abstract, if you take Kelsey out of it, and you’re just looking at it objectively, I don’t know that there’s an issue. But what complicates this for me … you’ve got a person that fits the description that you’re looking to amend the law to benefit, and the optics of it are not good when you can see a direct beneficiary.”
What numbers?
Sen. Bo Watson defended his bill to restrict immigrant education Thursday by throwing out the cost of $35 million to teach students whose second language is English. 
Yet while he claimed to be defending fiscal responsibility in Tennessee, he provided no revenue figures from those darned, inescapable sales taxes and property taxes, both of which immigrant residents pay, regardless of legal documentation. As chairman of the Senate finance committee, Watson is typically measured in his approach, and in this vein he continued to paint the question as one designed to deal with financial burden, not social import.
Yet the Hixson/Chattanooga Republican (inadvertently?) omitted the critical part of the financial equation, leaving some to question his credibility.
Watson, who has been challenged by ministers and Chattanooga businesses, also failed to point out that the Hamilton County Principals Association “strongly opposes” passage of Senate Bill 836, which escaped the full Senate on a 19-13 vote with the rarity of six Republicans opposing. 
Hamilton County principals oppose bill to require immigration status checks on schoolchildren

“As leaders of public schools across Hamilton County, we stand firmly in the belief that every child and every community must be served,” says a release from the group headed by Greg Wilkey, principal of East Side Elementary School.
The letter goes on to say that efforts to exclude children from school based on their immigration status undermine principals’ mission of “creating safe, welcoming, and inclusive environments where all students can thrive.” (Here’s a tip for the uninitiated: Don’t use the word “inclusive.” President Donald Trump and his minions hate it.)
Not that these folks don’t count, but they might as well have been talking to the wind, even if Republican Sen. Todd Gardenhire of Chattanooga disagreed with his buddy and voted against the bill.
The Senate’s Democrats balked at the bill, as expected, citing Bible verses to make the point that the “least of those” among us deserve respect.
But lawmakers who would have us believe everything they do comes straight from God showed their true colors throughout the week, including Republican Rep. Monty Fritts of Kingston who said there is “no greater act of rebellion in these United States than illegally coming across that border.”
Wrong again, Mr. Chemtrail. 



				Rep. Monty Fritts, a Kingston Republican, said there is “no greater act of rebellion in these United States than illegally coming across that border,” but storming the U.S. Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of power is right up there.			


Sitting around smoking meth all day and living off the government is worse than getting up every morning and doing jobs that are hard as hell. Fritts sponsored the infamous “chemtrail” bill that prohibits the release of chemicals into the air, largely believed to target those streaks across the sky made by jet planes. (Incidentally, a separate “kill my chemtrail” bill failed in a Senate committee a couple of weeks ago. Evidently, they couldn’t figure out whom to charge with a crime.)
It must also be noted that “rebellion” includes acts such as storming the U.S. Capitol to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power, not sneaking into the country to climb around on roofs or cook so you don’t have to. Of course, you can earn a pardon for insurrection if the president likes you.
Where this winds up is hard to tell.
Watson’s bill differs from the House version in that it requires school districts to check students’ immigration status before possibly charging tuition. The House bill, which hasn’t gone to the floor for a final vote, gives school districts the option to check students’ documents.
If the two measures don’t match, they could wind up going through (conference committee) negotiations and then pass or fail on a final vote. Failure would mean the state can’t challenge the 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, which would be a great disappointment to Watson and Co.
Synthetic hemp finds favor
Once bound for House and Senate talks, a much ballyhooed hemp bill ran into an amendment Thursday expected to make versions from each chamber match.
The House gathered more than 50 votes to prohibit products with the hemp-derivative THCA from being sold in Tennessee stores, even though it meets guidelines lawmakers passed.
Hemp industry fears slate of restrictive bills could gut industry

The Senate bill also contains the THCA ban, likely enabling the two measures to avoid negotiations as the 2025 session hurtles toward an end in less than two weeks.
Republican Reps. Kevin Vaughan of Collierville and Ryan Williams argued in favor of leaving the THCA alone, along with Faison, who said removing it would affect only natural hemp products.
Vaughan acknowledged the hemp market has been the “wild west” but said Wyatt Earp and his buddies will be riding herd  on it soon enough when the Alcoholic Beverage Commission starts policing an industry being pulled from convenience and grocery stores and turned over to liquor and vape shops.
House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland and Republican lawmakers such as Rep. Sabi Kumar of Springfield supported the amendment to ban THCA, saying once people light the stuff it turns into marijuana.
House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons of Nashville chastised the chamber for backing a move to penalize hemp farmers and killing the “flour” part of hemp that goes into products, leaving only those tasty synthetics.
Back from the ashes
An Innocence Project bill that died in the Senate Judiciary Committee in mid-March, then re-emerged after an amendment, cleared the full Senate Thursday, akin to an inmate who turns up exonerating evidence.
In fact, the bill creates a process for district attorneys general to petition judges to take a new look at post-conviction relief cases. The District Attorneys Conference opposed the bill initially.
But the bill’s sponsor, Gardenhire, wrangled it out of the depths of his own committee and pushed it to passage with only a handful of Republicans opposing it on the floor. By God, we wouldn’t want to set up a method for innocent people to be freed.
  Sen. Todd Gardenhire, a Chattanooga Republican, resuscitated and wrangled a measure to enable those convicted of crimes to re-litigate their case if evidence turns up showing someone else committed the crime.
The bill’s House sponsor, Democratic state Rep. Bob Freeman of Nashville, did considerably better, winning passage 85-7 last week.
“It just creates a better, more efficient process to litigate innocence cases,” said Jason Gishner, with the Innocence Project. He added that people on both sides of the argument admitted the law has a “hole” that needs to be closed.
The measure would enable people who entered guilty pleas before conviction to go back into court if non-scientific evidence surfaces showing someone else committed the crime. 
A man who’d been in prison for more than three decades testified before the committee about the difficulty of getting out in spite of being innocent.
Gishner said it shouldn’t take 31 years of prison time to make your case.
“No more Mr. Nice Guy”
Gov. Bill Lee issued a letter — not a veto — to lawmakers a week ago notifying them he was letting a bill dealing with emergency powers take effect without his signature.  
House Bill 324 by Republican Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern and Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon allows the governor to maintain authority during emergencies as long as it doesn’t usurp the legislature’s power.
“This decision reflects my deep concern about bills that adversely impact the state’s ability to protect the 7 million Tennesseans we serve,” Lee said in a letter to Lt. Gov. Randy McNally. 
The governor added that returning the bill minus his signature was designed to “caution strongly against legislation” that could affect the state’s response during disasters such as Hurricane Helene. The Tennessee Journal reported on the letter initially.
Lee hasn’t vetoed a bill since taking office more than six years ago. The only veto in recent memory came from former Gov. Bill Haslam, who nixed the bill making the Bible the official book of Tennessee. The legislature failed to override, even though it takes only a constitutional majority to do so.
Pody said this week he might write the same type of letter if he were in Lee’s shoes but added that each branch of government should “zealously protect” its power.
“I’m in the legislative branch, so I want to make sure that our legislative authority is protected and nobody takes it away and nobody oversteps what they’re supposed to do,” Pody said.
The bill’s impetus came from the COVID pandemic and events in other states dealing with vaccinations and mandates for churches to close. Lee didn’t put those on Tennesseans, and Pody and Grills said they want to make sure no future governors can.
Grills declined to criticize the governor’s stance on the matter and said they had talked about the bill. 
“I just believe we have constitutional rights that were given to us because we were born in America and specifically in Tennessee, and I don’t believe the governor, in a state of emergency, should ever have any ability to circumvent those rights just by the stroke of a pen,” Grills said.
No dice
For the trial that everyone is wishing would start on time April 22 and end quickly, U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson ruled against former House Speaker Glenn Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren and decided prosecutors don’t have to identify confidential informants who wore wires.
Speculation is that several people gathered information for federal attorneys. And in a March court filing, Cothren implied that House Speaker Cameron Sexton, or someone in his office, wore a wire.
Court filing: Sexton likely wore a wire for federal investigators

Sexton, who is cooperating with the prosecution, was among 20 lawmakers who received subpoenas early this year from defense lawyers.
The case centers on kickbacks Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith allegedly received from Cothren after he created a secret political consulting business called Phoenix Solutions to get paid once Casada stepped down as speaker. Smith resigned from the legislature, took a guilty plea and is cooperating with prosecutors.
Hallway talk at Cordell Hull is that dozens of people received subpoenas, and lawmakers want to adjourn and leave Nashville so they won’t be called to testify while still in session and have to face those mean-spirited folks in the media.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idahoans can breathe a sigh of relief now that the Legislature has folded its tent and gone home. 
The bright side of this year’s session is that it could have been worse. The session lasted two weeks longer than expected, costing taxpayers about $20,000-$30,000 per day. 
The main reason for the delay was the inability of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee (JFAC) to finalize budgets for state programs. JFAC set many budgets even before it knew how much revenue would be available, and it then squandered time figuring out how to operate without defined procedural rules.
Without a guiding script, Idaho Legislature’s budget committee strays from voting procedures

Adding to the delay was JFAC’s decision to ignore the constitutional order of setting budgets. Since statehood, general legislation, which establishes state laws, was the job of the entire Legislature. Committees hold hearings, take testimony and produce bills for debate in both houses before sending them to the governor. 
JFAC’s job has been confined to providing the funding to finance the programs established through that policy-making process. However, in recent years JFAC has had the nerve to set itself up as a mini-legislature within the official Legislature. That is, to fund legislative policies with appropriation bills but also to set its own policies with “intent language” in the bills.
JFAC co-chair, Rep. Wendy Horman, justified the committee’s use of policy-making intent language, claiming it is the committee’s job to set “conditions, limitations and restrictions” on spending. She said, “it is the job of JFAC to set fiscal policy.” 
The Idaho Constitution would disagree. Appropriation bills are to fund the government, not to set state policy. 
Several JFAC members have raised legitimate concerns. Sen. Julie VanOrden said the use of intent language to set policy skirts the public vetting process and is “a real abuse of power.” Sen. Janie Ward-Engelking correctly observed that JFAC is “a budgeting committee, it’s not a policy committee.”
JFAC’s constitutionally improper policy-making has created memorable problems in the past. 
In the 2022 session, JFAC put intent language in House Bill 764, saying that federal money designed to make up for pandemic-related learning loss was to serve “school-aged participants ages 5 through 13 years.” When about 80 legitimate schools and child care centers received grants, the extreme-right outrage machine swung into action, claiming fraud and abuse because some kids under 5 might have benefited from the federal money, which federal guidelines allowed. That resulted in a flurry of pointless legal actions and investigations, which ended up costing the state way more than the miniscule amount that may have been incidentally spent on kids under 5.
In 2024, JFAC put intent language in House Bill 770, the funding bill for the Department of Transportation, that killed a favorable sale of the bedraggled transportation department building on State Street in Boise. The restriction resulted in litigation and will end up costing the state millions trying to renovate an outdated building that will be an unusable money pit. 
This year, JFAC has picked up the pace of its unlawful policy-making. In House Bill 459, the Department of Labor appropriation bill, the mini-legislature required the preparation of several reports, including one requiring “an analysis of the impact of illegal immigration on the state’s labor market and the potential costs and benefits of using E-Verify.” 
This should be done through legislative action, not in the funding process.
Senate Bill 1209 calls for several legislative items. Among other things, Section 4 requires Idaho State University to lead any negotiations toward acquisition of the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine. Section 6 requires the State Board of Education to develop a new outcomes-based funding model for Idaho’s colleges and universities. Section 7 requires audits of state institutions of higher learning for compliance with Idaho’s ill-defined diversity, equity and inclusion laws. In essence, the DEI laws prohibit many of the virtues that Jesus taught in the New Testament.
Senate Bill 1196, requires the Idaho Commission for Libraries to report on compliance by state and school libraries with Idaho book ban laws. There are a number of other similar policy-making bills the JFAC mini-legislature churned out this session, but the list is too lengthy to lay out here.
It is high time for JFAC leadership to establish procedural rules to expedite the funding of programs enacted through the established legislative process. More important, however, is that the committee get back into its proper lane of setting budgets, rather than establishing state policy. 
If not, it may be necessary for those affected by its improper policy-making to institute court proceedings to get JFAC to comply with its limited duty of funding programs enacted by the official Legislature.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia House on Thursday approved another version of the state budget for fiscal year 2026, this one representing a “compromise” between the state Senate’s version — which largely reflected Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s proposals — and a very different one previously proposed by the House.
The new proposed state budget totals about $5.317 billion in base revenue spending, a $5 million decrease from the budget proposed by Morrisey at the beginning of the session. If the House’s passage of House Bill 2026 is accepted by the Senate, the proposed budget will become law.
With four members absent and not voting, the House approved HB 2026 78-18, with 10 Republicans joining eight of the chamber’s nine Democrats in voting against it. Del. John Williams, D-Monongalia, was the only Democrat to vote in support of the budget.
The current proposed budget includes about $210 million in supplemental funding, which will be appropriated to listed line items if this fiscal year ends with enough revenue to spend. Those line items, in order of priority, include: $125 million to the Division of Highways, $75 million to the Economic Development Project Fund, $10 million to the Water Development Authority and $250,000 to the Cabell County Commission for Lily’s Place, a nonprofit focused on supporting babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome.
The proposal also transfers about $33.6 million from general revenue to the state Personal Income Tax Reserve Fund. That money, said House Finance Chair Vernon Criss, R-Wood, can be allocated by the Legislature at any time.
“We have total access to those dollars at any time as a reserve fund,” Criss said. “… We’re just parking that money there so that at some time [in the future, when] we’ll have to start doing supplemental [appropriations] to keep the government going, that’s one of the places we can draw money down.”
The Personal Income Tax Reserve Fund currently has about $460 million. Of that, only $60 million is statutorily required to stay in the fund.
  Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, expressed frustration at transferring money to the Personal Income Tax Reserve Fund given its current funding levels in the face of other programming needs.
In the proposed budget, child care is only receiving about $8 million — which Criss said reflected Morrisey’s proposed funding level. Years ago, Young said, that line item was funded at $17 million and the need has not decreased.
“We’re adding … $33 million to a fund that has $460 million in it already, and we can’t fund child care at  the same amount that we did 10 years ago?” Young said. “I don’t get it.”
The most recent version of the budget also includes returning $15 million in funding to West Virginia University that the House previously cut. It also reflects fewer cuts to state agencies with consistent job vacancies. Initially, the House proposed a 2% cut to vacant positions that was expected to yield about $8 million in savings. But Criss said those cuts were difficult because of how some positions were categorized in the state budget. This budget includes a roughly 1% cut in force — only to already vacant positions — totaling about $6 million in savings.
Some changes in this version of the budget compared to funding levels from 2025 include an increase to the employer-paid share of the Public Employee Insurance Agency, a $100 million increase to foster care and adoption line items, a funding increase for the state Division of Corrections and a cut to Jobs & Hope.
Jobs & Hope is a program started by Gov. Jim Justice to help train and support people in recovery who are transitioning into the workforce. Criss said the cuts to the program reflected a proposal from Morrisey’s initial budget, which had the specific line item for the program collapsed into a larger line item.
“When the governor presented his budget, he collapsed a lot of those lines, and then he had to open up those line items again because he wanted the ability to move money around, and it’s not his job to do that,” Criss said. “It is our job to determine how those line items are spent.”
Last year, Criss said, the Jobs & Hope program — originally dubbed “Jim’s Dream” by Justice — was funded at $6.2 million. Now, it’s down to about $3.5 million.
“So we believe that’s where he made his cuts, and we took the Senate’s position [in the compromise],” Criss said.
Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, said it was disappointing to see a lack of funding for what he believes is a successful program for people in recovery, no matter his dislike for both the current and former governors.
“A good idea is a good idea. This is something that worked and I hate to see it cut in half like this,” Pushkin said. “It’s not a whole lot of money in regards to the entire budget. I hate to see it go away like this because of an administration change and it was somebody else’s idea … when something works, you should keep doing it no matter who’s dream it was.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)GEISMAR — Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple said Gov. Jeff Landry has refused to speak to him about the state’s insurance crisis in nearly a year, a claim the governor’s office disputes.
The open squabble between two Republican state leaders just days before legislators meet to tackle soaring coverage premiums, among other pressing issues, casts some doubt over whether the parties involved can arrive at solutions to make insurance more affordable.     
Temple’s remarks came near the end of a news conference Thursday morning in a gravel yard at Bengal Transportation, with large commercial trucks as a backdrop, where he announced his legislative agenda to tackle high auto and property insurance rates in Louisiana. The owners of a commercial trucking company and a towing business spoke in favor of Temple’s plans.
Landry held a similar conference the day before at the State Capitol, though his legislative agenda is focused primarily on auto insurance for the upcoming lawmaking session that starts Monday. 
Temple, who did not attend the governor’s event, said he last spoke to Landry in May 2024 regarding the insurance legislation lawmakers passed last year. After the governor vetoed some of that legislation, Temple said he called the governor’s office and was told Landry wasn’t available “at any time for the foreseeable future,” Temple said.  
The governor disputed that account. 
“I’ve never refused to meet with the insurance commissioner,” Landry said through his spokeswoman, Kate Kelly. “I’ve always asked the insurance commissioner to bring me the data for lowering insurance premiums in this state.” 
The governor said Temple has never been able to produce a package of bills with a guaranteed percentage of premium discounts for policyholders. If the commissioner can provide one, “I’m all ears,” Landry said.
Gov. Landry previews proposals he says will bring down auto insurance rates

Landry and Temple differ in some of their views as to what has caused auto premiums to skyrocket in Louisiana. In many respects, their differences are a continuation of the decades-old debate between trial lawyers and the insurance companies they sue. 
Plaintiffs lawyers argue insurance companies are greedy, while insurers argue Louisiana laws have made it too easy to file bodily injury lawsuits for high-dollar settlements that aren’t always warranted.
The governor said his legislative agenda takes a “balanced approach” that targets both trial lawyers and insurance companies to try to lower rates. The commissioner’s agenda also targets both sides but focuses mostly on his take on litigation reform with the backing of insurance companies. 
The Temple agenda includes, among others, bills to cap damage awards a plaintiff can receive in an injury lawsuit and to limit the fees lawyers can receive for certain kinds of cases. Another would prohibit insurers from factoring advertising costs into their policy rates, which is also a proposal the governor backs. 
Many of the proposals are ones lawmakers considered but never passed in previous years. They include a bill to require claimants provide sworn proof of loss statements, and legislation that would limit the amount a plaintiff can recover for medical expenses to the actual amount the plaintiff paid to their medical provider.
During Thursday’s press conference, Temple said Landry made some “incorrect” statements about two of the proposals the governor unveiled the day before. 
One, according to Landry, would demand transparency from insurers regarding proprietary formulas insurance companies to calculate policy rates. Insurers are allowed to treat their rate formulas as trade secrets, which prevents consumers and lawmakers from knowing how the rates are calculated. 
However, Temple said insurers already provide him with any information he asks for, including confidential materials, though he acknowledged that he cannot share those details outside of his office. 
Another Landry agenda item Temple questioned is a proposal that would give the insurance commissioner authority to prohibit any rates deemed “excessive,” which Landry said is a power afforded to Temple’s peers in many other states. 
Temple leans on data to explain high La. auto insurance rates, but plaintiffs’ lawyers don’t buy it

Temple said such a proposal is unnecessary.
“I have all the authority I need to deny a rate that is too high,” he said.
Louisiana law currently prohibits the insurance commissioner from rejecting a rate as “excessive” unless the market is declared “noncompetitive.” The law states that all insurance markets are presumed to be competitive unless the commissioner declares a market “noncompetitive” after holding a public hearing in which someone has proven that competition does not exist in the state for a particular line of insurance.
Some of ideas Temple is backing to address the homeowner insurance crisis include a bill to establish tax credits for installing fortified roofs and a measure that increases the notice insurers have to provide before cancelling or not renewing a policy from 30 days to 45 days. It also requires the insurer to include a reason for ending coverage.  
Both press conferences this week have recentered insurance rates as a top priority for lawmakers this session.
“We just need to get something done,” Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, said in a phone interview. “It’s the one common thing I hear from everybody — Republican, Democrat, independent — it doesn’t matter.”
Johnson said the House Insurance Committee, on which he sites, will meet Tuesday to consider some of the measures.
“We spent six months having hearings,” he said. “I think we’re more informed than we were a year ago, and I think the governor is more receptive to some of these bills.”

(Brandon Bell | Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”
Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
Public debate
Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.










It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician


From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
Making the connection
Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

Tennessee public schools could soon be required to teach the “success sequence” — that the keys to future success are to graduate high school; enter the workforce or pursue postsecondary education; marry, and then have children. The state joins others around the country introducing legislation around the controversial education idea.
The state House approved the bill, 73-20, on Monday, sending the legislation to Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s desk for his signature. The Tennessee Senate previously passed the bill in a 25-5 vote.
Educators would be required to teach the success sequence as part of family life education beginning in the 2026-27 school year.
Utah’s governor recently signed similar legislation into law. Several states, including Mississippi, Kentucky, Texas, and Ohio, have introduced bills related to the success sequence this year.
The success sequence was popularized in the early 2000s by researchers who argued this life path yields better economic prospects in adulthood. Critics have argued that it places a burden on individuals rather than structures that drive poverty, like access to quality education, housing, and infrastructure.
Research from conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute in 2021 found that 76% of U.S. parents support teaching the sequence.
A 2020 report contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration broadly found an association between these individual milestones — education, full-time employment, and marriage before children — and lower poverty rates. However, the report found more research is needed as to whether the sequence causes this success. The report also found relatively few studies that examined the sequence as a whole.
  “It’s demonstrated that the nuclear family is the best antidote that we have in society to avoiding poverty,” said Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
More recently, the success sequence has become a touchstone in conservative-leaning education policy circles, promoted by charter school founder Ian Rowe, a senior fellow at AEI. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon’s first official K-12 school visit was to Rowe’s charter school in New York City in March.
Much of the bill’s language matches model legislation from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that published Project 2025, a policy plan built to reshape the U.S. government.
Republican Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood sponsored the bill.
“It’s demonstrated that the nuclear family is the best antidote that we have in society to avoiding poverty,” Bulso said during earlier debate on the bill.
Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn of Nashville attempted to add language to also teach economic barriers that can prevent students from completing the sequence, but the amendment failed to be considered.
“What you are trying to do refuses to acknowledge the diversity and plurality of the human experience,” she said. “(This bill) ignores the real barriers that people face, including me, a millennial woman.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)An association of roughly 1,300 resident physicians and fellows at the University of Colorado School of Medicine is escalating unionization efforts that it says have stalled in the face of opposition from school administrators and CU system leadership.
Supporters and members of the Housestaff Association of the University of Colorado Hospitals, which represents medical trainees, rallied outside CU’s Anschutz Medical Campus on Wednesday, urging leaders to voluntarily recognize the union’s right to collectively bargain on behalf of its members.
Over 900 of HSA’s 1,300 members have signed a petition in support of collective bargaining and full unionization, which was delivered to a meeting of the CU Board of Regents on Wednesday. It’s the latest step the organization has taken after nearly a year of talks with school administrators that have proven “unproductive, uncooperative and unsuccessful,” outgoing HSA co-president Nik Kaufman said at Wednesday’s rally.

“We have meetings with administrators from all levels of the university, including some of the regents,” said Kaufman, who recently finished his fourth year of residency at Anschutz and began a fellowship in hospice and palliative medicine. “But we have yet to see movement or clarity, because CU has refused to bargain in good faith.”
Current and incoming HSA leaders say collective bargaining would establish a safe and transparent way for medical trainees to advocate for improved pay and working conditions, including standardized hours and rest periods between shifts.
“We got into this line of work because we want to help people,” said incoming co-president Simone Raiter, a third-year resident in interventional radiology who spoke at the rally a few hours after coming off a long night shift. “Every Coloradan deserves high-quality care, offered by doctors who are mentally and physically prepared and able to provide it.”
HSA, founded in 1969, describes itself as having operated as a “union-lite” group for most of its history, meeting informally with administrators to discuss trainees’ compensation and well-being. In recent years, its members have begun to advocate for a more formal collective bargaining contract, joining a wave of dozens of similar union drives among residents at medical schools across the country.










We got into this line of work because we want to help people ... Every Coloradan deserves high-quality care, offered by doctors who are mentally and physically prepared and able to provide it.


– Simone Raiter, third-year resident in interventional radiology who is incoming co-president of the CU Housestaff Association


A law passed by the Colorado Legislature in 2023 expanded protections for public-sector union activity, but stopped short of guaranteeing full collective bargaining rights for all public employees.
In a statement, Mark Couch, the CU School of Medicine’s chief of staff and associate dean of public relations, said the existing relationship between the school and HSA has “yielded considerable positive results for residents and fellows,” including stipend increases, moving bonuses and other benefits.
“Leaders of the Graduate Medical Education office are disappointed in how the HSA leaders who organized (Wednesday’s) event are portraying our shared commitment to their success,” Couch said. “We are committed to continuing our work with all 1,300 residents and fellows to prepare them to become outstanding physicians who offer compassionate care to our patients.”
But a collective bargaining contract would provide certainty for residents, said Gaiter, who became more involved with HSA after what she called “b.s.” during negotiations over salary and benefits increases.
“We were initially promised what would have been a 20% increase, and they reneged on that,” Gaiter said. “And I learned more over time that this is not a new thing. This has been happening for the past 40-plus years.”
With the School of Medicine refusing to voluntarily recognize HSA’s collective bargaining rights, members are urging CU regents — a nine-member governing board elected by Colorado voters — to direct recognition instead.
“To have gotten over 70% of our members (to sign the petition), I think it shows that the regents should not ignore us,” Kaufman said. “They should do the right thing.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s Legacy Fund lost about $1 billion in value last week as the stock market plunged, but the investments are managed to weather volatility, according to testimony from a legislative hearing this week.
Jodi Smith, interim executive director of the Retirement and Investment Office, commented on the impact of the stock market fluctuations Wednesday during a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Government Operations Division.
“The market will ebb and flow and it will go up and down, and really what determines the market is how we react to it,” Smith told lawmakers. “Our goal is to not be very reactionary.”

The Legacy Fund, created by voters to invest state oil and gas revenue, was valued at $12 billion as of Jan. 31. A more recent value is not yet available from the Retirement and Investment Office, which administers the investments.
Smith said after she made her comments to the committee, the market had gone up again. The stock market has been volatile since President Donald Trump last week announced tariffs on international imports.
“We anticipate a recovery of our losses when the market normalizes,” she said Thursday.
Scott Anderson, chief investment officer, said the Legacy Fund is diversified in order to withstand market fluctuations. The long-term nature and large scale of the investments also give the state advantages to balance risk, he said.
“We recognize, though, that there’ll be short-term fluctuations,” Anderson said.
North Dakota lawmakers spend earnings from the Legacy Fund to pay for tax relief and state projects. To “smooth out” fluctuations with the markets, the amount available for lawmakers to spend is based on a five-year average of the Legacy Fund’s value, Anderson said. Earnings are defined as 7% of that five-year average. 
Lawmakers have $601 million in earnings available to spend for the 2025-27 budget cycle, a figure that was already established and won’t be affected by the market.
The principal of the Legacy Fund can only be tapped with two-thirds approval from the Legislature. So far, lawmakers have not spent any of the principal.
The Retirement and Investment Office also recently hired additional internal investment managers, reducing how much the state will spend on fees to external investment managers. Growing the internal investment program also allows the state to rebalance portfolios more quickly and precisely, Anderson said.

Patrick Morrisey on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025 said that state jails and prisons were detaining 58 people suspected of immigration violations. (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement photo)In January, I received a text that terrified me to my core and opened my eyes to an inhumane, broken system: “ICE just came and got Mohammed.”
The man that federal agents yanked out of his South Charleston workplace and stuffed into a van without explanation is a lot like any other West Virginian I’ve ever known. My friend learned English through his love of country music. When he’d play guitar for me, he’d sing the song “Where I Come From,” and if it weren’t for him changing the line about cornbread and chicken to hummus and pita, you’d swear it was Alan Jackson singing.
Mohammed entered this country legally. He met his ex on a trip to France, they got engaged and he moved to Kentucky to be with her. They later divorced, and as he’d learn while being transferred from federal holding facility to federal holding facility (four in four months), he failed to renew his green card on time — something that he was never made aware of.
For eight years, Mohammed was often the one to open and close the restaurant where he worked. He worked long hours, helped his friends when they were in need, and he’d even feed unsheltered people when he’d see them around.
He loved his home away from home. And in turn, our country is now treating him like he’s not even human.
Mohammed and other inmates were loaded onto a bus and transported from South Central Regional Jail to Moshannon, Pennsylvania. The trip overlapped with a meal time, so staff handed out sandwiches, but the men couldn’t reach their mouths because of the restraints. Unable to use their hands, they were forced to eat by bending forward and doing their best to eat the food.
“Everyone looked like wild animals trying to eat,” he later told me. A man that spent eight years pouring his love of food into the people of this place was forced to choose between going hungry and eating his food like a dog.
At work, Mohammed would make sure the kitchen was spotless, a far cry from the conditions of the facilities he has been held in. Usually, Mohammed is crammed in a room with about 100 other people; everyone sick from having irregular access to showers and bathrooms. At one point, Mohammed became constipated. He went 20 days begging staff for help and nearly died before seeing a health care provider.
When people hear about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “targeting criminals,” what they don’t tell you is that they’re disappearing people like Mohammed; a man with no criminal record. He’s a religious man who’s never done drugs, doesn’t own weapons and doesn’t even drive a car. All he’s done is work, pay taxes and contribute to society.
His only “crime” was failing to proactively check and see if his green card was renewed. The best our country could offer this hardworking, productive member of society was a notice sent to an address where he no longer lived.
Until his residency status became part of a political movement, the federal government made no attempt to locate him despite the fact that they clearly knew where he worked as evidenced by snatching him up while he was working at his job.
With mass deportations in effect, his support network on the outside hasn’t been able to figure out anything about his case. When we filed a Freedom of Information Act request for his ICE record in February, I was notified that the request was number 28,000 in line. As of writing this today, the request is number 10,180.
Mohammed’s story isn’t unique, but it’s largely invisible. No matter your politics, people who have committed no crimes shouldn’t be chained for days, denied medical care, forced to eat food like an animal and wait months for information about their case.
While politicians debate immigration at the border, there are tens of thousands of people who have lived and worked among us for years getting swept up in these raids — torn from their communities and forgotten in detention centers across the country.
I want Americans to know what’s happening in their name, and I want them to remember the name Mohammed.

Cory Booker.” Say it again, as a mantra, and once more for good measure. Say it with hope. Say it like you mean it, if for no other reason than for it to not only energize you but others, as if creating a ripple effect. Say it with respect for the courage and fortitude that was fueled by anger from a Democratic leader who not only showed his level of intellect but of one who speaks loud and clear for so many of us (and it should be each and every one of us) whose voices are raised in unison, saying, “Enough!”
After reading numerous news reports of Booker’s marathon Senate speech from various news sources that I depend on as a writer of commentaries and as an American (I highly suggest that you turn to news sources that have not only stood the test of time but who consistently deliver solid reporting that has been checked and checked again), it’s important to note that Booker’s 25-hour and 5-minute speech broke the record set by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond who held a time of 24 hours and 18 minutes for his filibuster against the 1957 Civil Rights Act. That timeframe represents a period of 68 years. And even if you know very little about that earlier time period, the mere fact that Booker broke that record is as significant (and perhaps even more significant) as the points he raised in his speech, finally extinguishing the limelight that had previously belonged to Thurmond. And if you can’t connect the dots, then we’ve lost more than we think we’ve lost. 
It’s a crucial time in American history; listen and listen with intent. “As powerful as Thurmond was,” Booker said, “the people were more powerful.” It’s yet one more declarative sentence that repeated becomes so very deeply ingrained in each of us.
In a Tuesday night post on X, Booker said, “This is a moment where we cannot afford to be silent, when we must speak up.” He went on to call it a “moral moment,” as his fiery speech resonated throughout the Senate chambers and he called to task, to accountability, to responsibility, all that the Trump administration has dismantled or intends to dismantle.
There’s a great scene from the movie “The Untouchables,” where Sean Connery’s character, Malone, poses this question to Eliot Ness, played by Keven Costner, “What are you prepared to do?” With one voice, let’s do what the late Georgia Congressman John Lewis urged people to do when insisting on justice, “Get in good trouble.”

We have been there for you and with you, connecting you to your neighbors, promoting your unique history, inspiring the next generation, championing what makes your town or city special. 
But right now, we can’t. And we are angry about it. You should be too.
In 2022, we assisted libraries, historical societies, artisan centers, radio stations, community centers and cultural institutions in navigating a disaster like what we are experiencing right now, an historic flood. We requested and received emergency grant funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and poured every dime back into places that were devastated by flood waters because it is our mission to help Kentucky communities thrive. 
We wanted then, and want now, to be part of the rebuilding of Kentucky’s communities ravaged by flooding, but we can’t. Why?

Event organizers placed fake tombstones to represent a funeral for bigotry and oppressive systems. (Morgan Watkins/LPM News)Two new state laws targeting transgender Kentuckians are taking effect this year, building on a pattern the Kentucky legislature has established over the past few years of proposing and sometimes enacting laws that target LGBTQ+ Kentuckians.
The Republican supermajority’s actions are part of a nationwide trend of conservative politicians promoting anti-trans messaging and approving policies that restrict trans people’s access to gender-affirming health care and limit their ability to participate in public life.
“I know what it means to be denied public accommodations, to have doors shut in my face simply for existing as my true self,” Carma Bell Marshall, a Black trans woman from Louisville, said last week at a local event held on the internationally recognized Trans Day of Visibility. “Our worth is not defined by policies that try to erase us.”
The GOP’s anti-trans push was supercharged by President Donald Trump’s return in January. One of his first executive orders aimed to delegitimize trans people by stripping the concept of gender identity from federal policy and requiring all people to use their assigned sex at birth on government identification like U.S. passports.
LGBTQ+ people, allies, advocacy groups and researchers on extremism have expressed concerns that the increase in anti-trans rhetoric, particularly in right-wing circles, is likely a contributing factor to increased harassment and violence toward trans and other gender-nonconforming individuals.
  Rep. Bill Wesley, R-Ravenna, has said he intends to propose more anti-trans bathroom restrictions next year and indicated he would support arresting trans women who use women’s bathrooms. (LRC Public Information)
Some Republican politicians aren’t disavowing the idea of such violence. Kentucky Rep. Bill Wesley of Ravenna — who made headlines for confronting Marshall last month outside a public bathroom — indicated, in an interview with the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, that he understands why someone might resort to violence against a trans woman who uses a women’s restroom.
“I don’t know of anyone being violent with any trans person here. I’ve never been with anybody that has been violent. But I could see why somebody would be violent towards somebody that claims to be a woman and they’re actually a man,” Wesley told KyCIR this week, using language that disregards trans people’s identities. “Well, you’re invading their wife’s privacy.”
Speaking on his decision to confront Marshall, he said: “People (are) sick of this stuff. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of dealing with them. The society here, our state — the majority of the state — is sick of dealing with this nonsense.”
Marshall spoke to KyCIR last week about the confrontation, new anti-trans laws and how they connect to the threat of violence and other harms trans people face in their daily lives.
“There are many people in our community we have lost and buried due to violence that is spurred by rhetoric like this reverend (Wesley) was spewing, who simply doesn’t know. I’m sure that he hasn’t had any interactions with a trans individual before,” Marshall said.
“If he would like to sit down and have a conversation amicably — one that isn’t, you know, fueled in hate, anger and frustration — I’m more than happy to sit down and have a conversation with him, because I believe in forgiveness.”
She and other trans Kentuckians say they are pulling together, at a scary time for their communities, to support each other, while also hoping to spark more public support from allies.
 How new state law limits health care for Marshall, other trans Kentuckians

In Kentucky, Republican lawmakers have offered various reasons for advancing anti-trans legislation, from their personal beliefs about gender and their support for parental rights, free speech and religious liberty.
They also say they disagree with the medical and psychology professions’ consensus that gender-affirming care is evidence-based and medically necessary for some trans patients.
  Senate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, sponsored a bill that will end government-paid, gender-affirming hormone therapy for trans people in Kentucky prisons and jails. (LRC Public Information)
“There are people that have made a determination that smoking was good for you, and they thought it was medically necessary, but come to find out, it was not,” Republican Sen. Mike Wilson of Bowling Green said while promoting one of the anti-trans laws the legislature passed in March. “So a lot of times, things that are determined by the medical association or a psychiatric association are not really medically necessary.”
Wilson sponsored Senate Bill 2, which will end government-paid, gender-affirming hormone therapy for trans people in Kentucky prisons and jails. A state agency has said it affects 67 incarcerated trans people currently receiving hormone treatments.
The other law the legislature’s GOP supermajority approved this year is House Bill 495, which:

Will end Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming medical care for trans adults.
Immediately reversed a directive by Gov. Andy Beshear that forbade government spending on a dangerous, scientifically discredited practice called “conversion therapy,” which tries to change LGBTQ+ people’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

As lawmakers voted for HB 495 in March, a couple Republicans expressed doubt that Medicaid is actually paying for anyone’s hormone therapy in Kentucky.
Marshall told KyCIR the government health insurer has been paying for her hormone therapy. That access, she says, has given her “an opportunity to live as my authentic self.”
Major medical and psychological associations agree gender-affirming health care is evidence-based, can be life-saving and should be accessible. But now, Republican legislators are ending her ability to affordably access professionally recommended treatment through Medicaid.
“There was a time in my life when it was real dark. I didn’t see the other side of the tunnel. Now, where I’m at in my transition, I can see that light,” she said. “Now I look in the mirror and I’m like, ‘That’s me.’ And to be able to do that is such a gift. And they are slowly taking that away from us,” she said of the Republican-run Kentucky legislature.
“They took it away from kids. They took it away from incarcerated trans and gender-diverse people. And now they’re taking it away from adults who have jumped through hoops and hurdles to even get to this position,” Marshall said, explaining that she saw a gender therapist consistently before she got a recommendation to receive hormone therapy.
“So it’s world-shifting when you have access, and it’s world-destroying when you lose that access,” she told KyCIR.
 Marshall, Wesley share perspectives after confrontation outside Capitol bathroom

As Republican legislators greenlit their two new anti-trans laws last month, Marshall went to the Kentucky Capitol for a “Trans Joy Party” in support of trans people and their rights. The event itself, she said, was “fabulous.”
But something else happened, too: She was confronted by Wesley, the GOP representative from Ravenna, for the bathroom she used — leading to social media and news coverage.
“I go to the restroom to fix my eyelashes and throw on some lipstick. Got that taken care of. But on my way out, all of a sudden, I am surrounded by Capitol police officers and a very irate representative — who I refer to as ‘mis-representative.’ Because they misrepresented themselves, they misrepresented the facts, they misrepresented the law, and they misrepresented me,” she said.
Wesley was standing outside the women’s restroom, accompanied by state police, when he confronted Marshall and made it clear he didn’t want her using that bathroom.
Wesley said he was walking past when someone asked him to do something about Marshall’s presence in the women’s restroom.
“And I said, ‘I’ll deal with that mess right now,’” he told KyCIR.
Wesley said his actions are about “the protection of our women’s privacy and their God-given rights.”
“I’m going to be my brother’s keeper,” he said. “When the daddies are not around, or when … the wives are with their kids and their husbands are not around, yeah, I’m going to be a voice for them men and them grandfathers.”
In social media posts and interviews, Wesley has misgendered Marshall, disregarded the validity of trans people’s identities and used a sexually charged slur to refer to trans women who use women’s bathrooms.
“There’s a lot of confusion on this end, and I’m not going to buy into it. I ain’t going to drink the Kool-Aid,” Wesley told KyCIR this week. “I’m going to protect our children, and I’m going to stand up for our women’s rights to their privacy in their bathrooms and locker rooms.”
Evidence does not support claims that letting trans people use bathrooms that match their gender identity endangers other people.
Research, including a recent report by UCLA’s Williams Institute, shows it’s not uncommon for trans people to face verbal harassment and physical assault when they use public bathrooms, and data suggest the risk is higher if laws restrict which facilities they can use.
  Carma Bell Marshall was at the Kentucky Capitol for a “Trans Joy Party” in support of trans people and their rights on the day Rep. Bill Wesley confronted her outside a women’s restroom. “Our worth is not defined by policies that try to erase us,” she said earlier this month during an observance in Louisville of the international Trans Day of Visibility.

“It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Marshall said of Wesley’s confronting her at the Capitol. “I harmed no one. He doesn’t have dominion over that bathroom.”
Kentucky passed a law in 2023 that restricts which bathrooms trans students can use in public schools.
Wesley has said he intends to propose further anti-trans bathroom restrictions next year and indicated to KyCIR that he would support arresting trans women who use women’s bathrooms.
“Our whole culture should not change because there’s a bunch of confused people out there,” he said. “No, I’m not going to deal with it. I’m going to fight against it every step of the way.”
 LGBTQ+ people face higher risk of violence, research shows

Wesley’s confrontation with Marshall, and the Kentucky legislature’s passage of two new anti-trans laws, are happening at a time when anti-trans messaging and legislation are increasingly prevalent in U.S. culture, particularly in right-wing political circles.
Jaz Brown works for the Kentucky Health Justice Network and said, at last week’s Trans Day of Visibility event in Louisville, that legislators are causing real harm by passing bills like HB 495 and SB 2.
“I often see the fear in the eyes of parents who just want their kids to survive when they should be thriving,” Brown said. “I console those who are considering putting off their transition due to genuine safety concerns — due to the concerns of being a victim of a hate crime — as transphobic rhetoric continues to be on the rise.”
UCLA’s Williams Institute recently analyzed federal survey data and found LGBT individuals are five times likelier than other people to be victimized by violent crime, and nine times likelier to be targeted by a violent hate crime.
Overall, Black LGBT people were victimized at the highest rates, and research shows Black trans women are at higher risk of being murdered in the U.S.
KyCIR asked Wesley about his perspective on concerns that anti-trans rhetoric, such as public comments he made after confronting Marshall, has the potential to spur violent attacks on trans people.
Wesley said he “could see why” someone would act violently toward a trans woman for using a women’s bathroom.
“I’m not saying that I’m aggressive towards them, but I’m going to say this: I better not catch a man in my little girl’s bathroom,” Wesley said. “I’m just saying that. And I’m being blunt.”
 Trans Kentuckians support each other as they’re targeted by government actions

Last week, about 50 people gathered by the Big Four Bridge for a “Celebration of Trans Life.”
Event organizers set up fake tombstones to represent a funeral for bigotry and various forms of oppression. Painted phrases on them read: “Here lies” sexism, colonialism and ignorance.
Alexander Griggs, a Fairness Campaign staffer who is Marshall’s partner and helps her lead the local Transgender Wellness Coalition, spoke about how gender-expansive people grew up with societal beliefs that argue “we shouldn’t be here.”
“And I want to stand here today to tell each and every gender-expansive person that you do matter. That we are standing up here today because you matter. We are speaking out through our anger because you matter,” he said.
Griggs went on to say: “We are not asking you today, as we stand visible on the Trans Day of Visibility, to dismiss or ignore your pain. We are asking you to let joy dwell alongside it. And my call to action … is to embody the mission and vision of the Trans Wellness Coalition: To be a soft place to land for somebody else, to be a supportive hand to hold for somebody else and to be a safe place for somebody else to grow.”
Other people at the event offered similar sentiments. They spoke about how nerve-wracking it can be to show up publicly as a trans person right now, about how state laws are harming trans kids and adults, and how they’re doing what they can to support people during a fearful time.
Marshall told KyCIR it’s important for allies of trans and gender-diverse communities to recognize “your voice and action is needed now.”
“Silence is complicity. We are actively being erased,” she said. “You have to find a way to get engaged, whether that’s going and speaking with your representatives face-to-face in Frankfort, whether that’s calling and leaving a message, whether that’s sending an email, whether that’s meeting us at some of our rallies and events. Find ways to stand in that gap with us because we need your strength.”
She also echoed a common sentiment about Republican politicians’ pursuit of anti-trans policies, especially since Trump regained office: Trans people and their rights aren’t, and won’t be, the only ones targeted.
“And I’m afraid that as they keep whittling away at things, this is like the old adage: ‘What’s the best way to pluck a chicken? One feather at a time.’ And we’re just the first feather on that chicken,” she said. “So don’t be the next feather. Stand with us right now so you don’t have to worry about your feather getting plucked.”

(Wisconsin Department of Corrections photo)The Wisconsin Department of Corrections held its first friends and family forum at Fox Lake Correctional Institution on Wednesday. The event was closed to the press, but multiple attendees shared their reactions with the Examiner. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
DOC Secretary Jared Hoy and much of the department’s leadership team met with over 40 friends and family members, according to a DOC press release. 
“Family and friends play a huge role in determining whether an individual succeeds in the community,” Hoy said. “With DOC’s mission of safety and rehabilitation, we need to partner with families and friends throughout the process. Their support is crucial to success with rehabilitation.”
Rebecca Aubart, executive director of the prison reform advocacy group Ladies of SCI, said the event gave her hope. 
“We have been a lost, hopeless group of people without a voice for decades,” Aubart said. “And they acknowledged us, they were respectful and kind and compassionate to us. And they gave us hope. The dangerous thing about this is, if you crush our hope, we are going to be devastated and come in full force with whatever we could possibly do to make sure that everybody knows they did not follow through on anything.” 
The prison system has faced scrutiny amid deaths of incarcerated people, lockdowns at state prisons and criminal charges against the former Waupun Correctional Institution warden and members of his staff. In November, the DOC signed a contract with a management and consulting firm for a third-party review. 
People who attended the event broke into small groups to talk about topics such as strengthening families, treatment and health care, classification and life in DOC facilities, complaint systems and reentry, the DOC’s statement said. DOC staff were there to listen and take note of suggestions. 
Amy Rolack said her husband is incarcerated at Fox Lake Correctional Institution. She said she told DOC staff at the forum that her husband was told it would be a year and a half before he would be seen for dental care. 
“I think that it was a really good meeting as far as who all attended it and who were all able to hear all of these loved ones talking about their experiences in each different facility,” Rolack said. 
Betty Ziehme described it as a successful first meeting. 
“I don’t think they were shocked by what they heard,” Ziehme said. “I think that they are aware that there’s issues, and I think they’re looking for input, and that they want to make some corrections. And I have to be hopeful.”
People who attended the event “made valuable suggestions” regarding visiting experiences and helping support families new to the Department of Corrections, Hoy said, according to DOC. 
In an interview with the Examiner, Aubart mentioned the idea of having family orientations. She also pointed to neighboring Minnesota, where the Office of the Ombudsperson for Corrections (OBFC) — a prison oversight body — collaborated with the Minnesota Department of Corrections on a pilot project intended to strengthen loved ones’ support of incarcerated people.
The project included virtual meetings for family and friends of incarcerated people for two prisons. One of the prisons was an intake facility where most incarcerated people would only stay a few months before being transferred to a different facility. In that group, OBFC presented on topics families identified as being helpful, and afterward, staff members gave updates related to the facility and participants asked questions. 
An OBFC report found the meetings were a helpful resource for families and facility staff developed a better understanding of difficulties experienced by families navigating the correctional system.
Prior to the pilot project, a 2021 Minnesota OBFC report found that families “face a wide array of barriers in supporting and staying connected with their loved one while they are incarcerated.” 
After the small groups, Hoy answered some of the questions friends and family had submitted in advance. The answers to additional questions will be available on the DOC’s friends and family webpage in the coming days.
Hoy said it is important for the department to consider the opinions, ideas and feelings of people directly impacted by their work. 
Attendance at forums is limited to friends and family members of people who are currently incarcerated or on active community supervision, a DOC webpage says. The DOC’s website includes an email where questions could be submitted virtually. 
The forum was “the first in a series of efforts designed to continue improving communication” between the department and the loved ones of incarcerated people and people on supervision, according to DOC. 
The department stated that it will continue to receive feedback from attendees for potential forums in the future or other events. Hoy said the department wants to know what family and friends want from events like this.

(Stock.adobe.com photo by Nimur.)Environmentalists who feared an extensive rollback of one of the state’s signature climate programs, instead managed to escape this year’s legislative session with what they say are just revisions to the Building Energy Performance Standards.
The BEPS program, adopted as part of the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022, requires large buildings in the state to electrify over time, and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, or pay fees.
This year, lawmakers exempted hospitals from the rules, amid other changes, but largely left the program intact to the relief of environmentalists.
“BEPS was trimmed, not cut down,” said Jamie DeMarco, a lobbyist for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
CCAN initially supported House Bill 49, which would have given buildings some more flexibility, including with a waiver program for specific cases. The Maryland Department of the Environment, which enforces building emissions rules, proposed the bill.
But midway through the legislative session, lawmakers began discussing broader modifications to the rules, including exempting residential buildings and hospitals, said Brittany Baker, CCAN’s Maryland director.
“Once we were having these BEPS conversations, legislators had all of this angst … about BEPS, that now they wanted to attach all of these weakening amendments to the bill,” Baker said.
Moore issues executive order that could delay EV sales penalties

That came about the same time that a bill rolling back Maryland’s electric vehicles program was advancing in the legislature. Ultimately, that bill failed, but not before Gov. Wes Moore issued a similar executive order, allowing his administration to pause penalties for the first two years of the EV program, which requires manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of electric cars in Maryland.
“This legislative session was a tough, tough few months,” read an online post from CCAN. “However, our advocacy changed the trajectory of the session in a tangible way.”
Residential buildings don’t appear in the passed bill, which is on the governor’s desk. But hospitals were exempted, and emissions associated with steam sterilization and back-up generators at medical facilities, nursing homes and laboratories are also exempt under the bill.
“We think it was unnecessary. No other BEPS in the country exempts hospitals,” DeMarco said. “But that’s what happened.”
Prior to this year’s bill, historic buildings, elementary and secondary schools, manufacturing buildings, agricultural buildings and federal buildings could all apply to be exempted from BEPS.
In testimony on the original bill, the Maryland Hospital Association pushed for lawmakers to exclude hospitals, arguing that they are held to unique HVAC standards, and intensive care units, emergency rooms and operating rooms need “continuous and guaranteed access to power.”
“While hospitals support efforts to combat climate change, the unique nature of hospitals — and the potentially deadly consequences of power failure on patient safety — requires special consideration for an exemption,” wrote Natasha Mehu, vice president of government affairs and policy at MHA.
This year’s bill also clarified the relationship between the state and a similar building emissions program established in Montgomery County, in a way DeMarco called “fair and reasonable”: It lets MDE certify county-level programs and waive the state rules for buildings in counties that have approved regulations.
Tom Ballentine, vice president for policy and government relations for Maryland NAIOP, a commercial real estate association, said the change reconciles “overlapping requirements at the state and local level” and lets building owners focus on Montgomery’s rules, which include earlier deadlines.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Buildings — with fossil-fuel burning furnaces, water heaters and stoves — contributed 16% of Maryland’s greenhouse gas emissions as of 2020. Under state law, Maryland’s overall emissions must be net-zero by 2045.
In addition to reducing emissions, Maryland’s BEPS program requires large buildings (over 35,000 square feet) to reduce their “energy use intensity,” which measures annual energy use per square foot. The exact reductions haven’t been set yet, after the General Assembly required MDE last year to take in energy use data from buildings first.
Ballentine said that the energy use regulations represent an “expansion of the policy scope that needs some consideration,” because it goes beyond greenhouse gas emissions.
“The way that energy efficiency has been managed in the past is through building and energy codes that are developed through a process that puts a high value on technical feasibility and cost effectiveness,” Ballentine said. “MDE doesn’t have that same mandate.”
The bill exempted buildings with permanent “sensitive compartmented information facilities,” or SCIFs, owned by certain federal agencies, from the energy use requirements. These facilities are essentially secure rooms where classified information is discussed, protected by security technology.
DeMarco said he would have preferred to see SCIFs themselves exempted from the rules, rather than any building that contains a SCIF.
“The fear is that any data center, if it wants to be exempted from energy-use intensity, could just find a SCIF to be contained in it. But most data centers right now do not have SCIFs,” DeMarco said.
Lawmakers approve energy reform bills aimed at cutting rates, boosting in-state generation

Meanwhile, BEPS waivers focused on economic feasibility were stricken from the bill.
The energy use regulations are a “co-equal pillar” of the BEPS rules, DeMarco said, because they help prevent building owners from purchasing cheaper yet more inefficient electric heating systems, forcing tenants to deal with high bills.
As originally introduced, this year’s bill, which came from MDE, would have set up alternative compliance payments for the energy use segments — instead of only the greenhouse gas emissions. But that language was scrapped from the bill.
Ballentine said the fees were set far too high. Using data from Montgomery County, his association estimated that the worst performing condominium building might have paid up to $600,000 per year.
“I was very surprised, actually, that in a session where the BGE bill impacts of increased energy costs and power surcharges were such an item of discussion, the energy intensity fee didn’t get more attention,” Ballentine said. “Because it is big for some buildings. It’s a substantial number.
With MDE’s backing, the fees may resurface in the legislature.
Getting the balance right is critical, DeMarco said. The fees must be high enough to encourage building owners to make the building renovations, but low enough that they don’t bankrupt building owners who cannot comply.
“It essentially caps how much any building will ever have to pay, and knowing that there’s an upper bound of how much you would ever have to pay provides a lot of beneficial certainty,” DeMarco said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_412644909-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-11 06:00:18.147182

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)As someone with the lived experience of battling addiction — to include the criminal record that often goes hand in hand with the disease — Rachel Alderman is among the best-suited people to help others cope. 
Alderman is a peer recovery specialist and community health worker at the Community Health Center of the New River Valley, where she helps people overcome drug addiction. Lately, she’s felt a fresh sense of pride in her role, since new federal and state efforts to support these types of mental health workers have made headway.
But it’s often been challenging for professionals like her to land their dream job because it’s common for people coping with substance use disorders to have also entered the criminal justice system. 
Then their past convictions, time-served, probation status or fines still owed can prevent them from obtaining many types of jobs. In Alderman’s case, her possession charges could have prevented her from working in the field, if not for law changes and permissive employers. 
While private or nonprofit organizations have been able to more freely hire people with certain criminal records, state or federal-funded facilities often can’t. 
Virginia state lawmakers have chipped away at some of these barriers over the years and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, now hopes to support those efforts nationwide. 
 Peer to peer support

Peer recovery specialists like Alderman interface directly with patients and collaborate with clinical social workers or medical officers to help patients address their physical and mental health while they try to overcome their addiction. 
Alderman always had an interest in working in the mental health field, but her struggles with substance use disorder held her back. When she was seeking care from clinicians, she said it was a visit with a peer recovery specialist who helped her both recover and realize her professional pathway was still possible. 
“I knew my clinicians cared about me. I knew that they wanted to see me get better, but they didn’t really get (how addiction feels). And then this guy comes in, and somehow he’s figured it out,” Alderman explained. “So I’m like ‘Well he did it, so maybe I’ll listen to his suggestions that I might have been hard-headed against at first.’”
This week, Kaine and Indiana Republican Sen. Jim Banks introduced the Providing Empathetic and Effective Recovery (PEER) Support Act. If it becomes law, it would direct the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the U.S. Department of Justice to study states’ screening processes for peer support specialists and examine which factors are barriers for certification or hiring.
This matters, Kaine said, because not every state has taken the steps to reform that workforce the way that Virginia has. The bill would also direct the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to revise the Standard Operational Classification system to recognize peer support specialists as a profession to help ensure data reporting on the field. 
His bill is “driven by conversations” he’s had with his constituents around the state, Kaine said. 
“It is only acts like this bill that hopefully will allow for these changes to be made,” said Michelle Brauns, Community Health Center of New River Valley’s CEO. 
Kaine also suggested that he believes his bill can inspire more public esteem for the work peer support specialists do.
“Let’s raise the respect for this profession,” Kaine said. 
Alderman said it could also boost respect for people recovering from addictions.
“We’re often seen as less-than or not a whole person,” Alderman said. “This kind of recognition on this kind of level really feels good.” 
While his efforts at the federal level can’t overwrite the way states regulate their professionals, Kaine said that the PEER Act can help guide the way for states to rethink how they regulate peer recovery specialists. 
It’s something Virginia has already been tackling. Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, and Sen. Todd Pillion, R-Washington, passed legislation to prevent certain criminal convictions from barring people from peer recovery work. Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed their bills last year. 
Other barriers have also been addressed in the statehouse, such as a bill this year by Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Charlottesville, which t eliminates the need to have paid off any owed fines or fees to be considered for peer recovery jobs. Youngkin signed this bill, too.
“If you can’t get a job that you’re best-poised to do, how do we expect people to ever be able to pay?” Price said. 
Price also emphasized the racial disparities at play in the criminal justice system. She noted that people of color are more likely to have interactions with law enforcement, so people of color with substance use disorders are also more likely to serve time as a result of their disease. But the bipartisan work she and others have achieved in this space is something she wants to see continue. 
While Kaine has introduced his bill previously, he’s said he is hopeful this time it will gain more traction and pass, particularly since it has bipartisan support from numerous cosponsors.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Charles Cross Jr. 62, signed a report that claimed Andry José Hernandez, 30, a gay Venezuelan citizen who worked as a make-up artist, was linked to the Tren de Aragua gang and cited his tattoos. Cross, now employed by the private prison company CoreCivic, left MPD under a cloud of conduct and credibility problems, which also landed him on the Brady list of untrustworthy officers maintained by the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office.
In 2012 when he held the rank of sergeant at MPD, Cross was fired after driving his car into a family’s home while he was intoxicated. Cross was allowed to resign after appealing the decision to the Fire and Police Commission (FPC). The Journal Sentinel also reports that Cross was being investigated for claiming overtime he allegedly hadn’t earned when he was fired from the department.
Prior to the crash, Cross had been placed on the Brady list after kicking in the door of an apartment shared with his girlfriend and threatening to kill himself with his service revolver. The incident, in 2007,  cost him his job, but Cross was reinstated after appealing to the FPC. Four months after he separated from MPD in 2012, Cross was hired by CoreCivic, the Journal Sentinel reported. 
According to court filings, Cross identified himself as an “investigator” in a form claiming Hernandez was part of Tren de Aragua, one of the gangs that the Trump administration says it is targeting through mass deportations and detentions of non-citizens. Hernandez had tattoos depicting crowns with the words “dad” and “mom.” Hernandez’s attorneys say the crowns are a reference to the “Three Kings” festival in his hometown of Capacho, Venezuela, and are not connected to Tren de Aragua, as Cross reportedly assumed.  
Hernandez was one of more than 200 mostly Venezuelan migrants sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center. Authorities at the prison have been accused of human rights violations and torture. 
Hernandez fled Venezuela fearing persecution for being a gay man, as well as for his political views. The Journal Sentinel reports that after entering the U.S. illegally, he was apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents and sent to Mexico, where he made an appointment and presented himself at a port of entry in San Diego. Hernandez was asked about his tattoos by federal agents, who named him as a “suspect,” but didn’t check any of the other categories on the questionnaire such as “intelligence information received from other agencies” or “group photos.” Since he was deported to El Salvador, Hernandez has not been able to reach his lawyers. 
The developments have raised questions about the involvement of private contractors in immigration and deportation actions, as well as the ability of police officers with problematic histories to be hired by private companies like CoreCivic.

However, the shortage of health care educators is often overlooked. It will be impossible to ramp up enrollment and prepare an adequate number of students to fill these gaps until we fill the thousands of faculty chairs sitting empty in Virginia and across the country .  
Even before I got my degree, I began my health career as an emergency medical technician. Eventually, I worked to become a nurse, an educator, and a hospital and nursing school leader. In each of these roles, I’ve seen how our shortage of health care educators directly impacts our ability to sustain the workforce and care for patients. 
In a vicious cycle, the lack of educators limits the number of interested and qualified students a school or program can accept. In nursing, surveys by the Virginia Department of Health Professions and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing found a lack of sufficient faculty as one of the main reasons tens of thousands of qualified candidates were not admitted to nursing programs. In the Career and Technical Education (CTE) field, which is vital to certifying allied health professionals like medical assistants, 71% of CTE program directors report a shortage of health sciences teachers and high faculty turnover due to factors like working in high-growth, hard-to-staff fields and opportunities to earn more in non-teaching employment. 
This is causing a net reduction in the number of students participating in health science coursework. Virginia’s Department of Education lists career and technical educators in its top 10 list of critical teacher shortages in the state and expects the shortage to worsen over the next five years. As a result of fewer qualified students participating in health science education, the talent pool of future medical professionals and educators is shrinking.
Demand for critical healthcare professionals, including medical assistants, home health aides and nursing assistants, will surpass 10 million as soon as 2026, according to one study. But if current trends hold, 6.5 million individuals will permanently leave these jobs while only 1.9 million will replace them. We’re seeing similar shortages in other health roles: 42% of employers say it’s difficult to find qualified pharmacy technicians and the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics projects a need for over 197,000 additional registered nurses. Virginia alone will need 4,190 additional nurses each year for the next five years to meet that demand.
If we hope to solve this crisis, we must lean into innovation to better support and grow the health care educator workforce. We can do this by shifting our focus to better develop and support the individuals charged with preparing the next generation of medical professionals.
A key reason behind the growing shortage of healthcare educators is that most practitioners rarely consider entering academia as an advancement opportunity for their careers. There are too few resources — grants, scholarships, training opportunities, and competitive salaries — available to recruit and support practitioners’ transition from clinician to educator.  
Once in the academic workforce, we also need to provide better resources to support those educators. Many faculty are overwhelmed and burned out – some are retiring early, and one report estimates that nearly one-third of current nursing faculty are expected to retire by next year. If we hope to retain these educators, we must invest in innovative methods like clinical simulation and educational technology tools that help digital-native students better learn and remediate skills while lessening the work burden on faculty. 
Policymakers must also support efforts to help recruit and retain educators, and grant programs must take a more holistic approach to help support health care academia. While some have proposed grant programs to help close the pay gap between clinical nursing and nurse faculty roles, let’s think beyond just nursing. Legislation should also aim to combat the shortage of health care educators in other settings like CTE high school programs, adult career centers, and community colleges, which would expand allied health career training opportunities. 
I commend Virginia lawmakers for taking an interest in addressing the growing shortage of CTE educators through bipartisan legislation like Senate Bill 879 and House Bill 2018, which were considered this past session. It’s important that lawmakers recognize this crisis, and I urge them to continue pursuing efforts to solve it.
But lawmakers should also consider legislation that helps bolster the productivity and capacity of educators. We cannot recruit our way out of this shortage – we need to provide current educators with the support they need to effectively and efficiently teach more students without feeling overwhelmed.  
I, like many others, felt a calling to become a health care professional and have had an extremely rewarding career caring for patients and teaching students. With so many passionate students eager to begin their own health care career journey, we must do everything we can to ensure we have the faculty to teach them.

Wes Moore's first foreign trade mission, they ""did not anticipate that we would be in the middle of a trade war,"" but that made it all the more important to go, Moore said Thursday.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) in a January file photo. The governor this week discussed his first trip overseas, which he said is aimed at broadening the state's economic base with more private investment. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears / Maryland Matters)When administration officials began planning Gov. Wes Moore’s first foreign trade mission, they “did not anticipate that we would be in the middle of a trade war,” but that made it all the more important to go, Moore said Thursday.
Moore, who leaves Friday for a week in Japan and South Korea, emphasized that he hopes to use his trip to Japan and South Korea to send international partners a message that Maryland is open for business, regardless of the “erratic” measures being announced — and put on hold — by President Donald Trump.
“The idea of consistency and standing up for your friends does matter,” Moore said in a Thursday briefing with reporters. “We’ve actually heard from some of our partners who have said, ‘Thank you for still coming.’ Because … we know that relationships are being strained.”
The trade mission is not just symbolic, though – Moore says that the two countries he will visit on his mission make good strategic partners and that he expects to come back with “direct and distinct economic deliverables.”
“We already have really strong relationships with them,” Moore said of the countries he will be visiting. “We just know that there’s not just a lot that’s already being done, but a lot more that we can do within Korea. I’d say the same thing with Japan.
Moore specifically mentioned that Japan is a strong trade partner when it comes to developing what he calls Maryland’s “lighthouse industries” — aerospace, life sciences and cyber.
“When you’re looking at our lighthouse industries, there’s no stronger partner internationally that we have than Japan,” Moore said, specifically mentioning cyber, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and IT.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In terms of deliverables, Moore said that he is looking to bring back “real relationships” and “growth opportunities,” part of a push to diversify and strengthen Maryland’s economy. It is a goal that Moore has put front and center since the beginning of the 2025 legislative session in January.
Maryland Republicans, while supporting Moore’s goals to grow the state’s economy, have been skeptical of whether he has actually lived up to his lofty aims.
“I don’t think they were met very well,” House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said Monday on the last day of legislative session. Buckel went on to say that “very few” of the governor’s efforts to promote private-sector growth seemed to survive on the last day of session.
Moore, though, says that this trip, coming days after the legislative session, fits right in with his efforts to fix a Maryland economy that in January found itself too dependent on the federal government and staring down a massive deficit and a shifting landscape in Washington.
“We’ve got to get economic growth,” Moore said, “and it means that economic growth cannot rely on Washington, D.C., that we’ve got to be able to diversify.”
Moore is sheduled to leave Friday for Japan, head to South Korea on Tuesday and be back in the U.S. next Friday. Stops in Japan include visits with Toyota, Hitachi and Japan Airlines, participation in a quantum roundtable and an investment seminar, and a ride on the maglev “Bullet Train.” In South Korea, he has meetings scheduled at Samsung and Korean Aerospace Industries, as well as visits with Cabinet-level officials there.
Moore stressed that the diversification of Maryland’s economic portfolio that his trip is meant to foster is not a luxury, but rather a necessity.
“The only way out,” Moore said, “is growth. And it means we have to be able to not just explore, but also really move further into these areas and these industries where we know we’re going to have long-term growth opportunities, but Maryland has not participated in that growth.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0253-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-11 06:00:18.147182

(Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Professionals)Hospital closures, buyouts, and service closures continue to rise in Pennsylvania, part of a troubling statewide trend. 
As the latest examples, Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Delaware County is in real danger of closing entirely, despite efforts by many stakeholders to keep it open, and UPMC Cole in Potter County recently closed its Labor and Delivery department.
These closures have serious consequences for communities.
Crozer-Chester is a critical safety net facility in a densely populated and low-income area of Delaware County. Its closure would have dire implications for local access to emergency services, trauma care, psychiatric care, maternity care, neonatal care, and more. Hospitals in the surrounding area would face increased demand that they would struggle to meet. Wait times would grow, and ultimately, local residents would be unable to access lifesaving care when they need it most.

Likewise, UPMC Cole’s shuttering of maternity care services will mean pregnant women in a rural part of Pennsylvania will travel longer distances to receive appropriate care, potentially putting their lives in danger.
These disastrous scenarios are not unique. 
In the past 20 years, the rate of hospital closures and shuttering of core services in Pennsylvania has been rising at an alarming rate. Across the state, 32 hospitals have closed completely, and another 25 have shuttered core services like emergency care or maternity care since 2004. 
Some communities have lost their only hospital; some no longer have a reliable local emergency room. In rural Pennsylvania, an entire seven-county area now lacks any hospital-based maternity care.
Hospital closures rarely come out of nowhere. An analysis conducted by PHAN last year found that 90% of hospital closures are preceded by a merger or acquisition that eventually leads to financial distress. 
This is how Crozer-Chester found itself in danger of closing. Prospect Medical Holdings, a California-based private equity firm, purchased Crozer Health in 2016, overextended itself financially over time while paying generous dividends to its investors, and eventually filed for bankruptcy this January, leaving a catastrophe in its wake.
Private equity firms aren’t the only culprit. 
Non-profit hospital system UPMC has grown over time by acquiring smaller health systems and individual hospitals. In 2017, they acquired Sunbury Community Hospital and Lock Haven Hospital, telling the local communities that, “bringing these hospitals into our family allows us to reinvest in both facilities to improve access, enhance care and grow existing services.” 
Contrary to what they said, Susquehanna Sunbury was closed in 2020, and Lock Haven’s inpatient services were terminated in 2023. This week, they closed UPMC Cole’s Labor and Delivery department.

Concerningly, hospital mergers and acquisitions, which often lead to closures over time, are booming across Pennsylvania with 148 transactions taking place since 2004 and more slated to come. When hospital mergers and acquisitions are proposed, promises are almost always made that the transaction will actually make access to healthcare in the local area better, not worse. 
But those promises are typically not kept. Some mergers and acquisitions turn out to be neutral, or even positive, for the local community, but some end in disaster.
That’s why it’s critically important that communities have more transparency and oversight when hospital mergers and acquisitions are proposed. Fortunately, a solution has been proposed in Harrisburg that would establish much-needed public review and oversight for hospital mergers and acquisitions.
A bill passed on a bipartisan basis in the Pennsylvania House and in Committee in the Pennsylvania Senate last session would empower the state Attorney General to gather the facts about all significant proposed hospital mergers  and acquisitions, hear from community members about their concerns, evaluate the impact on communities, patients, and access to care, and take legal action to protect communities from the serious negative impacts of hospital consolidation when needed. 
The legislation would also empower the state Attorney General’s Office  to track the promises made during an acquisition and take legal action when those promises are not kept. Just after its acquisition of Crozer Health, a spokesperson promised that Prospect would “increase the ability of Crozer-Keystone facilities to modernize, attract more patients and expand services” and “maintain critical service lines and expand service offerings in the community to help ensure growth and sustainability.” 
This statement is typical of the promises made during a merger or acquisition– and far from the truth. In addition to the potential closure of Crozer-Chester, Prospect also closed Delaware County Memorial and Springfield Hospitals in 2023.
Pennsylvania can prevent harmful scenarios like the ones Crozer-Chester Medical Center and UPMC Cole are facing. The General Assembly must bring this legislation to the floor before more communities are put at risk of losing access to lifesaving care.

The eighteen senators signing onto the letter believe that without immediate and decisive action, the tariffs will inflict lasting damage on the state’s economy.
“Our furniture manufacturers in High Point and Hickory, our thriving auto dealerships, our agricultural sector that feeds America and the world, and countless small businesses that form the backbone of our communities will all bear the crushing weight of these misguided trade policies. Moreover, every North Carolina family will feel the sting of higher prices at a time when many are still recovering from recent economic challenges,” write the state senators.
The letter urges the congressional delegation to think about how soybean farmers in Eastern North Carolina could lose access to vital markets in a trade war, and furniture makers in Thomasville could see raw materials increase dramatically, while auto plant workers could see their job security threatened as Americans dial back their spending.
The state senators are urging Republicans and Democrats alike to introduce and support legislation to rescind the tariffs immediately, and form a united front that puts the economic welfare of citizens above partisan considerations.
“The time for action is not tomorrow, or next week, or after the next election cycle. The time is now.”
President Donald Trump placed a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries Wednesday, but opted to increase tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. And while investors were initially exuberant with the pause — briefly sending markets skyrocketing — the mood soured by Thursday erasing a large chunk of Wednesday’s recovery.
Republican Congressman Chuck Edwards (NC-11) told a group of western North Carolina business owners last week that he supported Trump’s use of the tariffs for leverage.
Democratic Congresswoman Deborah Ross (NC-02) said the tariff flip-flop by Trump has only harmed working-class families and wiped out trillions of dollars in investments.
“To be clear, the 10 percent baseline tariff that remains in place will continue to raise prices for consumers and hurt North Carolina families. It’s time for Republicans in Congress to stop giving Trump a free pass as he threatens to upend the global economy and start standing up for the American people,” said Ross in a statement released by her office.
On Thursday a new study from the Yale Budget Lab suggested the tariffs could increase expenses across the board, costing an average loss per household of $4,700 this year.

This dynamic is exactly what we are seeing when it comes to elections in Michigan. We are not seeing good faith efforts to improve our elections and make them more fair to voters. Instead, we’re seeing an all-out assault on voting rights. In fact, we can put Tuesday, March 25, 2025 into the history books as the day the all-out assault was revealed with a two-faced approach.
Earlier that day, a handful of Michigan legislators appealed a ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. These legislators want to overturn very popular voting reforms that Michiganders have approved directly in recent years – early voting and an independent redistricting commission.
Michigan , and the legislature approved the laws needed to enact the reforms. The courts have ruled against these rogue Republican legislators twice already. Even still, they are desperate to override Michigan voters, the legislature, and two federal court rulings.
They argue an extreme theory that gives state legislators excessive and dangerous power to exert total control over our elections without any checks or balances. This would allow them to ignore our voting rights as they see fit, like limiting voting to Election Day only or even shrinking the window to vote on Election Day. They want complete and total control over elections that the Michigan Constitution does not give them.
Now here’s the two-face, that same day, President Donald Trump released an executive order that would be a complete federal takeover of Michigan elections. Presidents can’t set election laws, but that’s not stopping Trump and his administration from trying.
The executive order would also undo popular reforms Michiganders have supported before, and it would override the state legislature and Congress as the decision-making venues when it comes to election laws. Did we hear a peep of criticism from those Michigan representatives who appealed their legal loss? Not a word.
So, to clarify, one face is demanding individual state legislators have control to overturn popular voting rights, and the other face is demanding a White House takeover of our elections to overturn voting rights. Both sides are seeking to dismantle our democracy based on 5-year-old lies.
While there may be multiple faces, extremists have one shared goal – they want to restrict your right to vote, and they want to pick who gets to vote. These attempts have different names – House Joint Resolution B, a legal appeal, a new ballot initiative with a deceiving name. But they have the same sinister goal.
We cannot allow our voice at the ballot box to be blocked. We cannot allow a president to implement his tyrannical agenda on elections. We cannot allow the Constitution to be so bluntly violated again and again.
Call your state legislator and let them know how you feel about voting rights. Don’t know who represents you? Use our tool here to find the elected officials who you need to reach out to.
We have come too far, and fought too hard, to let our voices, and our votes, be silenced.

(Veronica Gabriela Cardenas, Pool/Getty Images)The Trump administration is moving quickly to dramatically expand the nation’s capacity for detaining immigrants who do not have legal authorization to be in the United States.
The administration has largely turned to the for-profit, private prison industry to reopen or repurpose shuttered and aging facilities — many of which have been previously criticized for poor conditions and inadequate care.
In February, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced it will reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey. The detention facility, owned by private prison company GEO Group, has the capacity to hold about 1,000 people. It will become the largest ICE processing and detention center on the East Coast. The 15-year contract is valued at $1 billion.
Private prison operator CoreCivic also announced it will reopen the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. The family detention site can house up to 2,400 ICE detainees, including children. The new contract will run through at least March 2030.
Private immigration detention is growing fast — again. The Trump administration is rapidly expanding immigration detention through billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic. Dozens of facilities may reopen across at least eight states, including places with long histories of abuse. But while some communities and states are concerned about oversight and are pushing back, others see economic opportunity.
Despite profiling concerns, more law agencies are joining street-level immigration enforcement

President Donald Trump isn’t the first president to rely on private contractors to detain immigrants. Tens of thousands were held in private facilities under both the Obama and Biden administrations.
But the new contracts mark the start of a planned expansion led by Trump’s border adviser, Tom Homan, who has called for boosting ICE’s detention capacity to at least 100,000 people.
Trump has repeatedly touted his goal of staging the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people. There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank.
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told attendees of the 2025 Border Security Expo in Arizona this week that he wants the agency to become as efficient at deporting immigrants as e-commerce giant Amazon is at delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Lyons said, describing his ideal deportation process as “like [Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”
On top of expanding contracts with private operators, the Trump administration also has sent immigrants to detention facilities abroad, including Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in El Salvador.
As of March 23, ICE had 47,892 people in custody, according to the government’s latest detention statistics. Yet the agency requested funding for just 34,000 beds in fiscal year 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s budget documents. ICE, in February, released at least 160 detainees after its network of at least 107 facilities reached 109% capacity, according to internal government statistics obtained by CBS News.

During earnings calls earlier this year with stockholders, both GEO Group and CoreCivic officials described the current landscape as one of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Alongside detention expansion, executives said, they expect increased demand for transportation and electronic monitoring services.
Neither company granted Stateline an interview. In an emailed statement, GEO’s corporate relations director, Christopher Ferreira, wrote: “We are proud of our record of working closely with federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that all persons entrusted to our care are treated in a safe, secure and humane manner.”
In that same statement, Ferreira also confirmed GEO is investing $70 million to expand housing, transportation and monitoring services to meet the federal government’s immigration enforcement goals.
CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, Ryan Gustin, wrote in an email that “the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone — to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed.”
Both companies are now moving quickly to reopen idle facilities, which could happen in just a few months.
‘Emblematic of the immigration detention system’
Private immigration detention dates back to the 1980s, when companies such as CoreCivic — then called Corrections Corporation of America — began operating detention facilities. In 1984, the company converted a Houston motel into a makeshift detention center. Since then, the federal government’s use of private contractors has dramatically increased.
Today, nearly 90% of immigrants in ICE custody are held in privately operated facilities, according to the latest analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research group.

Some immigration advocates say this growth is largely driven by profit.
“The conditions at the privately run facilities are awful, but they’re really emblematic of the immigration detention system as a whole,” Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the immigration rights group Detention Watch Network, told Stateline. “They’re incentivized to cut corners.”
Just last week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted a request inviting contractors to submit bids for new detention facilities, transportation, security personnel, medical services and administrative support. The contracts could total up to $45 billion over the next two years.
Over the next several months, dozens of privately operated ICE detention facilities may open in at least eight states, including California, Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Texas and Washington.
Several states have tried to rein in private detention within their jurisdictions, with varying levels of success.
At least four states — Illinois, Iowa, Nevada and New York — have passed laws banning private prisons, though those measures do not apply to federal immigration detention facilities.










They're incentivized to cut corners.


– Setareh Ghandehari, Detention Watch Network’s advocacy director


Illinois, which outlawed for-profit prisons in the 1990s, passed a law in 2019 that prohibits state, county and local governments from entering into contracts with private companies to run immigration detention centers.
New Mexico legislators are currently considering a similar bill that would prohibit state agencies and local governments from entering into any agreements used to detain immigrants. The bill also would require that any existing agreements end as soon as possible. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
California and New Jersey enacted laws to ban private detention — in 2019 and 2021, respectively. But both laws have been ruled partially unconstitutional, allowing private companies to continue operating.
The judges determined that while the states can bar public agencies or departments from contracting with ICE or private companies, they cannot prevent private companies from entering into contracts and operating facilities within state borders.
The New Jersey attorney general’s office is seeking a federal appeals court hearing to challenge the ruling.
Private detention oversight
Legislators in Washington state are considering a bill that would introduce state-level oversight of privately operated immigration detention facilities.
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

The bill would grant the state Department of Health the authority to inspect privately run detention facilities in Washington. Under the proposal, the department would be able to establish rules regarding access to phones, medical services, running water, lighting and food safety.
State inspectors also would have the authority to enter facilities at any time and impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. The bill passed out of the House and is now under review in the Senate.
Some of the facilities slated to reopen in the coming months, including in Kansas and New Jersey, are already facing challenges related to permits and oversight.
CoreCivic filed paperwork earlier this year to reopen its shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas as an immigration facility. The jail, which closed in 2021, has a documented history of violence and abuse when it was previously run by CoreCivic as a pretrial lockup.
The new proposal has sparked strong public opposition.
CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit with the city but later withdrew, avoiding the required public hearings. In turn, the Leavenworth City Commission unanimously passed a resolution requiring the company to complete the full permit process and has since filed a federal lawsuit.
In Newark, New Jersey, tensions have escalated between city officials and GEO Group over the company’s efforts to open the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall. The Newark mayor’s administration filed a legal complaint last week, accusing the company of violating local codes in a rush to complete the project.
The filing came just one day after Newark’s engineering department issued a stop-work order, halting all ongoing construction at the site. GEO plans to open the facility by this summer.
Trump’s mass deportation plan could rely on state cooperation

In late February, CoreCivic also announced that it has expanded its contracts with ICE to accommodate up to 784 detainees collectively at CoreCivic-owned facilities in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio and Oklahoma.
While some communities have pushed back against reopening detention centers over concerns about abuse and lack of oversight, others view the facilities as economic lifelines and say they offer a safer alternative than releasing detainees while their case is resolved.
Kansas state Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican who represents the Leavenworth area, told local TV station KCTV that he was initially against the Leavenworth Detention Center becoming an ICE detention facility, but later changed his mind.
“I was very concerned they may be released,” Proctor said. “They are ICE detainees that are being held until they can be put on a bus to be put on a plane to go back to their country of origin. … I think it’s much safer for the community.”
But some academic research has found that the economic benefits of private prisons are often overstated. In many private detention facilities, basic operations such as food service and janitorial work are carried out by detained immigrants, who are paid as little as $1 a day.
Troubling conditions
Unlike state-run prisons or local jails in states with oversight bodies, privately operated ICE detention centers are not subject to state inspections or regulations. States or local governments may have limited discretion to inspect or regulate when detainees are held in state-owned or local facilities, experts say, but even then, the extent of that oversight varies widely.
As a practical matter, experts say, there is little to no state or local oversight of federal immigration detention operations.

State legislators should focus on gathering as much information as possible about past private contracts, including how facilities operated and the challenges they faced, said Ben Eikey, manager of state training and development at the Levin Center for Oversight and Democracy, a nonpartisan organization that promotes government transparency.
Doing so, he argued, would help lawmakers make more informed decisions about how private detention centers and private prisons might affect their communities.
Internal audits and independent investigations have repeatedly flagged lapses in oversight at immigration detention centers, including those privately operated, across the country.
Although unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General found that ICE “generally complied” with detention standards, inspectors still uncovered troubling conditions and questionable practices at several facilities, according to a report released in September.
The report warned that these gaps undermine ICE’s “ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for staff and detainees.”
The report also highlighted concerns over “guaranteed minimums” built into some ICE contracts with private operators and state or local governments, which require the government to pay for a set number of beds regardless of whether they are filled.
Between 2020 and 2023, eight of the 17 inspected facilities cost the federal government roughly $160 million in payments for unused space, according to the report.
“Although ICE must acquire and maintain enough bed space to satisfy demand for population surges and must adjust for health and safety requirements,” Joseph Cuffari, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security wrote in the report, “it must also strive for balance to avoid wasting funds on empty beds.”

According to language from the House’s version of the budget, private colleges must automatically accept the top 10% of all high school graduates and comply with parts of Senate Bill 1 — Ohio’s massive new higher education law that is set to take effect in June and only applies to public universities and community colleges.

C. Todd Jones, president and general counsel of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio (AICUO), questioned the motive behind the bill.
“It’s clearly intended to have a bigger effect and push students to public colleges or out-of-state,” he said. “Our state needs a better workforce and there is simply no way that the public colleges alone have the capacity with the ability to attract all of the students who want to seek those degrees,” he said. 
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship gives the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to go to an Ohio college or university. It was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship.  
About 20% of the students who received the Governor’s Merit Scholarship attend a private Ohio college, Jones said. 
The Ohio House kept the funds for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship the same in the budget as Gov. Mike DeWine’s original proposal — $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million for fiscal year 2027, according to the House’s version of the budget. 
The House passed the budget Wednesday with a 60-39 vote and it now moves to the Ohio Senate. DeWine must sign the budget by June 30. 
Automatically absorbing the top 10% would be tough for private colleges since they don’t have branch campuses like most public universities in Ohio, Jones said. 
“Many of our colleges lack the ability to take this kind of a surge in a given year,” he said. “They don’t even have the capacity to have larger classes. They simply are physically unable to do this.”
The requirements for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship in the House’s version of the budget includes some of Senate Bill 1’s many provisions for private colleges including banning diversity efforts, creating post-tenure reviews, and requiring students to take an American history course, among other things. 
But some private colleges don’t have any tenured faculty or may only have a handful of tenured faculty, Jones said. 
“It is really about creating such burdens on private colleges, on nonprofit private colleges, that there would be no interest left in participating in the (Governor’s Merit Scholarship),” Jones said. “Why does Ohio — a state that has a desperate workforce need, that has a population problem where people are not moving here and our young people are moving away — why in the world are we quibbling for a few $1,000 to students that can get to stay here and provide for our workforce that leads to jobs?”

The proof-of-citizenship requirements trigger when voters register or update their existing registration. So, registered voters won’t notice any changes until they update information to reflect changes like a new name or address. If everything goes smoothly, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles will already have citizenship documentation on file. But if not, county boards of elections will start sending notices, and pretty soon prosecutors could get involved.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If a voter doesn’t respond to a pair of notices sent over the course of four weeks, the secretary of state must cancel their registration and refer the case to the attorney general. The same goes for voters who proactively cancel their registration after receiving the notice. Ditto if they vote provisionally and then fail to provide citizenship documents within four days of the election.
Similarly, if a county board receives a registration form from someone who’s ineligible — even in error — the board must refer the case to the county prosecutor.
In the name of security, the measure also eliminates ballot drop boxes and codifies an attestation form requirement for anyone dropping off another person’s ballot.
Sponsors’ case
State Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, told a committee, “It’s simple.”
“If you’re a citizen, you can provide proof of your citizenship, you can vote in our elections — it’s really that easy,” she said.
And in many cases verifying citizenship will be simple. But if the BMV doesn’t have the correct information — for instance, because of a name change through marriage or divorce — voters could be sent scrambling.
Noncitizen voting is very rare in Ohio and America. Not having proof of citizenship isn’t.

A University of Maryland study suggests more than 21 million Americans don’t have up-to-date citizenship documents on hand. Asked what documents would qualify, Gavarone herself stumbled and didn’t mention naturalization certificates. In the case of name changes, the bill requires an underlying proof of citizenship document as well as a marriage license or court order.
Her cosponsor, state Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, argued “ballot drop boxes are a major weakness in our elections, as they allow for anyone at any time, to tamper with ballots.” He pointed to a handful of ballot drop boxes firebombed in the Portland, Oregon area. In one case, hundreds of ballots were destroyed. In another, a fire suppression system saved all but three ballots.
But both sponsors overstate the threats they’re addressing while papering over the harms their legislation could cause. For example noncitizen voting is extremely rare, so it’s hard to see what problem the lawmakers were trying to fix with the proof-of-citizenship requirement.
Gavarone argued a recent Pew study showed “90% of Americans support a citizenship requirement to vote,” and lamented that “sadly, we have groups who think this isn’t necessary, or some who believe that we should allow noncitizens to vote.”
But that study didn’t ask about requiring proof of citizenship, and its results do more to undermine Gavarone’s allegation about some people wanting to allow noncitizens to vote. Far from pointing to support for noncitizen voting, Pew pollsters found 90% of respondents said it’s very or somewhat important to stop it from happening. Although Trump voters put more emphasis on the issue, 85% of those who supported Democratic candidate Kamala Harris said it was important to them.
Pressed to identify examples of damage to Ohio drop boxes, Brenner’s biggest complaint was people throwing trash in with ballots. But he warned that could spoil votes, too.
“The point is, if you put all your eggs in one basket,” Brenner said, “they have potential to be destroyed.”
Paid circulators
In addition to pushing back on proof of citizenship and drop box changes, Democrats on the committee seemed skeptical about a provision requiring a special badge for paid signature gatherers.
State Sen. Willis Blackshear, D-Dayton, asked if organizers should be punished because a canvasser lost a badge. State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, asked how they expect to police it for small-scale campaigns like liquor options.
Brenner acknowledged liquor issues might not ruffle feathers but argued “having that paid circulator notification a badge to show that you are one, I think that that can prove that, hey, this could be an outside group influencing peoples,’ you know maybe, ideas of what is being put on the ballot. And I think that is an important transparency factor.”

The House’s budget was approved by the chamber on Wednesday with only five Republicans voting against it.
It maintained some reductions to a children’s health initiative, and gave food banks across the state only “core funding,” without an increase that they say they need as the number of people asking for food continues to increase. And federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) often doesn’t cover the needs of Ohio residents.
The final House budget draft still includes SNAP work requirements and regulations, some of which were in Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget, and some were added by the House.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Children’s Hunger Alliance will still fight against cuts to its programs as the budget moves to the Senate. DeWine’s proposal asked for $3.75 million each year in federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds to be given to the alliance. The House reduced that amount to $2.5 million.
The cut could cause major problems for children in Ohio who need the help, according to the alliance. They include 2.8 million fewer meals and a doubling of the number of schools on a waitlist to join the program.
The hunger alliance’s president and CEO, Michelle Brown, said Columbiana and Athens counties would lose 150,000 meals in an Appalachian region that sees significant food insecurity already.
“We are urging the Senate to honor their commitment to children and by increasing CHA’s funding by $2.5 million over the biennium, to restore flat funding as proposed by the governor,” the alliance said in a statement after the House budget was passed.
The Hunger Network in Ohio criticized not only the hunger program cuts, but also cuts to the Fair School Funding Plan and the Housing Trust Fund. The network pressed the Senate to “adopt fiscally responsible investments to create a stronger Ohio that prioritizes Ohio neighbors who are struggling to make ends meet.”
The House-passed version of the bill didn’t include a provision of DeWine’s budget that would have provided free breakfast or lunch to school districts that participate in federal school meal programs and have a student population with at least 25% eligible for free or reduced-priced meals.
The measure removed from the budget by the House used the federal Community Eligibility Provision, something that also could be up for cuts on the federal end. The provision allows schools to participate based on the percentage of students in a school district who participate in other assistance programs like SNAP and TANF. Currently, schools are eligible if they have up to 40% participation in such programs.
Earlier this year, a congressional committee proposed changing the eligibility level for the provision. It would raise the participation percentage to 60%, a change that hunger relief advocates said could impact more than 280,000 Ohio children, and millions nationwide.
The House budget did retain DeWine’s language on the state’s school meal programs. It would reimburse districts to allow those eligible for reduced-priced meals to receive them for free. The previous state operating budget included $4 million for that purpose.
For the Ohio Association of Foodbanks, an earmark from TANF dollars of up to $24.5 million a year made it from the governor’s budget proposal to the House’s draft. The association is expected to use the money for food distribution, summer meal programs, SNAP outreach and even free tax filing services, according to budget documents. The provision also mentions “capacity building” equipment as part of the earmarked funding.
But the group still sees the need to fight for more on the Senate side, especially amid increasing demand and potential cuts to federal food assistance. The U.S. House passed a budget on Thursday, with funding cuts that could number in the trillions. They could include at least $880 billion in programs such as the SNAP program.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated at least $230 billion in federal cuts have been proposed through 2034 from the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, overseers the SNAP program, and reductions could come “largely or entirely” from SNAP.
Data from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services noted nearly 1.5 million SNAP recipients in the state as of last month.
The association’s executive director, Joree Novotny, said the group plans to ask the Senate to add $4.93 million per fiscal year to help offset rising food costs and allow the food banks to continue to source food locally.
“Since 2020, food prices have surged by nearly 24%, meaning the same level of funding buys significantly less, both in consumers’ grocery carts and in our own purchasing power as a statewide hunger relief network,” Novotny said in a statement. “…With modest additional support, Ohio’s foodbanks will continue to stretch every dollar to maintain access to healthy foods when seniors and working families are forced to turn to us for help.”

The commission is tasked with stopping anticompetitive business practices, especially those that harm consumers and small businesses. After making several statements that seemed supportive of its work, President Donald Trump’s recent actions seem to tell a different story. 
Trump in March attempted to remove commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, both of whom were appointed by Democrats. They both say Trump exceeded his powers and are suing to end the attempt. But their uncertain status has slowed or stymied the commission’s efforts against pharmacy middlemen and in other areas.
In a joint statement Thursday, Slaughter and Bedoya raised concerns that members of Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” had arrived at the FTC, looking to see whom to fire there. The commissioners worried that Musk’s people would access business secrets that the law requires be kept confidential.

“This threatens the basic functions of the FTC and the markets it protects,” Slaughter and Bedoya said in a written statement. “The FTC collects and retains extremely sensitive and confidential business data. This data can move markets. It can certainly change the competitive dynamics in any industry.”
Musk famously bought the social media platform known as Twitter and changed its name to X. The FTC has been examining such platforms’ practices, as well as those of other tech giants. So it likely has a storehouse of secret information regarding Musk’s companies and those of his competitors.
“Under no circumstances should DOGE be able to access this data,” Bedoya and Slaughter said. “We are deeply concerned that they may do it anyway. These are the legal requirements that the Chairman is bound to respect and the questions that he needs to answer to assure the public, and those the Commission regulates, that the extraordinarily sensitive data the FTC possesses is being safeguarded as required by law.”
Asked for comment, the office of FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson didn’t immediately respond Thursday. But the news organization Reuters quoted FTC spokesman Joe Simonson as saying Ferguson “supports the president’s agenda to cut out waste fraud and abuse in the federal government.”
Bedoya and Slaughter said allowing Musk’s subordinates access FTC files is rife with potential conflicts.
“We understand that DOGE representatives have been onboarded to the FTC as staffers of the Commission, rather than non-staff visitors,” the commissioners wrote. “While this may be an attempt to mitigate the risks posed by DOGE review of the FTC, those risks remain substantial, because they are coming from an arm of the executive branch not authorized by Congress and already known to be full of active market participants. Even if these DOGE-FTC employees focus primarily on contracts and vendor relationships rather than particular case files, they may still access substantial non-public data. For example, our contracts for expert witness testimony necessarily reveal information about ongoing, nonpublic law enforcement investigations.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) has joined another lawsuit against the federal government, this time taking on the U.S. Department of Education for its attempt to rescind previously approved pandemic-era relief funding for schools.
It’s just the latest in a series of lawsuits that Maryland has joined, or led, against Trump administraition efforts to slash federal jobs or programs.
Thursday’s suit, filed in New York with 15 other attorneys general and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), challenges the department’s “arbitrary and capricious” decision to cancel billions of dollars previously approved to the states last month.
The states claim that a March 28 letter from Education Secretary Linda McMahon announcing that a COVID-19 related program had ended at 5 p.m. that day, created “chaos for state education departments and local school districts.” A mass email was sent to all “chief state school officers” via email at 5:03 p.m.
Maryland and other states had asked for and received approval from the Biden administratiobn for an extension on how they drew down remaining pandemic-era funds. All the states, and the District of Columbia, which is also party to the suit, were given until March 2026 to spend the funds.
The money is being used for various educational programs and school construction projects, ranging from tutoring and reading materials to installation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.
However, McMahon’s letter dismissed all approvals given by the previous administration, saying it did not make sense for the department to be awarding COVID-19 grants “years after the COVID pandemic ended.” School districts should have known better than to count on the funds, she said.
Maryland education leaders said during an online March 31 news conference that the state stood to lose $418 million – $305.2 million that had already been spent but not reimbursed by the federal department, and another $112.8 million in “encumbered” funds not paid out by the state. That meant local school systems would have had to immediately stop any ongoing work on capital projects, or educational programs.
State Superintendent Carey Wright called the potential cuts “catastrophic” at the time, and that was echoed Thursday by the attorney general.
“The Trump Administration’s decision to cut this funding has thrown Maryland schools into turmoil and uncertainty and threatens valuable programs that help homeless and low-income students recover from the painful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Brown said in a statement. “This is a breathtakingly heartless action that threatens to change children’s futures for the worse, and our Office will not stand for it.”
Most of the money in Maryland comes from the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ARP ESSER, program. The suit highlights several affected projects such as Baltimore City Public Schools, which announced the cancellation of tutoring and after-school programs. The school system hasn’t been reimbursed $48 million.
A U.S. Department of Education spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Thursday night. But Madi Biedermann had said in a statement last month that “COVID is over. It is past time for the money to be returned to the people’s bank account.”
Thursday’s suit notes part of McMahon’s letter justifies the sudden change of position from the previous administration doesn’t fit with the current department’s “priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion.”
“The government had already declared the COVID-19 emergency over when ED [U.S. Education Department] issued approvals of the extension requests,” according to the suit. “Thus, the rationale ED uses to support its abrupt change in policy is nonsensical.”
With this lawsuit, the coalition is seeking a preliminary and permanent court order to prevent the derpartment from arbitrarily changing its position so the states can continue to access these essential funds.
As for Brown, the first lawsuit he joined against the U.S. Department of Education came March 6 when the department abruptly suspended $600 million in grants that states use to train teachers and place them in hard-to-staff schools.
On that same day, a federal workers lawsuit led by Brown was filed in U.S. District Court of Maryland that alleges the firings of tens of thousands of employees, including military veterans, were “unlawful.”
Exactly one week later, Brown announced he joined nearly two dozen attorneys general to sue the Trump administration from “dismantling the Department of Education” by reducing half of its workforce.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb10_anthonybrown2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 05:02:06.044145

If there is one American elected official who you’d think would make disease prevention among their highest priorities, it would be President Donald Trump. Just five years ago, Trump’s dreadful response to COVID-19 helped unleash one of the nation’s worst public health crises.
Tragically, however, by all indications, he hasn’t learned a thing. Instead, he’s appointed charlatans to head important public health agencies while also slashing their funding — thereby putting millions at unnecessary risk.
As NC Newsline reported this week, officials across the country fighting a historic measles outbreak have found themselves repeatedly undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation.
Here in North Carolina, state health officials report that Trump cuts have resulted in the loss of key staff whose job is to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats like measles.
The bottom line: Just like five years ago, many Americans will die this year because of Trump’s dreadful public health policy choices. Surely our nation can do better.

Welcome to Ohio Utility Watch, a newsletter tracking Ohio’s ongoing public-corruption saga, often referred to as the House Bill 6 or HB 6 scandal. If you’re new to the story, it revolves around the use of dark money by utility companies and others to pass roughly $60 million in bribes to secure more than $1.5 billion in ratepayer subsidies for aging, uneconomical coal and nuclear power plants.
Here are some developments from the last few weeks:


The state’s consumer advocate wants regulators to reduce FirstEnergy’s rate of return to reflect poor management practices that enabled bribes and corruption.


Environmental advocates say FirstEnergy’s ratemaking case should consider grid disparities in disadvantaged communities.


Legislation that would remove HB 6’s coal plant subsidies is moving full-speed ahead, along with incentives for more in-state power plants.


At a March 13 hearing, former FirstEnergy executives again declined to answer questions, citing their Fifth Amendment rights.








 Should ​‘abysmal’ management mean less profit from ratepayers?

Ohio’s state consumer advocate and others say FirstEnergy should be penalized with a lower rate of return in its rate case due to the company’s ​“egregious violation of laws and norms” in connection with the HB 6 scandal.
The Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel filed testimony on March 24 arguing, among other things, that the Public Utilities Commission should cut the company’s requested rate of return on capital investments by at least half a percent. All told, the consumers’ counsel says Ohio customers should pay FirstEnergy roughly $132 million less for annual distribution charges.
FirstEnergy responded on March 31, arguing the corruption scandal has no bearing on its first ratemaking case since 2007. Although the company expected five years ago that it would need to reduce rates when a new ratemaking process began, it now wants $183 million more per year from Ohio ratepayers.
The company has proposed that it earn a 10.8% rate of return on equity. That income generally functions as a reward to the firm for capital investments. An auditor hired by the commission suggested 9.63% based on its market analysis.
Ashley Brown, a former PUCO commissioner and past executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, said the company’s ​“abysmal” management should be a factor, regardless of whether it’s also addressed in other regulatory cases.
“I’ve never seen a better case for arguing performance should play a huge role in determining the rate of return,” Brown said.

 Should equity affect rates?

Ohio environmental advocates say FirstEnergy’s ratemaking case needs to address grid disparities for disadvantaged communities compared to elsewhere in the company’s service area.
The Ohio Environmental Council filed testimony last month criticizing the utility’s efforts to maintain and improve infrastructure for lower-income areas. The environmental group’s filings include testimony by Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.
“When utilities are requesting a return on investment, I think it’s prudent for customers to know why those investments are being made and to make sure those investments are being made in an equitable way,” Banton told Canary Media.
FirstEnergy’s March 31 response argued that its ratemaking case is unrelated to the equity issues raised by the Ohio Environmental Council. However, company testimony filed on March 24 talks about various investments to maintain and improve reliability.

 Energy bills move ahead

Both houses of the General Assembly have passed bills to end HB 6’s coal subsidies. Customers have paid roughly $460 million for two 1950s-era coal plants since the law’s subsidy mandate began in January 2020, according to the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel. The consumers’ counsel also estimates the plants have emitted almost 60 million tons of carbon dioxide, plus other pollutants, since then.
Ohio utilities oppose the bills, especially after lawmakers dropped language that would have let some charges continue as late as 2028. AEP Ohio ​“will continue to advocate for a reasonable timeline for transitioning the cost recovery,” along with other changes, said spokesperson Scott Blake.
More broadly, the bills aim to attract new in-state electricity generation, primarily through tax incentives and regulatory changes. The Ohio House and Senate are now considering versions of each other’s bills. Changes are likely before either becomes law.

 Witnesses still aren’t talking

Former FirstEnergy lobbyists and executives again asserted their Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions under oath about issues related to HB 6 during a March 13 hearing at the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
Administrative Law Judges Megan Addison and Jacky Werman St. John told lawyers for the Ohio Attorney General to secure a court order for Joel Bailey, Ty Pine, Dennis Chack, and Justin Biltz to answer questions in subsequent depositions, for which Ohio law would grant them immunity from criminal prosecution.
The PUCO first directed the Ohio Attorney General to get judicial orders compelling the testimony in early December. What’s different now is the witnesses’ lawyers appear inclined to accept a court order and grant of immunity within boundaries to be outlined in that order. The terms are not yet known.
Meanwhile, an evidentiary hearing for three of the HB 6–related regulatory cases is scheduled to start on May 13. One case deals with corporate separation issues that were split off from another evidentiary hearing last year. The other two cases involve riders, including one that was ultimately found unlawful but for which customers paid roughly $450,000.
In a separate proceeding, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel and Northwest Ohio Aggregation Coalition have appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court PUCO’s decision to let FirstEnergy revert to a package of added bill charges while its new ​“electric security plan” case makes its way through the commission.

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)Do you believe that private citizens, rather than the overreaching, intrusive federal government, should be the safety net for fellow Kansans?
Do you think that our best museums should operate not with the aid of taxpayer money, but instead from the revenue created by large private donations?
Do you think that ambitious science should be funded through millions of small donations from everyday Americans who will rationally donate each year?
Do you worry that the federal government will create socialized medicine by being involved — at all — in American health care?
“Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes,” a conservative MAGA voter with a worldview might answer. “A lean and unsympathetic federal government is the best kind of federal government. Washington should focus on national defense plus a small handful of vital services. Slashing the welfare state and silly federal grants is long overdue, whether you live in Burlington, Vermont, or Burlington, Kansas. We private citizens will support our local folks in need. We are charitable, so get the government out of the way!”
If this is your thinking, then this is your moment. Unfortunately. 
Following the cuts in federal funding triggered by the Trump administration, this is your moment to live up to your politics. Because you, dear conservative Kansan, are obliged to rescue your dear neighbor. It’s time to open your checkbook and start donating.
State and local journalists have documented many times over the past few weeks how the federal funding cuts have plunged local support systems into crisis.
The Kansas News Service explained how Kansans would struggle to enroll in Medicaid and marketplace insurance plans after the cancellation of federal funding. The number of uninsured Kansans will likely grow. Other Kansans may become susceptible to fraud.
The Beacon detailed how the cancellation of $12 billion in federal grants to states would jeopardize “public health basics like vaccines for children, infectious disease tracking, community health work and funding for mental health and addiction treatment.”
Another federal cut will force child-care providers to restart paying fees, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. A federal program vanished that temporarily saved providers the expense.
“The decision by the Trump administration to defund this initiative means that we have no choice but to reinstate the child care licensing and background check fees effective immediately,” wrote Janet Stanek, the secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, in an April 3 letter.
One of the leading tourist attractions in the Kansas City metro area, the National World War I Museum and Memorial, must pause a project while funds are in limbo. One of the more popular features of the museum’s website — digitized records from the war — might remain unfinished due to cuts, KCTV reports.
Fox 4 reported how cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture will affect food banks throughout the country, including Harvesters, which serves 17 counties in Kansas.
A different food and agriculture nonprofit is suing the Trump administration. Cultivate KC, which serves both Missouri and Kansas residents, had funds frozen for two conservation grants.
“We’re really hoping that it doesn’t get to the point where we see food systems nonprofits suffering to the point where they have to close their doors,” Cultivate KC executive director Brien Darby told KCUR.
This flurry of local journalism suggests that these specific stories are the tip of an iceberg, the size and shape of which is becoming clear as it rises to the surface. We should wonder what other local projects are capsizing and what nonprofits are rocking in the waves surrounding the metaphorical federal iceberg. 
Conveniently for Trump voters, museums and nonprofits will be easy to reach with donations. So, they can do that today. 
But what about the child care providers? And the federal workers who enrolled folks in insurance? And the Haskell University employees who temporarily lost their jobs? Will your supposedly robust desire to donate be generous enough to reach each of them?   
Of course, Kansas conservatives will never backfill the funds that were cruelly and thoughtlessly excised from vital agencies and nonprofits by federal cuts. For most Trump loyalists, their generosity was more ideological and rhetorical than practical and likely. 
Instead, these funding cuts will persuade Kansans like me, who did not vote for Trump’s slash-and-burn approach, to step up our contributions. If we can, we should. These are vital services for Kansans who need help.
Looking ahead (but not to minimize the damage that MAGA politics have done to Kansas already), there are likely greater and more numerous crises in store for regional nonprofits.
Many economists put the likelihood of a recession near 50% following the financial gridlock and commercial confusion of Trump’s tariffs last week. While we might focus on nationwide indicators like the stock market indices, consumer confidence and retirement plans, every economic downturn forces tens of thousands of people to seek support. In this way, the tariffs will punish working Kansans and send them scrambling.
“The speed and chaos surrounding President Trump’s policy rollout have created extraordinary global economic disruption; nobody alive has ever witnessed self-induced volatility on this scale,” wrote Ian Bremmer, the founder of the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, according to the New York Times.
Cancelled orders from abroad may soon leave workers unemployed in small Kansas towns. Frozen shipments from China may mean a fledgling heartland startup goes belly up.
All of this, while Trump’s 2017 tax cuts might not just be extended, but become permanent, if Republican plans succeed. Seeking fiscal restraint, fellow Republicans are demanding deep spending cuts — perhaps to more social services.
The passage of such legislation would be a grim pile-up: austerity on top of recession on top of austerity.
How will Kansans support fellow Kansans in such an atmosphere?
Our charitable nonprofits and federal safety nets — so recently hobbled — will be both vital and threadbare. We should work now to repair and embolden them, before their shelves and accounts are empty.
The politics of the moment point to us, whether MAGA, moderate or liberal. Urgent donations to nonprofits is the logical next step, regardless of ideology or voting record.

Steven Horsford asked U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer Wednesday. (House Ways and Means Committee screengrab)

Did you hear the one about everybody worldwide, probably even the penguins on those islands, telling Trump they would do whatever Trump says because he’s the greatest tariff negotiator in the whole history of ever?
Nevada Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford heard it, while he was in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday in which Trump’s U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, was testifying.
And Horsford wasn’t buying it.
Asked by Horsford for details on Trump’s “pause” on the trade war against pretty much the entire world that Trump launched with much fanfare last week, Greer said “my understanding is that because so many countries decided not to retaliate…”
“Excuse me?” interjected an incredulous Horsford.
“China increased their tariffs on the United States. Trump blinked,” Horsford told Greer
Horsford could have added that the European Union Wednesday approved 25% tariffs on a host of U.S. goods aimed primarily at Republican states — not in response to Trump’s preposterously named “reciprocal” tariffs he announced on the also preposterously named “Liberation Day” last week, but in retaliation for 25% tariffs Trump slapped on EU steel and aluminum last month. (Thursday the EU announced it would pause implementation of those tariffs to see if the 78-year-old toddler gets a clue while in his self-imposed time out over the next 90 days, although the EU phrased it more diplomatically.)
Horsford might also have reminded Greer that rather than trembling in terror at Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, the EU had been crafting retaliatory tariffs to those, too, through joint consultation between not only member nations but also potentially affected industries, in a methodical and thoughtful process of the sort unthinkable under the Trump-Musk freak show.
And Hosford could have even noted that Canada Wednesday announced 25% tariffs on U.S. autos and parts exports, matching Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada autos and parts that went into effect last week.
Who’s reciprocal now?
While Horsford was pressing Greer for details on what Trump’s tariff policy is now and how and when the determination to pause the big beautiful tariffs Trump announced last week was made, it became obvious that Greer — Trump’s top trade negotiator — only learned about it when a staffer whispered it into his ear during the Ways and Means hearing.
“WTF? Who’s in charge?” Horsford exclaimed, adding that Trump had “pulled the rug out from under” Greer and Horsford would feel sorry for him, except he doesn’t.
“There’s no strategy. You just found out, three seconds ago, sitting here. We saw you,” Horsford added.
“What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy?” Horsford continued. “How are you in charge of negotiations if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?”
At one point Wednesday Horsford referred to Trump administration tariff policy as “amateur hour.” He’s right. Trump’s tariff policy isn’t the product of some brilliant and carefully calibrated strategy. It’s dictated by Trump’s erratic temperament and crackpot obsessions.
But that’s no reason to ignore Trump’s venal side. And Horsford didn’t.
Before Trump tweeted his tariff policy, he took to social media to tell everyone “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!”
When he posted that, did Trump already know that within hours he would make an announcement that was sure to prompt the markets to rebound, and the social media post was a signal for those in the know? Did Trump by some other means tip off people prior to his announcement, thus allowing them to score a substantial financial windfall yesterday?
Or as Horsford put it to Greer, “Is this market manipulation?”
“No,” Greer responded.
“Why not?” Horsford asked. “If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?”
“It’s not market manipulation,” Greer responded.
“So if it’s not market manipulation, what is it?” Horsford asked again. “Who’s benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?”
Whatever else it was, “it sure is not a strategy,” Horsford added.
It’s hard to imagine some billionaire or three didn’t make a killing yesterday because Trump, wittingly or not, spilled the beans early. Trump and his courtiers are nothing if not messy.
Alas, even if Wednesday was a day of historic-folkloric insider trading, Oval Office style, the U.S. Supreme Court has decreed that laws are for mere mortals, not Trump.
Meanwhile, Trump wants everyone to believe he perfectly executed his “Liberation Day” tariffs and the world surrendered to his invincible Trumpness, and it was all part of his brilliant plan.
But Horsford’s right. Trump didn’t “pause” his tariffs because the world bowed down before him. Faced with markets crumbling because of him, nations standing up to him, and even some congressional Republicans publicly (gasp!) questioning his greatness, Trump lost his nerve, and blinked.
By the time the markets opened Thursday morning, Wednesday’s rebound, which fell far short of recouping losses since Trump’s Rose Garden “reciprocal” tariff tantrum last week, was already in quick retreat.
And whether it’s in 90 days, or 30 days, or every ten days, Trump’s aforementioned erratic temperament, combined with Republican congressional cowardice, guarantees a lot more episodes just as nerve-wracking and destructive as the fiasco Trump foisted on us with his asinine “Liberation Day.”

This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first here.
For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.
In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
 Ground zero: Virginia

Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
 ‘You get good and bad’

For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.










We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

Frustrated by slowing mail delivery, particularly in rural areas, the Kansas legislature in 2017 passed a law to let elections officials count mail ballots that arrived after Election Day, for up to three extra days, so long as the ballots were postmarked before polls closed. Kansas politicos joined other states with such a policy in calling this a “grace period.”
“Because that’s exactly what it was,” Jamie Shew, the clerk and top elections official in Douglas County, home to the city of Lawrence, told Bolts last week. “It was providing some grace for someone who did what they were supposed to do. We wanted to make sure those ballots counted.”
The reform drew zero committee testimony in opposition. Lawmakers voted 163-1 for it. Even Kansas’ then-secretary of state, Republican Kris Kobach, a longtime champion of voter restrictions who that same year helped run President Trump’s commission to investigate election fraud, wrote a letter of support: Kansans voting by mail need a little wiggle room, he told lawmakers, as a result of the U.S. Postal Service reducing processing sites in the state.
Voting, disability rights advocates claim Ohio photo voter ID law violates federal disabilities law

“There was universal acceptance because it just made sense,” said Shew, who helped draft the legislation and is now in his third decade as county clerk.
This was a popular line of thought around the country, and by the 2020 election nearly half of U.S. states—blue, red, and swing alike—had adopted their own grace-period laws.
Fast forward to this year: Republican politicians nationwide now can’t stand grace periods.
This past March alone brought news that two states—Kansas among them—will repeal their grace periods; that conservative federal judges are on the brink of killing grace periods in two other states; and that Trump, who for years has falsely alleged rampant mail-voting fraud, wants to pressure the rest of the nation to reject every mail ballot that arrives after polls close.
In Kansas, the Republicans who control the statehouse passed a bill this spring to end the grace period they’d created in 2017. In elections starting in 2026, any mail ballot received after 7 p.m. on Election Day will be tossed, even if it was postmarked in time.
Governor Laura Kelly, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, but Republicans had enough votes to override her. The bill, Kelly wrote in a veto letter, would “disenfranchise thousands of Kansas voters,” and constitutes “an attack” on rural voters because mail service is often slower for them than for people in cities.
Utah Republicans adopted a similar change just two weeks before Kansas, ending their state’s grace period amid a broad crackdown on mail voting. West Virginia is considering a bill to join them.
Trump singled out grace periods in his sweeping March 25 executive order on elections, ordering the Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” against states that allow them. He argued that these states are violating the federal statute requiring congressional elections to take place on the first Tuesday of November in even-numbered years. But that statute says nothing about dates for other elections, and, regardless, election law experts told Bolts the White House has no authority to command the rejection of ballots that arrive after Election Day. Trump’s order provided no detail on how he intends to do so.
National study shows Ohio suffers from health disparities, impacting voting ability

Election administrators around the country quickly denounced Trump’s attack on grace periods, and his order broadly, as a dramatic, unconstitutional overreach. Multiple groups, including a coalition of 19 state attorneys general, have already sued.
Trump, in his order, said of grace periods: “This is like allowing persons who arrive 3 days after Election Day, perhaps after a winner has been declared, to vote in person at a former voting precinct, which would be absurd.”
His analogy is logically unsound, because a ballot that arrives after Election Day in a state with a grace period is only counted if it was postmarked on or before Election Day, prior to the posting of any result. But Trump was echoing an increasingly popular line of thinking among U.S. conservatives: that someone who submits a ballot by mail hasn’t actually voted until that ballot arrives.
A panel on the Fifth Circuit, the arch-conservative federal appeals court that covers parts of the South, sided with the Republican National Committee last fall in its lawsuit against Mississippi’s grace period. “[Mississippi’s] problem is that it thinks a ballot can be ‘cast’ before it is received,” the ruling read, adding later that it should be “obvious that a ballot is ‘cast’ when the State takes custody of it.”
Rick Hasen, a professor at UCLA Law and election law expert, has called it a “bonkers opinion.”
“Requiring that people vote by election day is not the same as saying their ballots must be received by election day. Every other court to face these cases has rejected this argument,” Hasen wrote in Election Law Blog in October.
The Fifth Circuit last month declined to reconsider this ruling, leaving it in place pending a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The October ruling, rather than immediately banning Mississippi’s grace period, sent the matter back to a lower court; still, the state law is now at the mercy of an injunction by a federal judge.
The Fifth Circuit’s stance also threatens the status quo in Texas, the only other state within the circuit’s jurisdiction that allows a grace period for its mail ballots.
There is real potential impact to voters as judges and lawmakers tighten or eliminate grace periods: Already, plenty of states reject close to—or sometimes more than—1 percent of mail ballots for arriving after deadlines, and voting experts tell Bolts they expect that share to grow as more states end their grace periods.
States that send a mail ballot to every voter really do increase turnout, scholars find

Research shows that younger voters and non-white voters — populations that tend to favor Democrats — cast their ballots later on average than other groups. This explains why the count of ballots that have arrived after Election Day has historically often favored Democratic candidates, a so-called “blue shift” that has long fueled baseless conspiracy theorists in some corners of the right. “It just defies logic to me,” then-U.S. Speaker Paul Ryan said in the fall of 2018 about these Democratic gains.
Still, Republican politicians were mostly comfortable embracing mail voting until the 2020 presidential election, when Trump came to consistently attack the method as being rife with fraud. In the ensuing years, his allies have sought (successfully, in many cases) to curtail vote-by-mail, including by limiting drop boxes and making it more difficult for some voters to obtain mail ballots.
The blue lean of later-cast ballots adds to the fact that mail ballots overall lean generally in Democrats’ favor, a trend that holds true in Kansas: 11 percent of Democratic voters there voted by mail in 2024, compared to 6 percent of Republican voters, according to The Associated Press. Kansas’s soon-to-vanish grace period allowed roughly 2,100 voters to be counted last year, the AP reported.
Those voters accounted for only about 0.2 percent of total Kansas voters in the fall, but voting rights advocates argued that the relatively small percentage does not diminish the consequence of the grace-period ban. For one, they said, local elections in Kansas, as elsewhere, are sometimes decided by tiny margins that could be swayed by discounting late-arriving mail ballots.
Moreover, Mike Fonkert, deputy director of the organization Kansas Appleseed, told Bolts this week, “It’s a matter of principle. When legitimate voters cast legitimate votes, we should do everything in our power to collect those votes.”
Fonkert worries that mail delivery times are now increasing, which means that more people may be disenfranchised in the future. The Postal Service last month announced massive staff cuts as Trump signals a desire to take over and possibly privatize the agency, adding to the worry.
Shew, the Douglas County clerk, said that his office finds that it takes the Postal Service an average of 7-9 days to deliver mail ballots to Lawrence voters. Since he, like the rest of Kansas’ local elections officials, can only begin sending out ballots 20 days before elections, that kind of delay leaves voters who plan to submit ballots by mail with precious little time.
“We often joke we could walk to people’s houses faster than it gets there by mail,” Shew said. “So, if it takes seven days to arrive, now you’re down to 13 days. We have to tell people, ‘Do not spend a lot of time on your ballot, do not hold it.’ Because if it’s seven days to get there and seven to get back, that’s basically three days to vote.”
By eliminating its grace period, Kansas has reduced its mail-voting window from 23 days to 20—now tied with Iowa as the shortest such period in any U.S. state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Beyond their acute concerns over grace-period bans, voting rights advocates are wary of how these changes fit into broader restrictions on voter access. Barbara Smith-Warner, a former Democratic Oregon state lawmaker who promotes mail voting as the director of the National Vote-at-Home Institute, was one of several voting experts who told Bolts that grace periods are merely one battle in the GOP’s war to eliminate vote-by-mail altogether.
“You can cover it in nice language—We want to count the votes sooner, so they should be received sooner—but it’s a good way to kill two birds with one stone,” she said. “You weaken and decrease voting at home with mail ballots, and you lay the groundwork for going back to the fantasy, 1950s idea of everyone only voting on one day with paper ballots.”
This is no imagined threat; the Kansas lawmaker who sponsored the grace-period ban this spring has said he wants to end mail-voting, with only very narrow exceptions.
“If it was up to me, Election Day would be Election Day,” Republican Representative Pat Proctor, the repeal sponsor, said earlier this year, according to leaked video obtained by the Kansas advocacy group Loud Light and published by Kansas Reflector. “There wouldn’t be early voting. Mail-in ballots would only be for military or severely disabled.”
“But I got to bring 84 people with me,” he added, referencing the number needed to reach a veto-proof supermajority in the Kansas House, “so I’m trying to chip away at it.”
Proctor last week announced he is running in 2026 for Kansas secretary of state, a job that would hand him power to supervise elections and create certain statewide rules for their conduct.
Critics of Proctor’s anti-grace period legislation have stressed that it’s always taken several weeks after an election to count and certify all votes.
“Election Day has never been Election Day,” Shew said. “Anything we have on Tuesday is an unofficial vote. It’s never been that all the votes on Election Day represent all the votes.”
The ranking Democratic member on the elections committee Proctor chairs, state Representative Kirk Haskins, told Bolts he believes his Republican colleagues know this, but have larger aims in mind.
“No matter how you slice it, it’s about voter suppression,” he said. “They just want to create fear and to control who will vote. That seems to be the trend.”

(Stock photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)Nebraska’s lawmakers are hard at work in the state Legislature, debating how best to make Nebraska a great place to live, raise a family and do business.
One solution that could accomplish all those goals: finding lasting answers to our state’s child care crisis. Widespread access to affordable, quality child care would allow Nebraska’s economy to thrive, letting parents work and businesses grow, while nurturing children’s healthy development.
That’s why We Care for Kids hosted an educational event for policymakers last month, bringing together Nebraska state senators and staff for a conversation about the child care crisis. The event featured early childhood experts who shared research on child care gaps throughout the state and voter opinions on the crisis.
The takeaways: Nebraska needs more quality child care options, and voters want the state to help solve the crisis.
Demand outstrips supply
Currently, the gap between the potential need for child care and the actual capacity in the state is more than 17,000 spaces. Nebraskans realize that child care is an essential piece of our economic infrastructure. However, running a child care program is not currently a sustainable business model.
As an early childhood educator, I know this pain first-hand. And as a member of the We Care for Kids advisory group, I know I’m not alone. Child care is a labor-intensive industry, with labor costs making up 70-80% of a typical program’s operating costs.
Teachers currently earn an average of $14 per hour – not enough to meet basic housing, food, health care, and other needs. Those average hourly wages will go up due to Nebraska’s voter-mandated minimum wage increase, but many talented child care teachers are still choosing to leave the profession for jobs at Costco, Walmart and Hobby Lobby due to higher wages and perks.
The problem is that child care providers cannot charge families more. Child care already costs more than the average yearly cost of college tuition for most families.
As a result, child care programs struggle to stay open. Employers lose workers when parents must leave the workforce or turn down job opportunities due to a lack of access to child care in their communities. It’s a loss for families, a loss for educators, a loss for businesses, and a loss for Nebraska.
Solutions complex
The solution will have to come from many directions, including state policymakers.
In a survey conducted by We Care for Kids and Nebraska Extension last year, results show Nebraska voters want the Legislature to address the child care crisis with significant, long-term state investment. The survey found 84% of Nebraskans want the state to support child care and early learning like it does K-12 schools and higher education. This includes majorities across geography, gender, age and political party.
An earlier poll from the University of Nebraska and Nebraska Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources had similar findings, with the majority of those polled strongly agreeing that public resources should be invested to support the availability of child care in our communities.
For three years now, We Care for Kids has brought together more than 140 state and community organizations, businesses and municipalities to raise awareness about the importance of quality child care in our state. Nebraskans understand the importance. Now we want answers.
We know the future for all Nebraskans is closely tied with our ability to provide affordable, quality child care so that everyone can choose to participate in the economy.
Part of the solution will need to come from our representatives in the Legislature, part from community members and partnership efforts like We Care for Kids and part from Nebraska voters insisting this is a critical issue for our state. It will take all of us to help support the child care industry to make it a sustainable resource for Nebraska families and businesses.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers are considering removing all seven members of the State Library Board and allowing Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to replace them later this year.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, filed the bill Wednesday night, less than two hours after a House committee rejected Senate Bill 536, a proposal to abolish both the State Library and its board and transfer their powers and responsibilities to the Arkansas Department of Education.
Senate Bill 640 received initial committee approval Thursday morning and passed the full Senate in the afternoon. Bills usually are not heard by the full House or Senate until at least a day after passing committees, but the Senate suspended the rules Thursday to hear bills that had passed committee that morning.
The seven-member State Library Board disburses state funds to public libraries on a quarterly basis. It has appeared “fairly dysfunctional” at its recent meetings, so the Legislature should “wipe the board clean,” Dismang told the Senate Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs.
At a special meeting in March, the board rejected two motions with a 4-3 vote. They would have created nonbinding policies to protect children from “sexually explicit” content in libraries and detached the State Library from the American Library Association. By the same split vote, the board passed a separate motion aimed at protecting children in libraries while honoring the First Amendment and library material selection standards.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, filed SB 536 in response to the two failed motions, which he had asked the board to pass in order to ensure its survival. Sullivan has targeted the library board for its refusal to adopt policies directing public libraries to keep certain materials out of the hands of minors.
Arkansas senator continues mission to eliminate State Library Board, cites unfulfilled bargain

Dismang told the Advocate that Sullivan’s requests were “not extreme” and should not have been difficult for the board to accommodate, particularly the one regarding content accessible to minors.
“I don’t think anyone’s innocent in the way that those conversations are happening on that board,” he said. “…The tact both ways was not something that I was really impressed with, so starting over makes sense.”
The three board members who supported Sullivan’s requests were all Sanders appointees: former Republican state senator Jason Rapert, who moved to approve the requests; Shari Bales, whom the Senate confirmed alongside Rapert, and Sydney McKenzie, who joined the board in January and is married to Rogers Republican Rep. Brit McKenzie.
SB 640 would require the seven new members to draw lots determining how their terms will be staggered, ending between one and seven years from when the bill becomes law. Subsequent appointees would serve seven-year terms, the current length of time board members serve.
Sens. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, and Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, were the only Senate State Agencies committee members to oppose sending SB 640 to the Senate floor Thursday. Both voted against SB 536 on the floor last week, when the Senate passed the bill with 18 votes, the slimmest possible margin. 
King, Democratic Sen. Reginald Murdock of Marianna and GOP Sen. Ron Caldwell of Wynne did not vote on SB 640 Thursday afternoon. The Senate’s 27 other Republicans voted for SB 640. The remaining five Senate Democrats, including Tucker, voted against the bill, though Sen. Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was erroneously recorded as voting in favor.
Tucker told the Senate last week that the Legislature has the authority to reconstitute the State Library Board instead of dissolving it if lawmakers are dissatisfied with it. He said Thursday in an interview that SB 640 “is the least harmful version of anything that we can do,” but he opposed the bill because he didn’t believe reconstituting the board was necessary.
The House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs, the same panel that rejected SB 536, will be next to hear SB 640.

 Board members’ responses

All six Senate Democrats and four Republicans, including King, voted against confirming Rapert to the State Library Board in December 2023. King and Tucker expressed concern during Thursday’s committee meeting that Rapert might be reappointed if SB 640 becomes law. The bill does not preclude current members from reappointment.
When asked via email Thursday whether he would seek reappointment, Rapert said his appointment to the board was Sanders’ choice, not his, and he believes he has “done the job” expected of him.
“I fight for what is right and will continue to do so in all arenas of government,” said Rapert, founder of the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, a conservative group responsible for model legislation introduced in several statehouses nationwide, including bans on abortion and gender-affirming medical care.
During his tenure on the board, Rapert has repeatedly sought to withhold state funds from libraries where “sexually explicit” content is within children’s reach. The board has consistently voted against this proposal, and Rapert has called for the dissolution of the board.
He said he would have been satisfied with SB 536 becoming law but believed the passage of SB 640 would still be “a blessing.”
“My hope is that new members on the board will allow for policies to be adopted to encourage our public libraries to ensure that children are protected from exposure to sexually explicit materials inappropriate for their age,” Rapert said. “That has been my goal since day one… We would not be at this point if the members of that board had listened and taken positive action.”
The State Library Board is scheduled to meet the second Friday in May and in August. If SB 640 becomes law, it will go into effect Aug. 1, and it gives Sanders 30 days to replace the board.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Board Chairwoman Deborah Knox said in an interview that she was “encouraged” that the State Library is no longer likely to be abolished but “discouraged” that she might lose her position.
The board will be more likely to endorse Rapert’s efforts to detach from the American Library Association and to “sequester books” based on appropriateness for minors if all seven members are Sanders appointees, Knox said.
“I do feel that the State Library Board is essential and the Arkansas State Library itself is essential,” Knox said. “So any way that it can continue, I’m for [that] even if I’m not a part of it.”
Earlier this year, Sullivan sponsored Senate Bill 184, which would have abolished both the State Library Board and the Arkansas Educational Television Commission, the panel that oversees Arkansas PBS. He and the commission chair said in March that they had reached an agreement that kept the PBS commission alive; Sanders appointed Sullivan’s wife to the panel last year.
 More concerns

SB 536 would have codified several new criteria for libraries to receive state funds, including minimum hours of operation per year and “prohibit[ing] access to age-inappropriate materials to a person who is sixteen (16) years old or younger.”
Dismang was one of three senators to vote present on SB 536. He told the Advocate Thursday that despite his concerns about the current board, he believed the State Library should continue to exist, partly because it oversees historical records that SB 536 would have transferred to the Department of Education.
  Rep. Howard Beaty, Jr., R-Crossett
SB 640’s House sponsor, Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, was among the bipartisan opposition to SB 536 during Wednesday’s committee meeting. He said the conflict surrounding the State Library Board “could have been resolved very easily” if people on both sides had not “dug their heels in and decided they weren’t going to negotiate.”
Sullivan amended SB 536 Wednesday, meaning it would have had to receive Senate approval again before going to Sanders’ desk. The Legislature will not meet Friday and plans to conclude the session next Wednesday, making it difficult for SB 536 to complete the legislative process if House State Agencies were to reconsider and pass the bill.
The amendment to SB 536 removed a requirement for libraries’ collections not to have any materials that state law considers “harmful to minors” in order to receive state funding. Sullivan said he amended the bill “at the request of librarians and community members.”
One of those community members was Victoria Kelley of Yellville, she told the Advocate Thursday. She said SB 640 concerned her because she disagreed with dismissing “entire boards without justifying the ‘cause’ for what individuals did wrong,” which continues “a bad precedent” that began in her home of Marion County.
In December, County Judge Jason Stumph and the county Quorum Court dismissed the local library’s existing board members and later replaced them all in January. Stumph said the previous board failed to supervise Dana Scott, the director of the Yellville library who was dismissed and arrested Dec. 2 for alleged financial crimes.
Marion County officials appoint new library board, accept interim library manager’s resignation

Staggered terms on the State Library Board are “meant as a buffer to the kind of personal and partisan targeting we’re seeing” so that one governor cannot “overhaul” the body, Kelley said.
Kristin Stuart of Little Rock told the Advocate she had similar frustrations. She sought to speak against SB 640 during Thursday’s State Agencies committee meeting, but chairman Sen. Scott Flippo, R-Bull Shoals, denied her the opportunity because she had not signed up in advance.
“I think it’s really just insane that they want to dismantle the board after the outright abolition [bill] failed,” Stuart said. “It’s a power grab. It’s an attempt to politicize a body that’s operated independently for decades without partisan interference.”
Two good things about SB 640, Kelley said, are that the State Library will continue to exist and that new members will not make it easier for the board to “upend the Constitution.”
SB 536 had similarly “fatal” language as Act 372 of 2023, Arkansas Library Association (ArLA) President-elect Adam Webb said Wednesday. A federal judge blocked portions of the Sullivan-sponsored law last year on First Amendment grounds, and the state is appealing the ruling.
The ArLA is neutral on SB 640, Webb said Thursday.
The blocked sections of Act 372 would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials. Webb and ArLA are among 18 plaintiffs that challenged the law.

,California,2025-04-11 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Wide school disparities persist 54 years after California’s landmark  funding decision,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/school-disparities-california-funding/,"Several decades of fighting over how to ""equalize"" education funding have landed California back where it started, with an inequitable, taxpayer-funded public education system that can't close achievement gaps.","In 1971 California’s Supreme Court issued one of its most important and far-reaching decisions, declaring that the state’s system of financing public schools — primarily via locally levied property taxes — was unconstitutionally unfair.
It ruled that because there were huge disparities in the amount of taxable property per-student, there were also “substantial disparities in expenditures per pupil among school districts,” which “perpetuate substantial disparities in the quality and extent of availability of educational opportunities. For this reason the school financing system before the court fails to provide equality of treatment to all the pupils in the state.”
The decision ignited decades of political debate, particularly in the Legislature, over “equalization” — bringing per pupil spending into rough equity. Four years after that decision Republican legislators even held up passage of the state budget, demanding more school money for their suburban districts, which relied on taxing houses, to offset the greater ability of urban schools to raise money because they could tax commercial and industrial property.
The equalization conflict has been punctuated by two landmark ballot measures. In 1978 Proposition 13, which sharply limited property taxes, had the indirect effect of shifting the basic financing of schools to the state. Proposition 98, enacted a decade later, aimed at guaranteeing schools a permanent share, roughly 40%, of the state’s general fund revenues.
Another milestone occurred in 2013, when then-Gov. Jerry Brown persuaded the Legislature to enact the Local Control Funding Formula, which re-interpreted equalization to give schools with large numbers of poor and English-learner students additional funds to close what was called the “achievement gap.”
A new wrinkle in the perpetual equalization debate popped up this year. Senate Bill 743, carried by state Sen. Dave Cortese, a San Jose Democrat, is aimed at offsetting the ability of school districts in high-wealth communities to generate so much property tax money that they qualify for only token amounts of state aid.
These 139 “basic aid districts” can raise large amounts of property taxes because the Legislature decided, after the passage of Proposition 13, to freeze existing shares of each county’s property tax pool.
Cortese deems that an “antiquated 1978 funding formula that has created winners and losers in the public education system for the last 45 years” and says his measure is “about equalization and reversing the consequences of past mistakes.”
His bill would create an state education endowment fund that would provide extra money to non-basic aid districts. It cleared the Senate Education Committee this week.
While Cortese’s measure could narrow remaining gaps in per-pupil spending, there still would be wide disparities simply because property taxes remain a major factor in school financing, despite the overall limits imposed by Proposition 13. And communities vary widely in their taxable property values.
In other words, what the state Supreme Court declared to be constitutionally unacceptable in 1971 still exists in 2025.

Commentary 
The real crisis in California schools is low achievement, not cultural conflicts 

by Dan Walters 





Complete equalization would probably require eliminating property tax allocations to schools, substituting 100% financing from the state budget, or, as the court hinted, the state levying property taxes for schools and then allocating those proceeds equally.
Either would be a major political undertaking, because changes in school finance inevitably create winners and losers. Meanwhile equalizing per-pupil financing has undergone revision because the needs of students vary so widely.
Brown’s Local Control Funding Formula is one expression of that revision, declaring that some kids need more educational attention than others if the achievement gap is to be closed, and that means more financial support as well.
However, over the past 12 years, Brown’s step away from strict equalization has not, at least so far, appreciably narrowed the stubborn gap.

Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, asks a question during a meeting of the Arkansas Senate on April 10, 2025. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)After five failed votes, a $750 million prison appropriation bill appears dead for the legislative session, and state lawmakers are considering other methods for securing the needed funding to build the 3,000-bed facility in Franklin County.
The project has been controversial since it was announced in October, due to concerns over transparency, cost, infrastructure and an available workforce. Supporters of building the new state prison, including Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have said it’s necessary to address overcrowding in county jails. 
Searcy Republican and Senate Bill 354 sponsor Sen. Jonathan Dismang said Thursday afternoon that he didn’t see the point in continuing to vote because his legislation didn’t have the 27 votes needed to clear the Arkansas Senate. 
Bills typically need a simple majority to advance in the Legislature, but appropriation bills require a three-fourths majority, or 27 votes in the 35-member Senate. 
“We’re getting toward the end of the session, really today would have been the last day I think to try to clear it through the House,” Dismang said. “ I’m sure that we can jump through some procedural maneuvers if something changes over the weekend, but I don’t believe that we’ll be passing that appropriation.”
House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans, R-Cabot, told the Advocate early Thursday evening that he thinks the Senate can get 27 votes next week since some members’ questions have been answered. 
“I think they’re very close to the 27,” he said. “There might have been an issue that came up this morning where a couple of them just said ‘Hey can we get another question or two answered?’… I still feel confident that they’ll get those votes on Monday and so the bill will come down here Tuesday, and we’re very optimistic that we have the votes here to pass it.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Dismang said he expects “quite a bit of movement” over the summer on the estimated $825 million project because the Legislature set aside $75 million in 2022 that has already been appropriated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. 
Following the state’s purchase of 815 acres near Charleston last year for nearly $3 million, the corrections board has moved forward with the project by hiring a construction management company and seeking proposals from architectural firms and contractors. 
The Legislature also set aside another $330 million for the project that hasn’t been appropriated yet. State lawmakers have the ability to release some additional funding if needed, but Dismang said he doesn’t expect the Legislature will have to take more action until they return for the fiscal session next spring. 
Even if SB 354 was approved, Dismang said funding was always going to be released in stages, with the governor requesting various amounts by letter. The requests would require a three-fifths majority approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council, he said. 
The Saline Courier reported that Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, said he anticipated the governor would call a special session to secure the funding, but Dismang said Thursday that’s not the case.
Prison bill gains some traction in Arkansas Senate, but not enough to advance

“We’re not going to waste money on a special session,” he said. “We had our ability to do something here. A minority of members decided they did not want to, and so this is where we are.”
Failing to approve SB 354 will not be detrimental to the project, according to Dismang, who said the experience over the last few weeks was good for the executive branch and the legislative body. 
“We have members that had questions, but weren’t asking their questions to anyone. We had an executive branch that was not probably reaching out as fully as they should,” he said. “I think the last two weeks that’s improved greatly. You saw that with some movement of votes and probably would have had further movement if we’d called for another vote — just not 27.”
Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, initially voted against SB 354, but joined 20 of his colleagues in voting for the bill Tuesday after he said the executive branch addressed some of his concerns with the project, such as staffing. 
Green Forest Republican Sen. Bryan King, an outspoken critic of the project who seemed unlikely to be swayed, said Thursday he was pleased by the decision to halt voting on the appropriation bill.
“I am happy for the citizens of Arkansas and hope the Franklin County mega-prison scam is stopped before it gets past the point of no return,” King said in a text message. “Arkansas can do better by hiring more public safety officers to reduce crime and address overcrowding by building facilities in a more financially responsible way.”
No meetings are scheduled for Friday, but lawmakers will return to the Capitol Monday for the remaining days of the session, which is expected to end Wednesday.

John McCosh/Georgia Recorder Former Georgia Public Service Commission candidate Patty Durand has founded a utility watchdog that she envisions as providing a new way to hold state regulators and Georgia Power accountable.
Durand’s newly formed Georgia Utility Watch’s initial goal is to restore a consumer advocacy group similar to the state’s former Consumers Utility Counsel, which represented residential and small business owners in utility rate cases until it was disbanded during the state’s budget cuts in response to the financial crisis in 2008. 
Among Georgia Utility Watch’s goals is a prohibition against stipulated agreements between the PSC and Georgia Power until after the hearing process is completed and to ensure data centers do not pass on their energy costs to small businesses and residential customers. 
Durand launched Georgia Utility Watch last week while eight candidates qualified for the two Public Service Commission seats up for grabs later this year.
Georgia Utility Watch also plans to monitor a pair of major cases set to be settled by the five elected members of the state regulatory commission this year, which will affect Georgia Power ratepayers’ pocketbooks as well as determine the mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources the company will use to generate electricity for the next few years.
The PSC is scheduled to vote this year on Georgia Power’s long-term 2025 Integrated Resource Plan and a three-year electric rate case.
Durand often attends PSC meetings where she and a number of environmental and consumer groups have been critical of the commission signing off on Georgia Power expanding and extending its use of fossil fuels, as well as the six rate increases that saddled the average Georgia Power household paying about $43 more per month on utility bills since the start of 2020. 
Durand has also criticized the five sitting Republican members of the Public Service Commission for living in homes that are served by an Electric Membership Corporation while making decisions affecting Georgia Power’s 2.8 million customers.

During Durand’s professional career, she worked 10 years as the executive director of the Georgia-based Smart Energy Consumer Collaborative. She was a Democratic candidate in 2022 for the District 2 commission seat held by incumbent Tim Echols. Her election bid became one of several PSC races stalled because of litigation and state legislative redistricting.
Durand said she believes her role with Georgia Utility Watch will have a greater impact on utility regulation than she would making another run in a PSC election. 
“While Americans highly value market competition, Georgia operates with a stark contradiction: a state-sanctioned monopoly for Georgia Power,” Durand said. “This leaves customers captive, with no alternative utility provider. Compounding this issue, state representatives and Public Service Commissioners accept significant financial contributions from Georgia Power, its employees, contractors, and legal team. Consequently, decisions favor Georgia Power, who reaps enormous profits from selling a basic commodity while shielded from risk and competition. This system demands change.”
The PSC is set to vote in June on Georgia Power’s latest plan. Testimony last month from Georgia Power officials forecast how the state’s largest utility plans to spend billions of dollars to meet its skyrocketing energy demand, primarily due to the projected growth of large data centers supporting artificial intelligence.  
During the late March hearing, Georgia Power officials were pressed to explain why it wants to build four gas-burning units at Plant Bowen to support artificial intelligence growth when the company’s stated priority is to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.

It doesn’t have to weigh in on much of anything, actually","America was born in war, and we have been involved in quite a few of them over the years. A nation born of war will, of course, have a template for waging it. It is duly set forth in our founding document: we’re at war when Congress declares it. 
Not!
That there “Congress” thingy hasn’t declared a war since World War II, and since then we have invaded, overthrown and bombed the hell out of so many nations that I would be up against the word count limit to list them. Suffice it to say that the Vietnam “War” never was; It was a “police action”. Fifty thousand Americans got killed, but it wasn’t a war. Congress never declared it. 
 Since then, it has been a sort of open season. Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Panama– it’s not so much “Shoot first, ask questions later,” it’s more “Let’s just shoot.” There won’t be any particular questions because, hey, there wasn’t any war to begin with.
The rise of the undeclared war coincides with the rise of the use of the term “war” to refer to activities that do not involve firearms or weapons of any kind. It was during the 1960’s– while Lyndon Johnson was overseeing the carpet-bombing of Indochina- that we launched our “war on poverty.” Then there was the “war on drugs.” Not too long ago, Democrats spoke of the “war on women,” which consisted of little more than Republican opposition to abortion. 
It’s all a war now, right? Now that we are waging actual war all the time– deploying troops and weapons, killing people and blowing things up overseas so regularly that the public tunes it out– the word “war” is available. It has lost its actual meaning, but it’s so evocative! So powerful…
Now, these linguistic and governmental lapses have come home to roost. Trump says we are under attack, it’s an “invasion,” and that’s why he can use an ancient provision meant to apply to agents of nations making war on the U.S.– an actual worry in the early days– to deport people with tattoos. And who is to say he’s wrong?
If anybody wanted to say he’s wrong because we’re not at war until the Congress says we’re at war, their parents or grandparents should have made that point about 70 years ago. If anybody wanted to object to the loose use of the word “war” to describe any sort of opposition to anything, they are probably me. Or some other irrelevant voice in our national cacophony.      
These days we are, literally, at war all the time. If there’s a distinction between Biden and Trump it isn’t, for instance, who bombs the Houthis in Yemen. Biden did; Trump too. Trump might tell you that his bombs are bigger; that’s where we are.
It was a good plan, setting forth in our founding document a specific and exacting process by which our nation would commit to that most extreme act, war. Then again, in those days the Congress was a serious place where earnest citizens discussed weighty matters. 
Now, Marjorie Taylor-Greene heads a committee. Anymore, Congress doesn’t have to weigh in on war and peace. It doesn’t have to weigh in on much of anything, actually; Trump issues another executive order, and the courts object or don’t, and the Trump administration either obeys the court or it doesn’t. Congress is a channel on TV that you probably don’t watch much anymore.

Jane Garibay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/11/ct-biomarker-bill-could-help-save-lives/,"Biomarker testing is the key to precision medicine. It should not be a privilege for those who can afford it, but a standard of care.","Two years. That’s how long my sister-in-law Kathy fought an aggressive and devastating uterine cancer. Two years of grueling treatments, exhausting hospital stays, and painful moments of helplessness. Two years that could have been different – if only she had access to affordable biomarker testing.
Kathy was a mother first. When faced with the decision of whether to pay $2,500 for biomarker testing – a test that could have guided her toward a life-saving hysterectomy – she hesitated. Not because she didn’t want to know, but because, like so many caregivers, she put her child first. 
My 46-year-old niece, Jenny, has Down syndrome. Kathy worried about the cost, about the future, about everything except herself. In the end, she didn’t get the test. And she didn’t get the chance to make the choice that could have saved her life.
Tragically, my brother, Jenny’s father, also lost his life to cancer caused by Agent Orange exposure. That left Jenny in my care. As her aunt and now her guardian, I carry not just the weight of my grief, but the responsibility of ensuring she has the love, support, and security she needs. This could have been prevented. No family should have to endure this kind of loss when they have the means.
I am championing legislation that will make biomarker testing accessible for all who are in need. As the Chair of the Aging Committee, I am championing a bill with overwhelming bipartisan and bicameral support – over 62 co-sponsors from every party, every chamber, and every caucus in the General Assembly. This is not about politics; this is about saving lives.
Biomarker testing is the key to precision medicine. It helps doctors tailor treatments, avoid unnecessary procedures, and, most importantly, give patients and families a fighting chance. It should not be a privilege for those who can afford it, but a standard of care.
We have the opportunity to prevent stories like mine from happening to others. We have the chance to pass this bill and ensure that no family is forced to choose between financial stability and life-saving medical decisions.
Let’s do what’s right. Let’s pass this bill and give every Connecticut family the chance they deserve.

John Fonfara’s apparent unchecked appointment to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) should have people protesting in the street.,"As a Connecticut ratepayer, the ethical discussion around Sen. John Fonfara’s apparent unchecked appointment to the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) should have people protesting in the street. 
The newest federal administration has shown no opposition to appointing individuals with vested interests into powerful positions, ultimately benefiting their own profits over the citizens of this country. We cannot stand to let that precedent into Connecticut.

Mia Adduci
According to reports, one of PURA’s new appointments is slated to be filled by State Sen. John Fonfara, despite his history co-owning an electric firm with run-ins accruing measurable penalties from PURA. Wattafi (formerly Optik Energy) formally dissolved in 2023, but within his seven years in the electric industry, Fonfara’s firm managed to reach that $1 million mark in fees and late penalties against the agency.
Now, we are being forced to ask how a man whose company has accrued over $1 million in penalties from a state agency is now slated to serve as one of just five energy regulators under the commission.
The essence of PURA’s mission is accountability. But he refuses to take accountability himself,  dismissing Wattafi’s penalties  as “unjust” and “inappropriate?” If you are unable to see the justification in your own organization being held accountable, how are you to be trusted to justly hold others accountable for executing damaging penalties against state regulations?
To work for the agency that revoked the license of your defunct organization is disturbingly hypocritical, and leaves much room for concern about how Fonfara will perform in this role. How are Connecticut’s citizens to trust that his judgements are free of retaliatory bias?
Agencies in PURA’s sphere hold a privileged power over the state of our current climate crisis. To grant this privilege to someone who has no appreciation for its execution, minimizing the validity of its implementation upon oneself, is a foolish and damaging mistake.
Wattafi was penalized multiple years in a row for insufficiency in renewable energy measures (2018/2019).
In this position, Fonfara’s salary for up to six years could be paid solely by the penalties he owes to the agency, with commissioners making between $150,000 and $207,000 annually.
Fonfara’s appointment becomes even more curious once you begin to look at the broader proceedings of this term of PURA’s expansion.
The reappointment of Marissa Gillett, who has been chairman of PURA since 2019, notably rested on Fonfara’s swing vote this time around. In a rather convenient timeline, Fonfara’s vote in Gillett’s favor came after Gov. Ned Lamont’s  agreement to nominate him for the position in question. Would Gillett even be returning to her position if Fonfara was not slated to be on the commissioner board?
The changes seen to PURA also include a removal of the commission from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). Instead, PURA will transition to a “quasi-public agency,” reducing governmental influence over its activity and removing it from its direct ties to the executive branch.
Fonfara would have been constitutionally disqualified from the position if PURA remained a regular state agency. Why are we taking shortcuts to avoid constitutional violations, and give Fonfara not only a leg up in his power down at the capitol, but a massively disproportionate uptick in his salary when compared to his peers in both branches of government?
To sit back and watch a man who could not abide by the regulations he is tasked with upholding now sit on a board to set statewide utility rates  is nothing short of diabolical.
However, it seems the common people aren’t the only ones picking up on the red flags of the situation. S.B. 1531 currently sits on the table, and among many initiatives to prevent joint monopolization over gas and electric authority within the state, the bill is seeking to increase requirements for PURA members in attempts to reduce conflicts of interest present in regulators serving on the commission.
Now, we must ask how these sought-after “substantial conflict recusal requirements” will impact the Fonfara situation. Ultimately, we must also question how specific the intent of this bill is. Is it possible that the state is as averse to Fonfara’s placement as a regulator as we are?

Underly at a rally for 2025 Public Schools Week. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction is resisting the Trump administration’s threat that it certify that local school districts put an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs or lose federal funding.
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement about the response that Wisconsin schools need support, not threatened cuts to federal funding.
“We cannot stand by while the current administration threatens our schools with unnecessary and potentially unlawful mandates based on political beliefs,” Underly said. “Our responsibility is to ensure Wisconsin students receive the best education possible, and that means allowing schools to make local decisions based on what is best for their kids and their communities.”
The federal directive comes as a part of the Trump administration’s crack-down on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the country and in K-12 as well as higher education. 
Wisconsin joins several states, most led by Democrats, that are rejecting the demands from the federal government. 
In the letter sent to state agencies last week, the Department of Education told state education departments that they needed to certify their compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard — the landmark Supreme Court decision that found consideration of race in higher education admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement that the request includes ensuring that schools aren’t “using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI.” Trainor said the government has seen “too many schools flout or outright violate these obligations.” The federal agency gave state agencies 10 days to respond and warned that federal funding could be at risk if there was continued use of “illegal DEI.” 
In a response letter to the U.S. Department of Education, DPI said it has already provided the federal agency with compliance assurances required by federal law, including those related to nondiscrimination. It said that it was unclear why the federal agency is requesting another certification and noted that the agency itself had said that recent guidance “does not have the force and effect of law and does not bind the public or create new legal standards.” 
“At best, the [directive] appears to be redundant. At worst, the [directive] appears to be unauthorized, unlawful and unconstitutionally vague,” Wisconsin DPI General Counsel Benjamin Jones wrote in the letter. “We are deeply concerned that the [request] allows the federal bureaucracy to threaten the loss of crucial education funding in order to dictate local education agency policies and decisions on what is best for kids.” 
The state agency asked the federal agency to answer a series of questions before it complies with the request, including the specific purpose of the certification, whether the requested certification seeks to enforce any requirement beyond what is required by federal law and regulation and what legal authority the Education Department is using to make the request a condition of federal aid.
DPI said that while it waits for a response, it will not collect certifications from local education agencies and will not send the requested certification to the U.S. Department of Education.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of District 5 and State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of District 7, both elected in November, said they invite constituents to gather and discuss important issues and to share ideas.
“I just want to make sure South Omaha knows they have a voice, that we’re fighting for them,” said Guereca.
The two lawmakers said they want to hear what’s on the minds of residents and will touch on what they’re working on in the Legislature. 
For example, the bill Guereca has made his priority this session is Legislative Bill 224, which would require 12 weeks of paid maternity leave for eligible state employees.

Juarez’s priority legislation got complicated. At first, her priority was Legislative Bill 299, which in part sought to allow immigrants who have legal permission to work in the U.S. but lack permanent residency access to unemployment insurance benefits their employers pay into.
But that bill was crushed under the weight of a Trump administration threat that the state could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid.
Juarez said she now plans to prioritize a bill originally introduced by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, which codifies the Nebraska Promise Program, established by the University of Nebraska. Legislative Bill 417 further would create a similar program at community and state colleges, to provide tuition waivers for income-qualified Nebraska resident students.

But major changes made in the Senate on Thursday have set up a clash with their Democratic colleagues in the House as the legislative session heads into its final two weeks. 
Before passing House Bill 1217 on Thursday, Democrats in the state Senate amended it, raising the limit on rent increases to 10% plus inflation in a single year, with some exceptions. That’s up from the 7% cap the House approved last month. 
Landlords would also need to give written notice 90 days before increasing rent. And when a tenancy begins, they can set rent however they please. 
Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, proposed the amendment to raise the limit. The change prevailed by a single vote on the Senate floor in a dramatic roll call vote. Sen. John Lovick, D-Mill Creek, cast the deciding vote.
“A 7% cap, I think, is dangerous. I hope I’m wrong,” Shewmake said in floor debate. “I’m worried, at a time of turmoil and change, that we can see a lessening of supply, and that when people have to move for various reasons, because they got a job, or they moved out, or they moved in, they’re going to face a worse rental market.”
Lovick said he thought this was the “more fair” approach.
“You can’t hide from your votes down here, but it’s just what my conscience led me to vote on,” he said in an interview.
After her colleagues adopted the amendment, one of the legislation’s main supporters, Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma, said, “You see what happens when Democrats sell out.”
Another change approved Thursday, from Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, exempts single-family home rentals if they aren’t owned by a real estate development trust or company.
Sen. Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, an author of the bill, said she was surprised the amendments prevailed. 
“No matter what, this was a really important step,” she said after the vote. “Renters across the state are struggling. We can do something for them and we took one more step to getting this bill across the finish line.”
The final Senate vote Thursday was 29-20, with Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver, joining all Republicans in opposition.
The bill now goes back to the House to weigh in on the changes made in the Senate before it can reach the governor’s desk. 
Lovick’s seatmate, Rep. April Berg, D-Mill Creek, said the House “will try to bring it back to a fair and equitable policy for all renters.”
If signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson, the proposal would go into effect immediately.
This is the furthest the landmark legislation has gone in Washington. Last year, the bill, a top priority for progressive Democrats, lapsed in the Senate Ways & Means Committee after passing the House.
After the bill passed the House on a 53-42 vote in March, Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, indicated it would need changes in his chamber to win enough Democratic votes.
In the Senate this time around, committees added an expiration date for the residential rent cap. The limit would now sunset after 15 years.
They also lengthened the exemption from the cap for newly constructed buildings from 12 to 15 years. An analysis of its impacts after 10 years is also now required.
Supporters of the bill say it will give renters greater predictability and help tenants who may become homeless if faced with a sudden, steep rent hike.
“What a landlord does is they charge what the market can bear,” Alvarado said ahead of the vote. “But Washingtonians can’t bear it anymore. Hardworking people can’t afford working long days and long weeks just to see their wage increases get gobbled up by rent increases.”
Opponents, including many landlords and builders, argue the legislation — combined with a proposal to allow for annual state property tax increases above 1% — will price out small landlords who can’t keep up with inflationary costs. They also say it will drive developers to other states, hurting Washington’s supply of housing.
“We hear people saying we need affordable housing, and I just believe that we have to be serious about solving this problem without zeroing in on one solution and one solution that may actually exacerbate the situation,” said Sen. Keith Goehner, R-Dryden.
In their campaign to stop the bill, well-funded housing industry groups have targeted moderate Democratic senators in recent weeks. This advertising push has drawn concerns from the proposal’s supporters over what they see as a lack of transparency about who is funding the opposition effort.
House Bill 1217 does a number of other things beyond the rent increase cap.
Under the bill, for example, landlords also could not raise rent by any amount in the first 12 months of a tenancy. Tenants or the state attorney general’s office could bring litigation over violations of the proposed law.
But buildings owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities would be exempt from the limits. The same goes for duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes if the owner lives in one of the units.
The legislation also caps rent increases at 5% for manufactured home tenants.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Senate will vote as soon as Friday on legislation that seeks to permanently increase K-12 public school funding, but Gov. Mike Dunleavy has vowed to veto the bill if it passes as currently written.
On Thursday morning, the Senate Finance Committee approved a modified version of House Bill 69, which would increase the base student allocation — the core of the state’s per-student public school funding formula — by $1,000 per student.
School districts and public school advocates have testified for years that state funding, which has been kept flat amid rising inflation, is inadequate and has caused extensive cuts that hurt student performance.
The bill is a top priority for the multipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate.
If the new formula is fully funded by legislators and the governor, the effect would be an additional $253 million per year for public education.
The state House has already approved a version of the bill, meaning that if the Senate approves it, members of the House would be asked to approve the Senate’s version or send the bill to a conference committee to negotiate a compromise.
In a statement posted on social media, Dunleavy called the bill’s present form “a joke,” adding, “Unless it is amended to address needed policies, if this lands on my desk, it’ll be vetoed immediately.”
If the governor vetoes the bill as promised, it would take 40 of 60 legislators, meeting in joint session, to override him. Multiple legislators said that as of Thursday, the necessary votes were not present. 
“I do not believe in its current form, it will get through the process,” said Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer.
Some legislators, including Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, suggested that a smaller increase, on the order of $680 per student, might find success if coupled with policy changes.
The bill advancing toward a Senate vote was introduced at the start of the legislative session by Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, after Dunleavy vetoed a different bill, with a smaller funding increase, last year. Lawmakers failed to override the governor’s veto by a single vote.
Himschoot’s bill was repeatedly modified, and lawmakers held closed-door negotiating sessions with a representative of the Dunleavy administration in an effort to find a compromise between legislators’ preferences and the governor’s.
Most legislators have supported an unrestricted funding boost, which would allow school districts to choose how to spend the new money. The governor has introduced bills that place more emphasis on policy and would empower charter schools, homeschool parents, and alternatives to traditional schools.
The closed-door negotiations ended without success, and the House passed a bill focused on new funding. The Senate Education Committee amended that proposal to include policy items, a step toward the governor’s preferences, but in a statement, the governor said that version of the bill “does not pass muster.” 
Rather than try further modifications, the Senate Finance Committee acted Thursday to strip all policy measures from the bill and leave just the funding increase.
“There’s a lot of discussion on what level of funding the BSA should have,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the finance committee.
“We’re putting this forward to see what support there is on this funding level in this building and on the third floor,” he said, referring to the Capitol floor occupied by the governor’s office.
Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, objected to that line of thinking, saying that the bill must have more support than its failed predecessor from last year, Senate Bill 140.
“I just want to say on the record that if we’re going to get something done, it’s going to have to be a thoughtful compromise that is durable, that hopefully the governor and the (House) will accept to the degree that it has as many — I’ll say friends, supporters — plus one more — at least — than we had with SB 140, which unfortunately failed,” Kaufman said.
“And so I’m afraid we’re going down the path to failure.”

On the heels of a visit with the president about energy, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Thursday the industry needs stability, and he could see potential benefits to changing the way Montana chooses energy regulators.
Currently, Montanans elect five members of the Public Service Commission by district. The PSC regulates monopoly utilities, including NorthWestern Energy.
Senate Bill 561 proposes that two commissioners be elected, and three be appointed by the governor — with a two-thirds confirmation vote required by the Senate.
Gianforte said he would not weigh in on the bill specifically, but he also said that under the proposals’ need for bipartisan confirmation, commissioner appointees would be vetted “strictly based on competency.”

“What’s really important as energy demand increases is a regulatory climate that gives predictability to both consumers and producers,” said Gianforte, a Republican.
“Because these are very large investments these firms are making, sometimes hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, they need to know that the regulatory climate is going to be stable and predictable.”
The governor made his statements at a press conference after visiting Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump about energy and attending a signing of executive orders in support of the coal industry.
At the 2025 Montana Legislature, legislators also are taking up a number of measures related to energy — bills, resolutions, study proposals — some that are hotly debated, and others that have earned bipartisan support.
Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, is the sponsor of Senate Bill 561, which got out of the Senate with on a 34-14 vote with both Democrats and Republicans in favor of it.
At a hearing on Wednesday, he said it offers a new “hybrid” way for the Montana Public Service Commissioners to be seated.
Currently, Montanans elect all five commissioners by district, and at least a couple of the current commissioners want things to stay that way.
But Zolnikov, who works in the energy field, said the two elected commissioners would continue to give voice to the people of Montana, and the three appointed ones would be the “nerds,” those offering industry expertise.
“Why don’t these guys just run for office? Because they’re not politicians,” Zolnikov said.
He said the higher bar for their confirmation — two-thirds in the Senate — ensures that both Republicans and Democrats have a hand in the appointments.
The legislature has seen other bills that proposed appointing commissioners in previous sessions and the current one, including a hybrid bill tabled this year. Thirty-nine states appoint their commissioners.
At the hearing in the House State Administration Committee, PSC President Brad Molnar and Commissioner Annie Bukacek both spoke in opposition to the idea, Molnar in part because he feared “cronyism.”
He said he takes his job seriously, he came out of retirement to do it, and his interest is in leaving Montana with “a good, solid energy future.”
Molnar, a former Republican legislator and previous member of the PSC, said he didn’t think he would need to come to the legislature and “fight for basic democracy.”
Molnar is also concerned with how the public would react to appointments and potential favoritism.
“My dad works for a big company, and they made a big donation to the governor,” Molnar said of how appointees might explain their selection.
The Northern Plains Resource Council also opposed the bill.
However, the Chamber of Commerce and Pattern Energy spoke in support of it.
Charles Robison, with the Chamber, said the business community has had “significant concerns” about the makeup of the PSC, especially in recent years.
“We’ve seen that elected nature detract from its ability, I think, to be objective,” Robison said.
Charles Denowh, on behalf of Pattern Energy, said the bill would offer the right balance and “could create a more stable operating environment in the state.”
Pattern Energy operates a wind farm in Stillwater County and is developing one in Rosebud and Treasure Counties.
The committee did not take immediate action on the bill Wednesday.
 Governor talks ‘energy crisis’

At the press conference, Gianforte said he was grateful and proud to stand with the president as Trump issued orders that “pull the plug on Biden’s failed energy policy and flip the switch for American made energy.”
One of the orders said certain coal plants are allowed to comply with a less stringent version of federal regulations on Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for two years — “instead of the more onerous version put in place by the Biden Administration,” the White House said.
Gianforte said former President Joe Biden attacked Colstrip — site of a coal-fired electricity plant — and ended coal leases in the Powder River Basin through regulation.
Under Biden, he said, the cost of electricity rose “nearly 30%” and Gianforte pushed for an “all of the above” energy strategy, “like we have here in Montana.”
“As you’ve heard me say before, we have an energy crisis in the United States,” Gianforte said. “In fact, the energy crisis is one of the primary drivers in the affordability crisis.”
In a press release this week from the Montana Environmental Information Center, the nonprofit and health professionals criticized the orders from the president for harmful emissions from Colstrip, such as lead and arsenic.
“The Colstrip plant emissions are harming real people, disrupting real lives, and causing real economic damage,” said Dr. Robert Merchant, a Billings pulmonary physician, in a statement from the MEIC. “The economic benefits from reduced health issues in the region more than offset the implementation costs of pollution controls.”
Anne Hedges, executive director of the MEIC, said the modern energy era means it’s possible to protect health, save on health care bills, and decrease electricity costs at the same time.
“Harming health to eke out a bit more shareholder profit from a coal plant — especially one that’s the nation’s dirtiest for toxic emissions and is frequently broken when we need it most — is misguided, harmful and expensive.
“Perhaps the billionaires in charge don’t care about human health or their electricity bills, but everyday Montanans sure do.”
 Studying transmission, urging energy independence

In the legislature, Zolnikov’s Senate Joint Resolution 21 drew bipartisan support in the Senate with a 46-2 vote, and it heads to the House.
SJ 21 proposes an interim study on interstate power and grid development, including the legal and regulatory framework for the state to participate in “new cooperative interstate agreements for electric transmission.”
At a hearing last week, Zolnikov said the main idea behind the resolution is to expand people’s knowledge on the topic, so legislators could delve into policy that would help Montana.
“As energy is changing, adjusting, growing, and some is being removed, it’s a very important part of the pie, and it’s typically not always the one most discussed,” Zolnikov said.
In support of the resolution were the Montana Environmental Information Center, Grid United, Montana Renewable Energy Association, and Renewable Northwest.
Sponsored by Rep. Greg Kmetz, R-Miles City, House Joint Resolution 15 also received support from both the oil and gas industry and renewable energy representatives.
The resolution says Montana’s electrical grid has evolved, but the state needs additional and updated transmission infrastructure to move power for economic development, reliability and affordability.
The resolution is coasting through the legislature, last week earning unanimous approval in the Senate Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee.
The legislature is also looking at a controversial resolution to support energy production, House Joint Resolution 17.
It aims to “unleash American energy by reforming and streamlining permitting obligations and repealing or revising environmental regulations and environmental reviews that do not align with national security interests.”
Sponsored by Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, HJ 17 passed the House on mostly party lines, with Democrat Rep. Paul Tuss of Havre joining Republicans in support in its final vote.
Thursday, Tuss said he doesn’t like the language that lessens environmental safeguards, but he likes the idea of becoming even more energy independent, along with the jobs and economic expansion it would bring.
“Energy production and potential energy production is a frequent topic of interest along the Hi-Line and in my district,” Tuss said in a statement. “This resolution encourages the federal government to look into what’s possible concerning energy for the country.”
On the floor, the debate on HJ 17 was heated.
Fitzpatrick said it’s clear that energy is an issue, especially with the growing demand from artificial intelligence and computing, and Montana can’t solve all the problems at the state level.
“Many of them are related to federal policies and federal laws,” Fitzpatrick said. ”And what this bill very simply does is it asks Congress to sit down and get to work fixing some of the problems that have arisen.”
Rep. Debo Powers, D-Whitefish, said the idea of energy independence is a good goal, but she described the resolution as “appalling.”
Powers said it essentially calls for gutting federal environmental protections put in place after significant disasters, such as Love Canal, an historic, milestone contamination site.
“Our landmark environmental laws have restored our country’s water, air and land, and given substance to our God given right to clean air and water,” Powers said. “Let’s not go backwards. Let’s go forward.”
In support of the resolution, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said energy described as “clean” isn’t always so, such as all the concrete used to put wind turbines in place.
Ler said nobody wants to return to the days of dirty air and dirty water, and the federal government needs to be on board when it comes to energy needs or “our economy will cease to exist.”
“I’m from the East. We drill for oil. We drill for natural gas. And we dig for coal,” Ler said. “And we need this.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House passed a pair of budget bills that significantly cut Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s proposed spending for the next two years, sending the measures to the Senate even as the governor raised objections. 
In a series of votes Thursday that mostly followed party lines, House Republicans passed a budget that would spend $15.36 billion over two years, eliminate some state agencies, expand education freedom accounts for all residents, and incorporate a number of the party’s policy proposals. 
They did so in a budget proposal that spends $643 million less than Ayotte’s budget, which she unveiled in February.
And they did so despite a period of chaos Thursday evening in which a faction of Republicans voted with Democrats to briefly table one of the budget bills, House Bill 2.
Republicans said the reductions are necessary after the House Ways and Means Committee estimated lower revenues than what Ayotte’s budget predicted, and said the cuts are largely targeted toward unnecessary boards and agencies. And they pointed to new revenue sources added through a tax on video gaming and an increase in a number of fees.
“We had to do a lot of decision-making to close that gap,” said Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican. “And we did it the exact way that presumably you would do it if you found yourself in a similar situation where your expenses and your revenues diverge: We looked for more revenues.”
Democrats countered that the budget would slash programs and services that residents rely on, such as reproductive health centers and the university and community college systems, and that it would increase costs for some, such as the proposed premiums on Medicaid. And Democrats proposed their own version of the budget, which they called “the better budget,” and which fell on party lines.
But lawmakers on both sides acknowledged that Thursday’s vote is far from the last word. The budget heads next to the Senate Finance Committee, which must pass its own version by June 5. And Ayotte stood by her rosier revenue projections this week, and indicated that she will push the Senate to reverse many of the House’s cuts, such as its elimination of the Office of the Child Advocate. 
“Obviously, I spent a lot of time on my budget, and I wouldn’t have put it together if I didn’t think it was the right blueprint for the state,” she said at a press conference Wednesday. 
Rep. Jason Osborne, the House Republican majority leader, said the budget passed is a negotiating position for the House, even if much of it is later changed by the Senate.
“This is, once again, only the first step in a process of negotiating with the folks outside of this body, and … I want our positions to have a place at that negotiating table,” he said on the floor.
Still, Democrats assailed the cuts and at times drew contrasts to the governor’s approach.
“I remember sitting in this room two months ago, listening to the governor give her budget address and urging us to continue doing what is working,” said Rep. Karen Ebel, a New London Democrat. “I look at this budget and see too much of what’s working being cut.”

Republicans add legislative priorities
Throughout the day, Republicans tacked on additional policies through floor amendments, while Democrats tried unsuccessfully to roll back many of the changes. But one change was bipartisan. 
A group of House Republicans joined with Democrats in overturning a budget provision that imposes automatic year-to-year spending caps on school districts and requires a two-thirds majority vote to override. The House already passed a bill to do so, House Bill 200, which requires a slightly lower, three-fifths majority; that bill is being considered by the Senate. 
Other Republicans tacked on their own legislative priorities. 
The chamber passed a Republican amendment that would exempt firearms and accessories from the National Firearm Act, as long as they were kept in state and labeled “For NH use only. Not for export outside NH.” That would mean the firearms would not be subjected to regulations or taxes, but the measure could face court challenges.
The House narrowly voted to pass an amendment by Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, to restore the ability of cities and towns to allow keno facilities. The House Finance Committee’s budget had removed that ability.
The chamber also added into House Bill 2 an amendment that would roll back some anti-discrimination protections for transgender people and allow businesses and government entities to separate bathrooms, locker rooms, jails, and involuntary health care facilities by biological sex. 
And Rep. Ross Berry, of Weare, successfully passed an amendment to require city and town supervisors of the checklist to review their voter rolls once a year, rather than once every 10 years. Those supervisors would need to purge any voters who had not voted in the past five years; those voters would need to re-register to vote again. 
While many of the floor amendments added have already passed the House in the form of standalone bills, adding them to the budget could allow them to serve as bargaining chips when the House and Senate meet to negotiate the final budget documents in June. 
“This is just the first step in the process,” Osborne said. “It’s an invitation to the dance. And if we want to be able to dance in June with our friends across the wall, we’ll pass this budget today.”

Democrats wage opposition
Democrats, meanwhile, sought to add back the funding removed from Ayotte’s budget, and in some cases reverse some of Ayotte’s own budgeting choices. Almost every effort was voted down. 
That included unsuccessful attempts to restore $1.7 million in state funds allocated to pay for the state’s family planning program; $1 million for Ayotte’s fund to help schools with cell phone bans in schools; $30 million for the University System of New Hampshire; and $1.7 million for the state art fund and arts development account. 
Democrats also attempted, but failed, to restore the Office of the Child Advocate, the Human Rights Commission, the Housing Appeals Board, and the state Commission on Aging, all of which had been removed by Republicans. 
They pushed to reverse the premiums for Medicaid recipients first proposed by Ayotte and to reduce the Republican budget increase for education freedom accounts by $14 million in state fiscal year 2027. They sought to reverse a Republican amendment that would make special education funding paid for out of the state’s general fund, not the Education Trust Fund.
Rep. David Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat, attempted to take out the provision making education freedom accounts universal by fiscal year 2027, and to restore fiscal capacity disparity aid grants to the state’s school funding formula, which are meant to support towns that have low property values.
Rep. Hope Damon, a Croydon Democrat, proposed language to enroll the state in Medicaid Direct Certification, a federal program that allows schools to use Medicaid data to automatically sign families up for the free and reduced price lunch program. 
And Rep. Timothy Horrigan, a Durham Democrat, attempted to undo the House’s name change of the Office of Health Equity, which Republicans had moved to name the Office of Health Access. 
Democrats did win Republican support to restore $14 million to the state’s travel and tourism budget and funding to New Hampshire’s welcome centers, which had been defunded in the House Republican budget.
Democratic Party leaders held a rally in front of the State House Wednesday lambasting the Republican budget in front of around 150 supporters.
“The Republicans claim that they had no choice with this budget,” Democratic House Leader Alexis Simpson, of Exeter, said at the demonstration. “That they eliminated the arts, services for the most vulnerable, including children, abandoned our university system and fired hard-working people across the state government, because they had to. Let me be clear, every action that Republicans took in writing this budget was a choice.”
Osborne said the budget serves Granite Staters in other ways. 
“This budget does reflect our values,” he said. “It puts the New Hampshire taxpayers first, and not the bureaucracies that have ballooned and bloated since 2020.”

Ayotte pushes back
Speaking to reporters Wednesday ahead of the budget vote, Ayotte said she hopes to work with the Senate to restore a lot of the funding and programs the House eliminated from her proposal. She specifically cited as priorities the community mental health centers and funding meant to ensure there is no waitlist for people with developmental disabilities attempting to receive state services. She said she also wanted the Office of the Child Advocate and the Council on the Arts restored.
“Those are just a handful of things,” Ayotte said. “Obviously, there are many things that I’m going to be working with the Senate to prioritize and make sure that I get back in the priorities that were in my budget.”
She also stood by her financial projections, which House Republicans deemed overly optimistic, saying she is “confident that the revenue numbers that I laid out in my budget are actually more accurate revenue numbers than the lower proposals made by the House.” She argued this is “being borne out also by the first three months of the fiscal year and how revenues are coming in.”
“My budget clearly laid out my priorities,” Ayotte said.

SPRINGFIELD — The Sangamon County Sheriff’s Office came under intense scrutiny after an unarmed Black woman was shot and killed by a deputy in her Springfield home in July 2024.

The deputy charged with her murder, Sean Grayson, had a troubled employment record at other Central Illinois police agencies. Despite a former supervisor once asking Grayson “how are you still employed?” he was hired by Sangamon County in May 2023 only to have his career end 14 months later when he shot and killed 36-year-old Sonya Massey in her home.

The Illinois Senate advanced a pair of bills this week designed to address the community’s concerns about the tragedy and how it was handled.

“After that murder occurred, a lot of things came out with regard to the way that the deputy was hired, and also a lot of questionable activities that were in his background that Sangamon County was not aware of and did not have privy to before an offer of employment,” Sen. Doris Turner, D-Springfield, said.

Grayson, who is white, shot and killed Massey inside her house early on the morning of July 6. Body camera video shows Grayson and another deputy responding to a report of a prowler at her home. They didn’t find signs of anyone outside.

The situation went south after Massey asked the deputies if she could remove a pot of boiling water from the stove. Massey, who had a history of mental health episodes, told the deputies, “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,” and Grayson threatened to shoot Massey in the face. He then fired striking Massey and told other deputies responding to the shooting he feared Massey was going to throw the water at him.

Grayson was charged with first-degree murder and is awaiting trial as the Illinois Supreme Court weighs a request from his attorney to grant him pretrial release. A separate court ruling earlier this week moved the trial out of Sangamon County to Peoria County.

The Senate advanced legislation Wednesday to reform hiring at police agencies. Senate Bill 1953 sponsored by Turner was unanimously approved in the Senate.

The bill would require law enforcement agencies to review all aspects of a person’s background and employment before offering a position as an officer, including physical and psychological fitness-for-duty exams, work performance records, investigations involving the applicant and any prior arrests or criminal convictions.

“When it comes to hiring police officers, we want to ... ensure we have the most qualified people,” Turner said in a statement Wednesday.

Grayson was hired by Sangamon County despite troubles at past police agencies and two drunken driving convictions, a Capitol News Illinois investigation found. In one instance while working for Logan County, Grayson was told he needed “extensive” training after not listening to a supervisor’s orders to terminate a police chase. But when Grayson was hired by Sangamon County, the investigations in Logan County ended.

Grayson also served short stints at other central Illinois policy agencies, including Auburn, where the police chief complained Grayson was often too aggressive about drug busts and bragged about them on social media.

The bill also would require all counties with more than 75,000 people to create a sheriff’s merit board. Current state law only requires Cook County to have an independent board overseeing disciplinary matters.

A Sangamon County commission created after Massey’s death also recommended giving voters power to recall countywide elected officials.

Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell faced intense calls to resign after Massey’s shooting. After initially resisting them, he retired at the end of August 2024.

The Senate voted 35-19 Thursday to approve Senate Bill 1954. It would allow Sangamon County to present a referendum to voters in 2026 asking them to create a recall mechanism for certain countywide elected officials such as the sheriff. County treasurers, regional superintendents and district-elected officials such as county board members could not be recalled under the bill.

“I believe there is widespread support on the county board to put the question of recall before the voters of Sangamon County,” Sangamon County Board Chair Andy Van Meter said in a statement.

Some Republican senators said the bill should expand beyond Sangamon County.

“I think every elected official in the state of Illinois should be liable to recall by their constituents if they're not doing their job properly,” Sen. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville, said.

Only Cook County voters currently can recall officials.

The bills now await consideration in the House.

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., addresses the crowd at the Nebraska Republican election night watch party in Bellevue on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024. (Marissa Lindemann/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump endorsed Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in a still-hypothetical midterm race against former labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan who has had some Democratic support.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, said Ricketts has his “Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election.” 
He announced the endorsement Thursday, hours after Osborn released a poll showing him statistically tied with Ricketts. People familiar with the Ricketts endorsement process said it had been in the works for weeks and that Trump decided on the timing.
“Pete is one of the strongest Senators in the Country on Border Security, whereas his potential Opponent, Dan Osborn, is a Radical Left Open Border Extremist, who will put our Country, and Safety, LAST.” Trump wrote.
Trump added that Ricketts is “doing a terrific job for the People of Nebraska!” 
Earlier Thursday, Osborn drew headlines statewide about the poll showing him within one percentage point of Ricketts. Osborn announced last week that he was exploring another run for the Senate, this time against Ricketts. Ricketts served two terms as governor before Gov. Jim Pillen.

Ricketts’ campaign released a statement celebrating the endorsement, In a statement, Ricketts said he looked “forward to working with the President to continue advancing the America First agenda!”
“President Trump’s success in office is proof that conservative leadership matters,” he added. 
The senator, one of the most established figures in the Nebraska Republican Party, is running for a full six-year term after winning the November election to finish the final two years of former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term. Pillen appointed Ricketts to the seat in early 2023.
The endorsement appears to signal that Ricketts and Trump have patched up after being at odds in the 2022 Nebraska governor’s race. Ricketts endorsed and financially backed Pillen, who won. Trump endorsed his longtime donor Charles Herbster, a multistate agribusinessman.
Ricketts had asked Trump to avoid the 2022 race. Trump had also previously butted heads with Ricketts’ family members, some of whom had supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis against him. As governor, Ricketts sent the Nebraska National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border to help Texas with border security. As a senator, Ricketts has been in lock step with Trump’s agenda.
“Pete Ricketts and his party bosses in D.C. are clearly nervous about Dan Osborn, and they should be,” an Osborn campaign spokesman said.
Republicans have won almost complete power in America’s heartland, a region once known for its prairie progressivism. If Osborn could unseat any of Nebraska’s federal delegation, it would be the first time a non-Republican had represented Nebraska in Congress since Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford upset Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Terry in the 2nd District in 2014.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City federal judge on Thursday threw out a lawsuit against state Superintendent Ryan Walters that accused him of defaming a former Norman High School teacher whose classroom display against book censorship made national news.
U.S. District Judge Bernard Jones ruled that former teacher Summer Boismier made herself a public figure during the controversy and therefore would have to prove a higher standard of “actual malice” to win the defamation case. Actual malice is defined as having a reckless disregard for the truth or publicizing a statement while knowing it is false.
Jones decided Boismier’s lawsuit failed to prove that Walters committed actual malice when he accused her of sharing pornographic books with students and when he incorrectly claimed she had been fired from Norman Public Schools.
Boismier’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday afternoon.
Walters celebrated the ruling as a victory for parental rights, students and educational integrity.
“We have sent a clear message that Oklahoma’s schools will remain free from political indoctrination and that our children deserve an education that is focused on core academic values, not the promotion of controversial ideologies,” Walters said in a statement.
In August 2022, Boismier covered the bookshelves in her English classroom with red paper on which she wrote, “books the state doesn’t want you to read.” She also posted a QR code linking to the Brooklyn Public Library’s BooksUnbanned initiative — an online collection of books available to young people across the country.
Boismier said she made the classroom display in protest of House Bill 1775, an Oklahoma law passed in 2021 to prohibit certain race and gender topics from being discussed in public school classrooms.
After two Oklahoma districts were penalized that year over HB 1775, the Norman district asked its teachers to remove books from their classrooms until they read each one or could cite two academic sources to verify the title was age-appropriate for students.
Boismier voluntarily resigned from Norman a few days after a student complained of the display. She said HB 1775 “created an impossible working environment for teachers and a devastating learning environment for students.” 
She spoke to numerous media outlets about the controversy and wrote an opinion column in The Oklahoman, actions that Jones said contribute to her status as a public figure on the issue of HB 1775’s impact on education. 
Some media outlets initially reported incorrectly that Boismier had been fired.
Walters at the time was running as a Republican candidate for state superintendent. He posted a statement on his social media accounts calling for Boismier’s teaching certification to be revoked and repeated the incorrect claim that Norman had fired her.
He later changed his public statement to say she resigned “rather than face removal.”
The Norman district has maintained that Boismier never violated state law and wasn’t disciplined.
“Perhaps a more responsible or reasonable public official would have — and as a matter of public trust, should have — done more to verify his claim before taking to Twitter,” Jones wrote in his decision. “But that failure, standing alone, does not warrant a jury trial.”
Walters contended the online library collection included books, like the graphic novel “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe, that contained sexual content. Boismier said she didn’t recommend students read any specific book from the catalogue.
Jones described pornographic material as difficult to define but he acknowledged certain imagery found in the graphic novel “arguably lends itself to such a characterization.”
“Where the line between what is and isn’t pornographic is so imprecise, the Court has trouble concluding that Walters’s characterization, however controversial, reflects an inference of known falsity or a reckless disregard for the truth,” the judge wrote.
Since the incident, Boismier moved to New York City to accept a position at the Brooklyn Public Library.
Walters and the Oklahoma State Board of Education formally revoked Boismier’s teaching certification in August, despite a separate judge finding the state agency failed to prove she deserved such a penalty.
Boismier sued the state board in Oklahoma County District Court to challenge the revocation. That case is still pending.
“It should be an easy call for the courts to overturn it, since Walters chose to throw out the actual facts and law in the case to get the results he wanted and campaigned on,” Her attorney, Brady Henderson, said at the time.
The state’s treatment of Boismier means “Oklahoma teachers now apparently have to fear getting their licenses revoked for criticizing the wrong politician or showing students how to get a library card,” Henderson said after the revocation.
Jones rejected the notion that Boismier or anyone else should be dissuaded from “speaking loudly and passionately about causes in which they believe.”
“She, like all others, is free to publicly disagree with this state’s politicians, subject to the protections and limits of the First Amendment,” Jones wrote. “But when one voluntarily steps out from the shadows of private life to speak on a matter of public controversy, the Supreme Court has made clear that the burden to prevail in a defamation action is a formidable one. And here, the Court concludes that Boismier has not met it.”

Mike Lee, R-Utah, participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)Utah Sen. Mike Lee introduced a bill this week that would prohibit federal employees from doing union-related work while on the clock. 
It’s similar, in some ways, to a bill passed at the state level this year that changes how Utah’s public unions operate. 
Lee’s bill, called the “No Union Time on the Taxpayer’s Dime Act,” changes federal code to prohibit what’s called “official time,” a longstanding practice established by Congress in 1978 that allows public employees to conduct certain union-related activities during work hours. 
That includes “representational activities,” according to the American Federation of Government Employees — things like creating fair promotional procedures, establishing flexible work hours, or enforcing protections from unlawful discrimination.

Lee’s bill states that “any activities performed by an employee relating to the business of a labor organization shall be performed during the time the employee is in a non-duty status.” 
“President Trump is taking strong steps to rein in overpowered public sector unions, which even Democrat leaders like FDR thought shouldn’t exist in the first place,” said Lee, a Republican, in a statement earlier this week. “American taxpayers shouldn’t have to fund union organizing, and federal employees should be working full time for the American people when they’re on the clock.”
That statement mirrors the rhetoric from some state lawmakers this past legislative session while discussing HB267, a divisive bill that bans public unions from engaging in collective bargaining. 
Effort to overturn union bill through referendum gains steam, with 130,000 signatures in support

In addition to the ban, HB267 also prohibits public employers from using public money or property to “assist or support union activity; compensate a public employee or a third party for union activity; provide a public employee paid leave that is in addition to the public employee’s regularly accrued leave to allow the public employee to participate in union activity.” 
Utah’s bill is currently being challenged by a coalition of labor groups in the state, which are currently collecting signatures in hopes of overturning it by way of a referendum. 
Lawmakers, both at the state and federal level, say these bills are an attempt to safeguard taxpayer funds. Lee’s office pointed to a 2016 Office of Personnel Management report that found federal employees spent a collective 3.6 million hours dedicated to union-related activities, or official time, costing taxpayers $177.2 million. 
However, advocates of official time say eliminating the practice could ultimately cost taxpayers more. Official time is often used to resolve workplace issues internally — without it, federal employees could have to resort to litigation instead, which would be more timely and costly for taxpayers. 
“Taking away official time is union busting, plain and simple. Official time is a vital tool used by employees and management to address workplace issues, quickly and amicably. Through official time, we’ve protected veterans’ preference in hiring, prevented discrimination against veterans with PTSD and expedited the processing of benefits for veterans and their families,” said the American Federation of Government Employees in a video several years ago. The federation represents about 820,000 federal employees, including many at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Lee’s bill is much more narrow than Utah’s, and doesn’t include any kind of ban on collective bargaining for public unions — that’s because he doesn’t have to. In March, Trump signed an executive order banning collective bargaining for unions representing employees with national security missions. 
According to the Associated Press, that includes Departments of State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Health and Human Services, Treasury, Justice, Commerce and Homeland Security.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The chief sponsor of a library content bill faced bipartisan pushback Thursday from legislators who questioned the need for the bill, a lack of engagement with librarians and outdated data.
North Dakota Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, appeared before the House Appropriations Committee to discuss Senate Bill 2307. The bill would require school and public libraries to relocate books deemed “sexually explicit” to areas not easily accessible by minors. The bill also proposes that local state’s attorneys would investigate and prosecute violations, and state funds could be withheld from schools or libraries in violation.
A fiscal note estimates it would cost the state about $2 million through 2029 to comply with the bill. That’s the estimated cost to add an age-verification system for an online database used by North Dakota libraries.

Boehm introduced an amendment Thursday to remove the section of the bill that affects online content, which would eliminate the fiscal note.
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, told Boehm his amendment would add a “really large loophole” to his bill.
“If it’s a huge concern, it seems like it would be an inconsistent application of your policy just to eliminate a fiscal note in order to get it passed,” Hanson said.
Other lawmakers pointed out the estimated fiscal impact does not include expenses local libraries or schools would incur.
Lawmakers in 2023 passed House Bill 1205, which required books with sexually explicit content to be removed from the children’s section. It also required libraries to develop policies for reviewing and removing content.
Rep. Steve Swiontek, R-Fargo, questioned the need for the latest bill and said some of Boehm’s testimony was misleading. 
Boehm provided committee members with the 2023 American Library Association list of the top 10 most challenged books, along with a list of North Dakota libraries that had those books. Many of the books have LGBTQ themes or discuss sexual assault. 
Committee members pointed out the books were on the list because they had been challenged at libraries across the country, not because they were deemed to be obscene. Boehm also acknowledged he had not verified if the controversial books were in children’s sections of North Dakota libraries.
Rep. Eric Murphy, R-Grand Forks, pointed to a book on the list called “Sold,” a story about a young Nepalese woman who was sold into sex trafficking. 
“Would this not, perhaps, be a good book for some of our older, adolescent girls to perhaps read?” Murphy asked.
Boehm said it depends on if the content sexualizes children.
Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, said it was troublesome that Boehm told the committee that he did not speak to any librarians, members of the library association or school board association when crafting the bill. 
In response to a question from Mitskog, Boehm said he has visited five North Dakota libraries in the past four years while working to address concerns about library content. 
“I’m expressing a bit of frustration by the lack of engagement and I encourage sitting down with those groups,” Mitskog said.
Boehm said even though he had not engaged those stakeholders, it didn’t mean that the bill’s other sponsors had not reached out to them.
Rep. Brandy Pyle, R-Casselton, said the data Boehm provided the committee is two years old and she would have liked more information to help her make a decision.
“It definitely feels like you are giving us one side of the story rather than the whole story,” Pyle said. 
Rep. Mike Brandenburg, R-Edgeley, said he has constituents who want lawmakers to take action on library content. He said more than 200 people signed a petition objecting to a book in the Forman school library, but the school continues to have the book. The book is from the “Heartstopper” LGBTQ+ graphic novel series.
“You can’t say it’s not happening in North Dakota,” he said.

Jonathan Byers, a member of the State’s Attorneys’ Association, recommended the committee give the bill a do-not-pass recommendation. 
He said a majority of county prosecutors do not employ investigators and the bill would likely require offices to add staff.
The added duties would include investigating each instance brought by concerned citizens, evaluating whether the content qualifies as obscene, issuing an opinion and possible removal order and following up if content is not removed.
Byers said he didn’t believe state’s attorneys were consulted about the bill.
The committee took no immediate action after the hearing. The bill previously received a do-pass recommendation from the House Judiciary Committee and advanced in the Senate on a 27-20 vote.

Such centers rely on funding from Medicaid, which congressional Republicans want to cut. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Bellevue state senator’s priority bill to remove a lifetime ban on public food assistance for Nebraskans convicted of drug felonies advanced Thursday to its next law-making step, despite resistance from a fellow Sarpy County lawmaker.
Currently, Nebraska has a narrow exception to the ban for people with one or two drug possession or drug use felony convictions. They can access Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known as food stamps, if they have completed a licensed and accredited treatment program.

Legislative Bill 319, championed by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, would open the door for other felony drug offenders who currently can’t access SNAP benefits, as long as they’ve completed their sentence or are on parole or under post-release supervision.
A 32-5 vote moved LB 319 forward. Seven lawmakers were present and did not vote.
 ‘Piece of the puzzle’

The most vocal opponent was State Sen. Bob Andersen, also of Sarpy County.
“They chose to be a drug dealer, and now when they come out of prison you want to give them more money in food stamps,” said Andersen, who is serving his first term. 
Rountree, also a freshman lawmaker, said his time on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee has given him a deeper appreciation of the rehabilitation needs for those transitioning out of prison.
He and others noted that Nebraskans who kill or rape someone can get access to SNAP benefits after they’ve served their sentences. But that’s not the same for people with certain felony drug convictions.
“That doesn’t make sense to me,” said State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward. “At what point do you get to become a citizen of the United States again and try to do better?”
Rountree said his bill is “a piece of the puzzle” needed to fortify inmate rehabilitation efforts and continues the effort led in the last legislative session by State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha.

About 1,000 Nebraskans would be impacted by his bill, Rountree said. It comes with no additional state cost, according to a fiscal analysis, as SNAP benefits are paid with federal funds. SNAP provides low-income people with a stipend to buy food at certain retailers and also has an employment and training component.
“Everybody has to eat,” Rountree said, adding that hunger can lead to circumstances that increase the chances of someone committing another crime.
“It’s righting a wrong. It’s righting an injustice,” said State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a proponent.
She noted that 220 people wrote in support of the bill, versus 12 who opposed it. 
 Not swayed 

Andersen, questioning Rountree during legislative debate, said those affected should turn to nonprofits and philanthropic groups – not the government – for help after they’ve served their time in prison.
He was not swayed by comments from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering who noted that three of the “most conservative states around us” already have laws accomplishing the same goal as LB 319, Iowa, South Dakota and Wyoming.
  State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County.  (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Rountree said if the change were adopted into law, Nebraska would join 26 other states in opting out of the complete ban.
 Hardin said that when the ban is in place, the recidivism goes up “pretty dramatically from about 3% to about 10%.” He said without the change, more people would go back to prison because of bad things they do outside of prison when they don’t have access to food.
Said Andersen: “Just cause all the other states are doing it doesn’t mean we should, too.” 
 Ban dates back to 1996 

The ban dates back to 1996 welfare reform and the nation’s “war on drugs.” States can pass laws to opt out or modify the ban.
That is how Nebraska previously created the exception for people with lesser drug offenses. A full prohibition remains for those with a felony conviction for drug sale or distribution.
  State Sens. Victor Rountree of Bellevue and Megan Hunt of Omaha. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte was a yes vote but said he was conflicted partly because the bill didn’t cut off benefits after a certain number of felony drug offenses.
Rountree said he was willing to work with Jacobson and others before the bill is debated at a later stage. He said the bill had much support during a previous public hearing. Proponents include the Lincoln police chief and the Omaha Police Officers Association. 
“If our law enforcement says this is going to help us have better interactions on the streets. If it is going to cut that recidivism rate down … then my fellow senators, this is what we need to do,” said Rountree.

Ned Lamont said that while CT must brace for cuts in federal aid, the state is better prepared to manage the crisis than most others.","Gov. Ned Lamont tried to ease worries over eroding federal aid Thursday, assuring residents that while Connecticut must brace for reduced help from Washington, the state is better prepared to manage the crisis than most others.
Speaking at a late afternoon press conference, Lamont also said he isn’t ready to commit funds that Connecticut has used in recent years to shrink its considerable pension debt to mitigate the pain of federal cuts. But he also was careful not to rule anything out.
“I don’t want to overstate what’s going on, because every day it changes,” Lamont said, adding that the press conference would be the first of a series of semi-regular televised updates on federal funding, like those he offered five years ago when the coronavirus pandemic struck Connecticut. “We’re not going to relive those days, but there is another period we’re going through right now with a lot of unpredictability and uncertainty.”
The largest program on the federal chopping block, Medicaid, remains unresolved. But Congress has set a goal of achieving more than $880 billion in federal budget cuts, a benchmark that can’t be achieved without deeply slashing a Medicaid program that is sending more than $6 billion to Connecticut this year.
The Lamont administration has outlined various scenarios under which Connecticut could lose anywhere from $186 million to closer to $1 billion annually, but the governor said he hopes the state will have greater clarity on this before the regular General Assembly session closes on June 4.
Lamont and three of his department heads did outline more than $300 million in federal grants for Connecticut that already either have been canceled, had new conditions placed upon them, or are at risk of being recalled based upon recent statements from the Trump administration.
Nearly two-thirds of those funds are related to public health or addiction treatment programs. Attorney General William Tong has challenged those reductions, which Trump imposed without congressional approval. A federal court has temporarily halted those cuts, but Lamont said that Connecticut must prepare for the likelihood that support in this area will be reduced, through one legal mechanism or another.
“I can’t stick my head in the sand,” he said. “We’re going to be prepared.”
Roughly $100 million in at-risk funding involves environmental, security and emergency management programs, and Lamont said Washington seems to have forgotten a decade of “incredible environmental hits.”
The Trump administration recently warned that the Federal Emergency Management Agency soon would be ending its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities [BRIC] grant program, which covers 75% of local environmental projects.
Katie Dykes, the commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said Connecticut has about $90 million in BRIC grants at risk, involving projects to safeguard a coastal substation in Bridgeport and the New Haven train station.
Another $9 million in federal emergency management and homeland security grants appear stalled. All communities in Connecticut benefit from these dollars, which support training exercises and specialized services such as bomb squads and search-and-rescue teams, said Brenda Bergeron, head of the state Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
Ronnell A. Higgins, the commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, said state officials already have begun discussions with their municipal counterparts about how to finance emergency services going forward.
“We’re going to have to think differently now,”  Higgins added.
Not all of Lamont’s assessment of the federal funding was gloomy. Trump has expressed support for continued healthy investments in the nation’s transportation infrastructure, and Lamont said, “I feel pretty confident that [the] significant federal resources that are going in alongside our Connecticut dollars to rebuild our roads and bridges and rail … will continue. At least we don’t see as much jeopardy there, which is particularly good news.”
Connecticut received $1.4 billion in federal construction funding last fiscal year, pairing it with $875 million in state borrowing to pay for transportation projects.
Lamont not ready to reshape CT’s ‘fiscal guardrails’ yet
Lamont added that while states’ relationships with the federal government are clearly evolving, Connecticut is better prepared than most others to shoulder additional burdens — though it cannot replace all federal aid that likely will be eventually cut.
Connecticut holds a record-setting $4.1 billion in its emergency budget reserve, but “I really need that rainy day fund to protect against the recession,” said Lamont, who added he fears the next economic downturn will be “severe.”
Despite a decision by Trump to pause some of the tariffs imposed in recent months, those trade duties have heightened many economists’ fears of rising inflation and a softening stock market.
But the governor isn’t ready to take a step his fellow Democrats in the state House and Senate majorities did this week.
Connecticut established a series of budget caps in 2017 that have generated unprecedented surpluses — an average of $1.8 billion per year, or about 8% of the General Fund. Critics charge the program has been too aggressive, leeching needed dollars away from core programs, weakening education, health and child care, social services and municipal aid.
Democratic leaders said one of the chief caps driving those surpluses should be modified so Connecticut could tap some of that savings to offset the most painful federal cuts. The governor says it’s too soon to commit those dollars, suggesting lawmakers here wait until the end of the legislative session to see what else develops in Washington.
“I’m not there yet,” said Lamont.
A fiscal moderate, Lamont has been wary throughout his tenure to use state dollars to compensate for reduced federal funding. 
But while Lamont acknowledged those concerns Wednesday, the governor added that “circumstances seem to be changing, don’t they.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who fought two years ago to boost Connecticut’s budget reserve to its $4.1 billion level, said Thursday that “this is not a decision we have to make today.”
Ritter said Democratic lawmakers have “a lot of angst and concerns” but don’t disagree with the governor that a pool of emergency state funds to offset federal cuts doesn’t have to be created immediately. “No one disagrees with the timing on this.”

,DC,2025-04-10 23:36:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Supreme Court says Trump administration must 'facilitate' return of wrongly deported man,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-says-trump-administration-must-facilitate-return-wrongly-deported-man,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday ruled the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of a Maryland man to the United States after he was wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, but stopped short of requiring his return.The high court said the Trump administration must try to bring back Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, of Beltsville, who was deported due to an “administrative error” admitted by the Trump administration.The high court did not give the administration a date by which to return Abrego Garcia, saying the deadline in a District of Columbia court order has expired. The Supreme Court said the district court also needs to clarify what it meant by saying the administration must “effectuate” the return of Abrego Garcia and the scope of that term is “unclear” and may exceed the district court’s authority.The Trump administration has repeatedly rejected retrieving Abrego Garcia from prison.  President Donald Trump and other high-ranking officials have alleged Abrego Garcia is a MS-13 gang member, but produced no evidence and have defended his deportation, despite admitting his removal was a mistake.  “We don’t want them back,” Trump said April 8, referencing the case. “Can you imagine, you spend all of that time, energy and money on getting them out, and then you have a judge that sits there… (saying), he said, ‘No, bring him back.’”It’s unclear how long Abrego Garcia will remain in the prison unless he is returned to the U.S., but El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said based on the $6 million agreement between his country and the U.S., those men at the prison will remain there for at least a year.Bukele is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House Monday.Effect on other prisonersThursday’s decision may have ramifications for the 238 Venezuelans who were deported to the same prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.They were sent there under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law their attorneys say denied them due process because those subject to it were not able to challenge their removal in court.The Supreme Court will allow, for now, the continued removal of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, but those subject to a presidential proclamation issued by Trump citing the Alien Enemies Act must be given notice of their removal under the wartime law and a court hearing. The court action also must be in the locations where they are incarcerated.Arrested while driving sonThe Abrego Garcia case garnered national attention when he was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while driving his 5-year-old son home. Abrego Garcia was not charged with an offense, but was apprehended by ICE because his “status had changed.”In 2019 Abrego Garcia was given a final order of removal, but an immigration judge granted him protection from removal to his home country because it was more ""likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador"" if he was returned, according to court documents.But on March 15 he was placed on one of three deportation flights to El Salvador.The Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody and therefore cannot be returned to the United States.There is precedent from the U.S. government to return an immigrant accidentally deported, including U.S. citizens. Between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2020, ICE accidentally deported 70 U.S. citizens who needed to be returned, according to a 2021 U.S. Government Accountability Office report.",,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

The pipeline caused a major oil spill a decade ago, fouling the ocean off Santa Barbara County. The new owners say they don’t need new permits for repairs. The fine is the Coastal Commission’s largest.



The California Coastal Commission today fined an oil company a record $18 million for repeatedly defying orders to stop work on a corroded pipeline in Santa Barbara County that caused a major oil spill nearly a decade ago.
The vote sets the stage for a potentially high-stakes test of the state’s power to police oil development along the coast. The onshore pipeline in Gaviota gushed more than 100,000 gallons of crude oil onto coastal land and ocean waters, shutting down fisheries, closing beaches and harming marine life and coastal habitats in 2015.
Sable Offshore Corp., a Houston-based company, purchased the pipeline from the previous owners, Exxon Mobil, last year, and is seeking to restart the Santa Ynez offshore oil operation. 
The Coastal Commission said Sable has done something no alleged violator has ever done before: ignoring the agency’s multiple cease-and-desist orders and continuing its work.
“Our orders were valid and legally issued, and Sable’s refusal to comply is a refusal to follow the law,” said Commissioner Meagan Harmon, who also is a member of the Santa Barbara City Council. “Their refusal, in a very real sense, is a subversion of the will of the people of the state of California.”
“I’ve never taken how special this area is for granted. As a kid, I was traumatized by the ’69 oil spill, and in 2015, I had to watch my own kids go through the same trauma.”Carol Millar, Santa Barbara County resident
The company argued it can proceed using the pipeline’s original county permit issued in the 1980s. In February, Sable sued the Coastal Commission saying the state is unlawfully halting the company’s repair and maintenance work.
At a 5-hour public hearing in Santa Barbara today, more than 100 speakers lined up, many of them urging the commission to penalize Sable and stop its work. Some invoked memories of the 2015 Refugio OIl Spill as well as the massive 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill caused by a blowout on a Union Oil drilling rig. Public outrage over that spill helped shape the environmental movement, led to the first Earth Day and contributed to the enactment of many national environmental laws.
“I’ve never taken how special this area is for granted,” said Santa Barbara County resident Carol Millar. “As a kid, I was traumatized by the ’69 oil spill, and in 2015, I had to watch my own kids go through the same trauma.”
Steve Rusch, Sable’s vice president of environmental and governmental affairs, said the commission was overreaching because of the spill caused by the previous owners.
“We are proud of our good-paying, skilled jobs that our project has brought to the region,” he told commissioners. “It’s not about the 2015 Refugio oil spill. It’s not about the restart of the pipeline …it’s not about the future of oil production or fossil fuel in California.”
“We are proud of our good-paying, skilled jobs that our project has brought to the region. It’s not about the 2015 Refugio oil spill.”Steve Rusch, Sable Offshore corp.
In repairing the former, corroded pipelines, the company is seeking to restart production of the Santa Ynez oil operation, which includes three offshore rigs, according to an investor presentation by the company. Operations stopped after the 2015 spill.  
Sable had been excavating around the former pipelines and placing cement bags on the seafloor below its oil and water pipelines.
The Coastal Commission’s fine levied against Sable is the highest ever levied against a company, according to a commission spokesperson. The commission voted to lower the $18 million fine to potentially just under $15 million if Sable complies with the state’s orders and applies for a coastal development permit.
Beginning last year, commission staff charged the company with multiple violations of coastal laws, including unpermitted construction and excavation along a 14-mile oil pipeline on the Gaviota Coast, including areas offshore.
The enforcement division of the commission said Sable undertook major work at multiple locations without securing the required coastal development permits.
The company dug large pits, cleared vegetation, graded roads, placed concrete offshore among other work, according to a presentation by the staff today. In its presentation, commission staff said these actions went beyond routine maintenance and amounted to a full rebuild of the pipeline.
Coastal Commission officials emphasized that the work posed serious risks to the environment, including wetlands and other sensitive habitats, potentially harming protected species, including western pond turtles and steelhead.
 “The timing of the implemented development is particularly problematic, as much of this development has been during bird nesting season, as well as red-legged frog breeding season and Southern Steelhead migratory spawning season,” said Stephanie Cook, an attorney with the commission. “This work has a high potential to adversely impact these habitat areas.”
The staff said it spent months trying to get Sable to cooperate but the company provided incomplete or misleading information.
“The timing…is particularly problematic, as much of this development has been during bird nesting season, as well as red-legged frog breeding season and Southern Steelhead migratory spawning season.”Stephanie Cook, Coastal Commission Attorney
Rusch, in a statement issued after the hearing, said the company is conducting routine pipeline repair and maintenance, and said the actions were allowed under old permits issued by Santa Barbara County. The work is taking place in areas already affected by previous construction and use, and the company says the state cannot override the county’s interpretation of its permits. 
“Sable is dedicated to restarting project operations in a safe and efficient manner,” Rusch said in the statement. “No California business should be forced to go through a protracted and arbitrary permitting process when it already has valid permits for the work it performed.”
However, the validity of the county permit for the pipeline is in dispute. The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors in a February vote did not approve transferring the county permit to Sable, the new owner. The vote was 2-2, with one member abstaining because the pipeline runs through her property. County officials are still trying to decide their next step.
One concern of county officials is whether Sable has the financial ability and adequate insurance to handle a major oil spill. 
The pipeline dispute comes as the Trump administration moves to boost domestic oil and gas production while sidelining efforts to develop wind and solar. 
Several workers who said they were affiliated with the company spoke out in support along with others who said the company would boost the local economy. 
Evelyn Lynn, director of operations at Aspen Helicopters in Oxnard, said she supported Sable’s efforts because it would give her company a boost.“If they’re not allowed to start their efforts again, this will have huge collateral damage to all of our local businesses, and also to our company in particular, and all of our local people who live here,” Lynn said. “All of our employees are required to live in California. They are all local, and they are all affected.”
The Coastal Commission’s permits are not the only step the company has to take to operate the pipeline. Multiple state agencies regulate pipelines, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Office of Oil Spill and Prevention Response and the Office of the State Fire Marshal.
Environmental groups have called for a full environmental review of the pipeline under the California Environmental Quality Act. 
National environmental organizations such as the Center for Biological Diversity have weighed in, along with local advocates, to support the Coastal Commission. A group born out of the original Santa Barbara oil spill — the Environmental Defense Center — opposes the project and efforts to restart drilling. The Surfrider Foundation also launched a “Don’t Enable Sable” campaign, and several beachgoers spoke out against the project.

After a three day hearing this week, State Farm is one step closer to approval for a rate hike on its California customers.


State Farm could soon win final approval to raise premiums for California homeowners and others on an interim basis, a move meant to help prop up the finances of the state’s biggest provider of property insurance, after a public hearing this week.
In early February, State Farm asked California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to approve emergency interim rate increases, saying the Los Angeles Country fires had worsened its financial situation as it awaited the Insurance Department’s decision on rate requests it submitted last summer. State Farm said it expects to pay more than $7 billion worth of claims from those fires.
Lara’s department and State Farm reached an agreement ahead of this week’s hearing. The outcome of an unusual rate hearing in Oakland over the past three days, overseen by administrative law judge Karl-Fredric Seligman, would make it official. 
If the judge approves, starting in June the company’s customers will see average increases of 17% for homeowners — down from the 22% the insurer originally requested after it reached a deal with the California Insurance Department; 15% for renters and condos; and 38% for rental dwellings.
The judge, who gave no clear indication about his decision, is expected to issue one as soon as possible, perhaps within a couple of weeks.
If he does not approve the agreement, it’s unclear what will happen. The judge works for the insurance department, over which Lara has the ultimate decision-making authority. Lara has already conditionally approved the interim rates
At the hearing, Nikki McKennedy, assistant chief counsel for the department’s rate enforcement bureau, said during opening arguments that the interim rates were needed because “we can’t allow State Farm, with its 20% market share (in California), to go bankrupt.” She said the department “worked hard” to secure concessions from State Farm, including the reduction of the homeowner rate increase. The insurer also will get $400 million in a surplus note from its parent company, State Farm Mutual, and promised no new non-renewals of any more policies through the end of the year. 
The department’s actuary, Tina Shaw, testified that she agreed with the terms of the deal between the department and State Farm, though she said she had not made any calculations related to the impact of the revised proposed interim homeowner rate increase, 17%. Shaw said the department’s counsel gave her the figure, and that she agreed that it was an acceptable interim rate pending a full rate hearing that’s scheduled to begin in June. 
She also noted that after the department further examines the company’s finances, if the approved interim rate is shown to be excessive, policyholders will be eligible for refunds, with interest, from State Farm.
Lara asked the company’s executives questions about its finances during an in-person meeting in late February, but he was not satisfied with their responses. He called for the public rate hearing, saying the company needed to further prove its case. 
State Farm had a setback in trying to do so at the hearing this week. The judge disqualified the actuary the insurer hired to testify about justifying its requested rates because it turned out she was also under contract to the insurance department. Both the insurance department and Consumer Watchdog, the advocacy group that argued against granting State Farm’s rate request, raised objections about a possible conflict of interest.

The main arguments State Farm’s witnesses made about its financial situation mostly echoed previously disclosed information: State Farm said after the fires that it expected its surplus of $1.04 billion at the end of last year to decline by $400 million. An insurer’s surplus is its assets minus its liabilities, and is supposed to be a backup in case other sources of funds for claims are exhausted.
David Appel, an economist, testified that State Farm’s risk-based capital ratio of 150% — its amount of capital compared with its risk — is almost at a point where a regulator might need to intervene to help with its solvency. Appel said “the fact that the largest insurer of the largest state is almost at (regulatory action level) is extraordinary.” 
Appel also reiterated what the company has been saying for a while: that AM Best, a credit rating agency, downgraded its credit rating last year, and that another agency, S&P, has placed State Farm on a credit watch. Because further downgrades could result in State Farm failing to meet the minimum requirements to insure homes with mortgages, Appel said it puts hundreds of thousands of State Farm customers with mortgages at risk of losing their insurer.
But William Pletcher, Consumer Watchdog’s lead attorney, said: “Policyholders are not insurance company investors. They’re not here to bail out insurance companies.” Pletcher also said in his closing argument that the company had not proven its need for an interim rate; that it instead argued that “it was too big to fail.”
Consumer Watchdog also argued that according to California’s voter-approved insurance law, Proposition 103, an insurer may be granted an interim rate only when it can prove its current rates are invalid. The group’s actuary, Ben Armstrong, testified that according to his calculations, the company had not proven its case — though State Farm’s attorneys pointed out that in some cases his calculations were consistent with theirs, and also that he made a couple of mistakes.
Last spring, State Farm raised homeowner premiums an average 20%, before it requested more increases over the summer. The full rate hearing for those requests are scheduled for June 1, the same day the interim rates are set to take effect.
State Farm and the insurance department did get Armstrong to acknowledge that the insurance company’s finances appear to be at risk. But he said that if State Farm gets the interim rate increase, another risk is that other insurance companies will also ask for interim rates, “driving unaffordability for California policyholders.” 
In State Farm’s closing argument, attorney Katherine Wellington said if the company’s interim rate hikes are not approved “in this moment of crisis,” that would also be a risk for California policyholders.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/012625_Eaton-Fire-Rain_JH_CM_69.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

(Photo by Julia Goldberg / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office confirmed on Thursday that Daniel Werwath, her housing policy adviser, left his job last week.
In an interview on Thursday afternoon, Werwath said the governor’s office told him they’re “going in a different direction on housing” and terminated his employment. The governor’s employees work at will, meaning they can be fired for any legal reason.
Werwath’s last day on the job was on April 3, Communications Director Michael Coleman told Source NM in an email on Thursday.
“Gov. Lujan Grisham appreciates Daniel’s contributions in developing housing policy for New Mexico, including crafting financing proposals and working with the legislature,” Coleman said in a statement. “The governor thanks Daniel for his service and wishes him well in his future endeavors.”
During the most recent legislative session and the previous one, Werwath helped spearhead a failed proposal that would have created a new Office of Housing, Planning and Production in the executive branch. He said on Thursday it was the ultimate reason he joined the governor’s office in the first place.
He said he was surprised the proposal didn’t get passed, and that it “basically got killed” this time around because Senate Finance Committee Chair Sen. George Muñoz would not schedule it for a hearing.
“The system we have in New Mexico is, a single person can kill something if they’re a committee chair, and that’s wild, after four committee hearings with bipartisan votes,” Werwath said. “It’s pretty wild that that’s the way we do things.”
Werwath took on his role at the governor’s office in January 2024, following several decades of work in affordable housing, including as executive director of New Mexico Inter-Faith Housing and acting executive director of The Housing Trust and Tierra Contenta Corporation.
He said he is proud of what the Office of Housing in the governor’s office has been able to accomplish since, including record state funding for housing two years in a row, and some unprecedented legislative proposals like land use reform, for example.
He said he has tried to achieve “some systemic change around housing, which apparently there’s less appetite for than I had hoped.”
“That’s my main disappointment from the legislative session — and also sometimes the governor’s perspective on this stuff — it’s like everyone thinks in terms of projects, everyone wants to throw money at problems, but there isn’t as much appetite to try and fix these bigger structural issues that are making our dollars not go as far,” he said.
Considering all of the different changes needed, it will take a decade to reverse New Mexico’s affordable housing situation, Werwath said.
“I shot my shot at trying to get the state to embrace a systems-level approach to housing,” he said. “I felt like we had a lot of really good bipartisan support. I’m disappointed. I don’t think the state is as serious about solving housing as it says it is.”
There are still three people at the governor’s office still working on housing, Werwath said.
He said he will probably return to work as a housing planning consultant, but for now he needs a break to prepare for his child to be born next month.
“I’ve been definitely not giving enough time to my family over the last 14 months, so that’s my top priority right now,” he said.

Incoming owners of the Holland Lake Lodge are awaiting approval to operate the historic 101-year-old property under a special-use permit from the Flathead National Forest.
In an announcement this week, the Flathead National Forest requested public input on the proposed permit, which would allow Eric Jacobsen and Thomas Knowles, as Holland Peak LLC, to operate the lodge each year from June through October with its existing footprint.
Forest Supervisor Anthony Botello said in a Forest Service scoping letter that he is proposing to authorize a 20-year special-use permit for the lodge, a private business operating on public land.
The proposed permit includes offering guest accommodations, dining and beverage services, including liquor sale, merchandise sales, hosting special events, and offering canoe and kayak rentals. Staffing would include a full-time lodge manager, a full-time maintenance manager, and food and beverage manager.
“There is no proposed expansion of Holland Lake Lodge with this proposal, and only minor maintenance of existing facilities is proposed focused on public and employee safety,” according to the scoping letter.
The application will undergo an environmental analysis, which is required by the National Environmental Policy Act, and includes a public comment period.
Holland Lake Lodge has been under public scrutiny for several years after the public learned that longtime owner Christian Wohlfeil was proposing a sale to outdoor adventure company POWDR and an accompanying expansion plan to build an additional lodge and 26 cabin structures on the property.
The plan drew public outcry for it’s rushed timeframe and a determination that the expansion did not need an environmental analysis.  The Forest Service received more than 6,000 submitted comments from individuals, elected officials and conservation groups. The Forest Service later rejected the plan, but said it would consider other proposals.
Wohlfeil listed the property for sale in October of 2023. Late last year, Jacobsen, a private equity investor, announced he had secured a contract to purchase the lodge.
Jacobsen grew up in Montana and now splits his time between Whitefish and Park City, Utah. He has stated in public meetings held prior to the purchase agreement that his intention is to “Preserve and protect the lodge and the lodge experience in harmony with nature into the future” and not develop the property.
In the months prior to entering into the contract, Jacobsen held a series of meetings with community stakeholders to assess their vision for the property and share his own. The meetings received a mixed reception from locals and visitors who want to see the property preserved as-is, but also understood the need for investment to keep it operational.
One grassroots group that formed to advocate for the preservation of the Lodge and surrounding area, Stewards of the Swan Valley, even proposed acquiring the lodge on its own and taking a “home-grown” approach to running the lodge.
In a press release sent Wednesday, Stewards of the Swan Valley President Grace Siloti and Vice President Fred Clark said they plan to “ask the tough questions” to determine what Jacobsen and Knowles will do with the property and make sure the lodge and surrounding area is adequately protected.
“Any new business there should be respectful of our land, the clean air and water, wildlife and open spaces that make Montana so special. The previous attempt to triple the size of the lodge and create a destination resort at Holland Lake met strong public opposition,” they said in a joint statement. “The public has spoken, and will again, and wants to ensure our access to this public land and keep it safe from overdevelopment.”
If the Forest Service grants the new permit, it is unclear just how much of the property would be operational this year.
In 2024, the lodge’s 100th anniversary year, there were no public services provided due to deficiencies in the wastewater treatment system, which serves both the lodge facilities and nearby campground. However, the Flathead National Forest has submitted a preliminary report for upgrades to the Department of Environmental Quality.
Due to the public outcry over the previously submitted expansion plan, Botello wrote in the scoping letter that while the new permit would be excluded from documentation in an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment — due to the new permit merely replacing the existing one under new owners — he plans to document all steps of the decision.
“Holland Lake Lodge has provided a unique recreation opportunity for national forest visitors for one hundred years,” Botello said in a statement. “The resort has served as a destination for forest visitors to enjoy the Flathead National Forest and I look forward to working with the new owners and community to continue this opportunity into the future.”
The Flathead National Forest will host a community meeting on April 17 to provide information and answer questions about reissuing the permit for Holland Lake Lodge. The meeting will take place form 5:30-7:30 p.m. at Swan Valley Elementary School near Condon.
Public comments are now being accepted and can be submitted until 11:59 p.m., on May 7, 2025.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regulators refused Thursday to pause proceedings on a carbon capture pipeline permit, instead directing Summit Carbon Solutions to present a plan during the next meeting illustrating how the company can move forward — or not — under a new state law barring its use of eminent domain.
The Public Utilities Commission, meeting in Pierre, voted 3-0 to deny Summit’s request to put its application on hold.
“What’s the plan here? And that’s the question that’s rolling around in my mind,” said Commissioner Chris Nelson.
The proposed $9 billion pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota. The project is part of a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Summit has been seeking a permit to build a portion of the pipeline through South Dakota since 2022. But its path forward was complicated by the Legislature’s passage of the eminent domain ban in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
“If they can’t even build it, what are we doing here?” said attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project.

Nelson moved for the permit to be denied, arguing that the proposed route cannot be legally constructed under the new law and citing declarations from dozens of landowners refusing access. His motion failed 2-1, with the other commissioners saying Summit should be given more time.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke said the company needs more time to evaluate its options, but declined when pressed by Nelson to say whether Summit plans to challenge the eminent domain ban in court.
The commission plans to consider the matter again at its April 22 meeting.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia senators on Thursday walked back a “possum” attempt to get religious exemptions for the state’s strict school immunization requirements into state code after the legislation failed to pass in the House.
Senate Health Committee Chairwoman Laura Wakim Chapman, R-Ohio, withdrew a committee amendment to House Bill 2776 that would have incorporated a version of Senate Bill 460, allowing religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements and revising the existing medical exemption process. 
In a speech from the Senate floor Thursday evening, Chapman attributed withdrawing the amendment to “Big Pharma” and “Big Medicine” not wanting the policy and killing it.
“Make no mistake, Big Pharma and Big Medicine aren’t influencing our policies. They are buying them,” she said. “They’re buying them through radio ads, newspaper ads and TV ads. They’re buying them by spending millions to get their candidates elected.”
The Senate passed House Bill 2776, requiring the state Bureau for Public Health to report positive cases of the tick-borne condition Alpha-gal syndrome, to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, without the vaccine amendment.  
The Senate Health Committee added the vaccine exemption amendment Monday over objections from Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, that the addition of vaccine exemptions was not germane to the bill. 
Garcia on Monday called the committee’s amendment a “possum,” a reference to inserting inactive bills into active bills late in the 60-day session.
Chapman told West Virginia MetroNews she felt so strongly that families should be able to opt out of the requirements that she thought the policy deserved another shot at passing. 
She defended the vaccine exemption legislation Thursday evening, saying that if it had become law, it would have allowed meaningful medical exemptions and a “very tight religious exemption,” as 45 others states allow.
Chapman also defended inserting the language of the bill into the Alpha-gal legislation, saying that before doing so she checked with the Senate parliamentarian to see if the bill was germane. 
“Make no mistake, this issue is not going away, and I’m not going to give up,” Chapman said. “There are more like me in the Legislature who are not going to give up on this issue. 
“We want our children to receive an education. We want religious liberty, and we want our young families to remain in the greatest state of the nation,” she said. “We fight for the children of West Virginia, not big health care’s bottom line. Let it be known to the people of West Virginia that there are good people fighting for you, every day.”
The Senate this year signed off on Senate Bill 460, but the House of Delegates rejected the legislation with a 42 to 56 vote.
All states require students to be vaccinated for a series of infectious diseases including measles, polio and chickenpox. 
Until this year, West Virginia was among five states that did not allow exemptions to those requirements based on religious or philosophical beliefs. The state’s laws have only allowed medical exemptions, which have required the approval of the state’s immunization officer. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. Despite the House voting down the legislation, the state Department of Health has said it will continue to abide by the governor’s order. 
The regular session ends Saturday at midnight.

Treasurer Curtis Loftis is seen before a House Ways and Means subcommittee meeting in Columbia, S.C. on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. (Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s treasurer is petitioning the state Supreme Court to halt efforts to remove him from office.
Treasurer Curtis Loftis filed the petition seeking an injunction Thursday, about a week and a half before the Senate is set to weigh whether Loftis “willfully neglected his duties” for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error that went unreported for nearly a decade.
The court filing comes after senators initiated an obscure constitutional process known as “removal on address.”
“This injunction is about ensuring fairness, transparency, and adherence to the rule of law,” Loftis said in a statement. “I am asking the Supreme Court to step in and clarify whether the Senate is authorized to overturn a state election using this provision. The people of South Carolina deserve a process that upholds the law and the democratic principles they have entrusted to us.”
As an elected official, Loftis can’t simply be fired.
Instead, the Senate has invoked this procedure, which has a lower bar than impeachment and applies when an official commits willful neglect of duty rather than a serious crime.
In his statement, the treasurer criticized the procedures for the hearing, scheduled for April 21, for not allowing witnesses to be called, not allowing objections to be made and not requiring a quorum of members to be present.
Under the process, the governor must remove an executive officer from office if two-thirds of both chambers of the Legislature vote to remove him.
But it’s unclear what the House will do — if anything.
While some GOP House members have called the situation both frustrating and troubling, none have called for his removal. Only Democrat Rep. Heather Bauer of Columbia has introduced legislation calling on the House to start impeachment proceedings.
Amid the mess, Loftis told senators during a public hearing last April that he would not seek re-election in 2026. But he reversed course last week. Exactly one year after he pledged not to run, he said he’d changed his mind and will seek a fifth term to the post he first won in 2010.
The error
South Carolina’s accounting problems, which involved almost no actual money, came to light in 2022.
It started with a larger, $3.5 billion error included in annual reports given to Wall Street investors that double counted funds sent to the state’s public universities. That ultimately led to the 2023 resignation of Republican Richard Eckstrom, who had been the comptroller general — the state’s chief accountant — for 20 years.
Then, a panel of Senate investigators assigned to look into the matter turned their attention to the treasurer’s office.
During the changeover from the state’s legacy accounting system to a new one, a series of electronic ledger entries made it appear the state had $1.8 billion sitting untouched in a fund with no record of where it was supposed to go. The state’s financial officials never alerted the General Assembly to the issue.
But the entries were made in error, and all but $200 million of the money was never real, according to a forensic accounting firm hired by the state.
In the wake of the blunder, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has launched its own investigation into the matter. The state could face penalties ranging from a hit to its sterling credit rating to hefty fines, depending on how severely the federal investigators view the issue.
‘Not unexpected’
Loftis has maintained he did nothing wrong, pointing the finger instead at other financial officers and even the senators conducting the investigation.
State Auditor George Kennedy tendered his resignation in January. But Loftis has remained defiant against calls for his own resignation.
Sen. Larry Grooms said Loftis’ petition to the Supreme Court came as no surprise.
“It’s not unexpected,” the Bonneau Beach Republican said. “But I don’t expect the court to tell the Senate it can’t conduct a hearing that is prescribed in the state constitution.”
In his petition, Loftis argues that constitutional section applies only to “state officers elected by the General Assembly” and “has certainly never been applied to statewide elected officials.” The court documents cited a section of state code as evidence.
Senate President Thomas Alexander, who was named in the petition due to his leadership position, declined to comment on the pending litigation.

,Alaska Beacon,2025-04-10 23:00:13+00:00,Alaska Beacon,"On Alaska LNG Project, a lot of work must be done, but major progress has been made",Warren Christian,,,,,https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/04/10/on-alaska-lng-project-a-lot-of-work-must-be-done-but-major-progress-has-been-made/,"As the Alaskan who leads the board of the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation , I write to provide a frank update about the Alaska LNG Project, which has been in the news a lot lately — AGDC signed a deal with Glenfarne to take over the project, President Trump and our congressional delegation vocally support […]","This map shows this proposed route for the Alaska LNG pipeline. (Alaska LNG)As the Alaskan who leads the board of the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation , I write to provide a frank update about the Alaska LNG Project, which has been in the news a lot lately — AGDC signed a deal with Glenfarne to take over the project, President Trump and our congressional delegation vocally support Alaska LNG, and markets in Asia have increased interest in buying Alaska’s liquefied natural gas. 
Alaska LNG is a big, expensive and complex project. Many Alaskans don’t realize just how big. Alaska LNG’s latest cost estimate, at the end of 2023, is for $44 billion. In comparison, Alaska’s annual state budget is about $13 billion. 
Alaskans have been hearing about natural gas projects for decades because Alaska’s North Slope natural gas resource is simply too valuable to ignore. Thankfully Alaskans have never given up on trying new ways to solve the puzzle. So what is different about Alaska LNG now?
First, we have our major permits in hand. These permits represent more than a piece of paper. Permitting Alaska LNG took approximately five years and more than $100 million of engineering and environmental design. The State of Alaska largely bore the costs of this permitting work. Both President Trump and President Biden gave Alaska LNG an environmental stamp of approval. Because permitting is such an expensive process with uncertain outcomes, completed permits substantially derisk Alaska LNG. They include a definitive project development timeline. LNG buyers take us more seriously because of our permits and they helped give Glenfarne the confidence that Alaska LNG stands up to scrutiny.
Second, Alaskans face a major Cook Inlet energy shortfall. We may need to rely on imports temporarily until the pipeline opens, but Alaska LNG is the ONLY option that meets three vital energy criteria: quantity, affordability, and reliability. Renewables can help, but honest experts will tell you that there is no practical replacement for the energy foundation provided by natural gas and one won’t be available for decades. Locking into long-term imports means doubling our energy bills for perpetuity and forgoing substantial in-state economic growth.
Third, Alaska LNG has been determined to be economically viable. No additional feasibility studies are required for private investment. Wood Mackenzie found that Alaska LNG can deliver LNG to Asia at prices lower than competing U.S. Gulf Coast projects. They determined that the pipeline can be economically self-supporting, even when the added cost of the lateral to Fairbanks and various North Slope gas supply options are considered. Critics often question Alaska LNG’s upfront costs, higher than other projects due to the pipeline, but our ongoing running costs are a lot lower than other projects because of our short shipping distance to Asia, about 75% shorter than Gulf Coast projects. North Slope gas will be cheaper than other sources because it is stranded with no means to get it to market, and it avoids the rampant price volatility characteristic of Lower 48 natural gas.
Fourth, Alaska LNG benefits from robust federal support. Our congressional delegation authored legislation signed by President Biden that makes Alaska LNG eligible for approximately $30 billion in federal loan guarantees. These loan guarantees greatly reduce borrowing costs, back project debt with the full faith and credit of the United States, lower project risk, and make Alaska LNG even more competitive in global markets. President Trump has made Alaska LNG a centerpiece of his second term through his executive orders and a focus of the new National Energy Dominance Council to use the full force of the federal government, including defense, trade, and commerce tools, to support Glenfarne’s work to propel Alaska LNG forward.
I promised you straight talk about Alaska LNG and here is the basic truth: There is still a lot of work to be done, and it will not be easy. Success is not guaranteed. But that also does not mean that we can dismiss or discount the major progress that has been made. Alaska LNG is built on the shoulders of previous efforts that fell short and benefits from insights gained along the way. The state has made a substantial investment in Alaska LNG — hundreds of millions of dollars — and we have reached a point where Glenfarne, a qualified private developer, will bear the costs and the risks going forward. Although policy makers will have the option for Alaska to invest in the construction of Alaska LNG, there is no further obligation to the state, which is now positioned to realize the billions of dollars of energy security, economic, employment and environmental benefits this project holds without any further material investment.
And although AGDC has passed the baton of project development to Glenfarne, the work of AGDC board members representing the state and protecting Alaska stakeholders continues. This project holds the potential to blaze a new path of prosperity for generations of Alaskans and has brought us closer than any previous effort. We’re not yet at the finish line, but our work continues with energy and optimism. As your neighbors and fellow Alaskans, we carry your interests in every decision we make and promise to keep you updated about the important work ahead.

(Courtesy of Sam Bregman) Albuquerque’s top prosecutor Sam Bregman announced his candidacy for governor early Thursday, but said he will not step down from the Second Judicial District Attorney’s office during the campaign.
Bregman is the second candidate to vie for the Democratic nomination, which will be decided by voters in a June 2026 primary election. He faces Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the Interior and New Mexico delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, who announced in February her intention to be the state’s first Indigenous woman governor.
The Haaland campaign declined to say much on Bregman’s entry. A spokesperson noted Haaland has raised $3 million in donations since launching the campaign and said in a written statement: “Deb’s message of strength and leadership to address New Mexico’s challenges head-on is resonating with New Mexicans. We’re truly grateful for the resounding grassroots support she’s received across the state.”
Source NM spoke briefly to Bregman about his bid to be the next governor prior to his formal announcement Thursday in Las Vegas.
Even though primary elections are a little over a year away, Bregman, who, as DA, oversees prosecutions in Bernalillo County, said he could manage his day job while running for office.
“I’m sure of it because of the team I have in place; I’m sure of it because I have a leash on every day called the iPhone, which is a computer itself,” he said. “I’m the district attorney 24-7, 365 and I always will be, as long as I have this job — and I know I can do the job and run for governor.”
Prior to serving as DA, Bregman held a seat on the Albuquerque City Council from one term beginning in 1995. In 2023, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Bregman to the Second Judicial District District Attorney position. He subsequently ran and won the primary challenge for the seat in 2024, which marked the most expensive race in that election.
Bregman highlighted to Source his accomplishments thus far as DA, such as efficiently managing an office of 330 attorneys and prosecuting more than more than 300 murders, he said.
Bregman said that the state has to do more to recruit police officers in Albuquerque, pointing to the recent request for Lujan Grisham to deploy National Guard in a support role.
“My understanding is that they will not be carrying guns, they will not be armed, they will not be patrolling the streets,” he said of the national guard. “But that goes back to, we have to do a better job in recruiting and retaining police officers.”
Bregman departed significantly from Haaland on this issue of climate change. She told Source NM in a February interview: “We need to do everything we can to have a clean environment for children,” and said that includes addressing emissions. Bregman, in contrast, said he would “not propose any new things on climate change,” saying that the industry provides more than $1 billion in revenue for schools, and generates significant revenue for the state.
“Those people who want to shut down the oil and gas exploration, development, I don’t support that one bit,” Bregman said.
When it comes to immigration, Bregman said he stands by his previous comments criticizing the Trump administration’s proposals for mass removals — which have included sending a Maryland man to an El Salvador prison.
“This policy of scaring the hell out of everybody out there that they’re going to be deported is a chilling effect on crime, for example, I can tell you that firsthand,” he said, saying that undocumented witnesses and victims are unwilling to come forward for fear of deportation.
Local DA says immigrant crime victims are going silent amid deportation fears, letting abusers free

Bregman said the state’s next leader has to assume an adversarial stance against the federal government. He opened a two-minute long video with his campaign announcement with a voiceover censuring top Republicans, saying: “New Mexico is under attack by Elon Musk, his puppet Donald Trump and Republicans in Washington.”
“You’ve got to stand up and fight back,” he told Source NM, later saying that was not a criticism of Lujan Grisham.
In the ad, Bregman also lobbed criticism against Democrats in Washington D.C., whom he characterizes as “weak, ineffective and complicit,” along with the “radical left.”
In his interview with Source, Bregman said the stakes such as Republican’s proposed cuts to Medicaid — the jointly run state-federal health insurance program for the very poor — which would have disproportionate impacts on New Mexico, requires pushing back against the federal government “at every opportunity.”
“The chaos in Washington right now  is all the more reason why we need someone who is not only a fighter, but results-driven and I feel like I am,” Bregman said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Providence Mayor Brett Smiley unveiled the city’s plans to take back control of its public schools in a victorious-looking location: the basketball court at the Zuccolo Recreation Center on Federal Hill, where black and white championship banners adorned the walls.   
“We were given an assignment. Today, we are submitting our homework,” Smiley told reporters at the release event Thursday morning for the 63-page strategy outlining how the city wants to reclaim governance of its public schools, which have been under state control since 2019. 
“We were told to show how we’re ready. We’ve been working for well over a year to prepare to take our schools back. We know that we’re ready.”  
The city began preparing the plan, “Providence’s Plan for Our Schools: Building a Brighter Future,” in fall 2023. The city’s Return to Local Control Cabinet— a committee made up of school board members, City Council staff and Mayor’s Office staff — were charged with investigating how the city’s schools could transition back to local control.
With the cabinet’s blessing, city officials began gathering community feedback last summer, hoping the final plan would satisfy not only community members but also the concerns of Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who extended the takeover last year for up to three years to 2027.
Infante-Green has said the takeover could end a year earlier, by next summer, if local stakeholders adequately fulfill a number of conditions outlined in a Feb. 18 letter. Smiley — plus the Providence School Board and Providence City Council — want change sooner. They’d like to see state control cease by the end of this school year. 
“This report today is not meant to be an indictment of RIDE,” Smiley said, adding that the schools have made some progress under RIDE’s regime. The takeover was originally spurred by a 2019 Johns Hopkins University report, which found both the educational and structural qualities of Providence’s schools sorely lacking.
But, Smiley wrote in his introductory letter to the plan, “​​We are ready to build a thriving public school system so that this type of intervention never occurs again for our schools.”
More investment in school buildings, diversity among teachers
Smiley chose a recreation center to unveil the plan to highlight its call for rec centers to serve as sites for after-school programming like homework help and tutoring. In all, the report details eight major elements of a vision for how Providence schools will operate once local control resumes.
The eight elements include:

Enhance community engagement with families, including prioritizing staffing in district offices who can address parents’ and caregivers’ concerns.
Support learning by adhering to the Turnaround Action Plan, which has guided assessment of the takeover’s progress in terms of student outcomes and achievements. 
Retool the governance structure of schools and the district and place the superintendent on the mayor’s senior leadership team. 
Invest in school facilities, streamline the budget process, and reorganize more schools to serve students from pre-K through eighth grade, 
Strengthen professional development opportunities for educators 
Simplify purchasing and procurement of supplies easier for schools.
Integrate information technology between city and district.
Leverage the city’s Revolving Fund to subsidize modern school facilities.

The city would also like to implement a shared accountability model across the district. Among its stipulations are weakening seniority mandates to diversify the teacher workforce. The district’s “efforts to recruit and retain teachers whose backgrounds and cultures match that of students are compromised by seniority-based mandates for classroom assignments and layoffs,” the report reads.










We were given an assignment. Today, we are submitting our homework.


– Providence Mayor Brett Smiley


District administrators would also be held more accountable for their actions via additional evaluations, and individual school leaders would be granted more authority over staffing and budgets for their individual schools.
The commissioner now exercises control over the most crucial aspects of district governance, including budget and personnel. Once the schools are back under city control, Smiley said he promises “better services with less money.” 
“The Providence school department and city of Providence were integrated for generations, and separation only happened six years ago,” he told reporters. “So this reintegration allows for an opportunity for a higher level of service for less cost.”
But the report notes the city “remains committed to honoring the court settlement with RIDE” from November 2024 that put Providence (and its taxpayers) on the hook for $15 million in additional school funding, plus additional investments in at least the next two fiscal years.
“When PPSD [Providence Public School District] returns to local management, the District will be fully integrated in the City’s budget development process,” the plan reads. “The Mayor and the District will finalize a proposed budget together to be submitted for the Providence City Council’s budget hearing and approval process.”

Too little, too soon for commissioner
The next step, the report notes, is to work with RIDE to formalize and finalize a plan in concert with Infante-Green. The commissioner will then present that plan for review and approval to the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education in June.  
The K-12 council OKs Infante-Green’s recommendations, and the appointed body affirmed her decision to extend the takeover last year without much fuss. So far, Smiley’s plan is not something Infante-Green wants to bring before the council, she wrote in a letter to council members Thursday.
“While we appreciate the City’s acknowledgement of improvements made possible with the support of RIDE, this report is incomplete and lacks sufficient detail and substance that will facilitate a successful transition to local control,” Infante-Green wrote.   
“The report was created in a silo by City staff and meets neither the Council’s directions nor our collective expectations for a robust, collaborative plan that explains how local leaders will both sustain and continue the progress we have achieved,” the commissioner continued. 
Infante-Green wrote that RIDE and the district “were not engaged in the design of the City’s latest report,” and were only asked to provide feedback once, “after the report had already been crafted.” Several elements of the plan conflicted with state law, the commissioner argued, dubbing it “an incomplete plan.”
“Frankly, many questions around how the City will better support the operations, structures, and systems of PPSD for long-term success remain unanswered or were not fully addressed,” Infante-Green wrote, adding that she has “real concerns that the City may implement redundant, burdensome processes and practices of the past that the Johns Hopkins report said stifled progress in PPSD for more than 30 years.”










While we appreciate the City’s acknowledgement of improvements made possible with the support of RIDE, this report is incomplete and lacks sufficient detail and substance that will facilitate a successful transition to local control. 


– Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green


Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office, responded to the commissioner’s claims in a statement Thursday evening: “To be clear, this is the City’s report to outline the steps to successfully transition governance to local control and was drafted in response to RIDE’s specific feedback, concerns and areas of focus.” 
Estrella said that the report incorporated “significant feedback…from community conversations which members of the RIDE and PPSD attended.” He added that there was “a high-level briefing and an in-depth meeting” with both RIDE and the district, after which the city modified the plan to accommodate RIDE’s suggestions. 
Echoing the mayor and the report, Estrella said that the plan “is a step…but it is not the last step” in the city’s efforts to integrate systems and operations in the school district.
“The next step is to establish a comprehensive plan in collaboration with all stakeholders to be presented to the K-12 Council in June of this year,” Estrella wrote. “This comprehensive plan was requested well after the City embarked on this robust process over the last year.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regulators refused Thursday to pause proceedings on a carbon capture pipeline permit, instead directing Summit Carbon Solutions to present a plan during the next meeting illustrating how the company can move forward — or not — under a new state law barring its use of eminent domain.
The Public Utilities Commission, meeting in Pierre, voted 3-0 to deny Summit’s request to put its application on hold.
“What’s the plan here? And that’s the question that’s rolling around in my mind,” Commissioner Chris Nelson said.
Carbon pipeline company seeks pause in permitting schedule after SD adopts eminent domain ban

The proposed $9 billion pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where it could also be used to extract oil from old wells. The project is part of a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Summit has been seeking a permit from state regulators to build a portion of the pipeline through the state since 2022. But its path forward was complicated by the Legislature’s passage of the eminent domain ban in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
“If they can’t even build it, what are we doing here?” said attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project.
Nelson moved for the permit to be denied, arguing that the proposed route cannot be legally constructed under the new law and citing declarations from dozens of landowners refusing access. His motion failed 2-1, with the other commissioners saying Summit should be given more time.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke said the company needs more time to evaluate its options, but declined when pressed by Nelson to say whether Summit plans to challenge the eminent domain ban in court.
The commission plans to consider the matter again at its April 22 meeting.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project.

Schools had until March 2026 to spend remaining COVID relief money. The U.S. Department of Education cut those funds, amounting to about $200 million for California K-12 schools. 


The Trump administration overstepped its authority when it cut short pandemic relief grants for K-12 schools, a move that cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a lawsuit filed today by California and a dozen other states.
The suit, filed against the U.S. Department of Education in the Southern District of New York, is California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s 13th lawsuit against the Trump administration. 
“When the president breaks the law, we sue. It’s that simple,” Bonta said. “And he’s broken the law again, unfortunately, this time harming children in the process.”  
“Our students have congressionally appropriated funding coming their way post-pandemic to help with all the challenges,” Bonta added. “The funds had a rollout period of another year but (U.S. Secretary of Education Secretary Linda McMahon) cut them overnight, and she doesn’t have the authority to do that.”
The lawsuit stems from a March 28 letter McMahon sent to state education chiefs, saying that the government would no longer honor extensions of COVID relief grants. States can ask for new extensions for individual projects, but in general the government would no longer send out COVID-relief grant money.
“Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon wrote.
In California, schools would lose about $200 million, Bonta said.
Tutoring and mental health
During the pandemic, the federal government gave out almost $200 billion to K-12 schools to help students recover academically and emotionally from school closures related to COVID-19. Schools used the money for tablets, after-school programs, tutoring, summer school, mental health counseling and other initiatives. California schools received more than $13 billion through several rounds of grants.
Most of those grants expired last year, but the Biden administration extended the spending deadline until March 2026 for districts that needed it.  
Bonta’s lawsuit argues that McMahon’s order is illegal because the money was approved by Congress and the Trump administration doesn’t have a right to slash it. The suit is asking that the Department of Education reinstate the original deadline of March 2026 and give schools the money they were originally allotted.
The pandemic had a profound effect on schools, as thousands closed their campuses for at least a year and switched to remote learning. Low-income students in particular fell behind academically, as they often lacked reliable Wi-Fi service or a quiet place to study. Many students also experienced depression and anxiety if a parent lost a job, a relative died, or they simply couldn’t see their friends.
Although test scores, discipline rates and attendance have all improved since 2020, most schools still lag behind their pre-pandemic performance.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/061121_SummerSchool_AW_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Medical Psilocybin Act into law, making New Mexico the third state to decriminalize the psychadelic for medical purposes. (Photo provided by Rudick Law Group)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Medical Psilocybin Act into law this week, making New Mexico the third state in the U.S. to decriminalize so-called “magic mushrooms. But advocates say the program is still a few years away from fully operating.
Senate Bill 219 decriminalizes psilocybin, often referred to as magic mushrooms, for treatment of major treatment-resistant depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; substance use disorders; and end-of-life care. It also establishes a nine-member Medical Psilocybin Advisory Board, which the secretary of the Department of Health will fill with people knowledgeable about behavioral health and who are able to advocate for the needs of particular New Mexicans, including Native residents and veterans.
Once the board is in place, members will begin to establish rules for licensing providers and requirements for psilocybin producers. Victoria Cvitanovic, a New Mexico-based lawyer specializing in psychedelic law, spoke on behalf of the bill during the recent session and told Source NM she anticipates the secretary will announce the first several board appointments quickly.
“It’s anticipated that the first patients are going to receive their doses in March of 2028,” Cvitanovic said, however the timeline could be faster if the board is established and quickly begins their work, she added. “But we’ve seen in other states, these programs take more time to launch than you think. We have to develop a supply chain here within the state for the products. We have to identify these practitioners and identify the first patients.  So with the time that this is going to take, I think that 2027 deadline is about right to see this get started.”
Cvitanovic said New Mexico has benefitted from seeing how Oregon and Colorado launched their medical psilocybin programs in recent years. New Mexico is now the third state to legalize the psychedelic treatment, and the first to do so legislatively rather than by a ballot vote.
She noted that SB219 also includes a research fund that will allow state universities to expand research into the use of psilocybin for different conditions, and possibly what best strains of the mushroom produce the best product. 
“The University of New Mexico has historically been a powerhouse when it comes to the research of psychedelics in the United States. They’ve done a wonderful job laying out a medical basis for this treatment,” Cvitanovic said. “Agricultural research is growing around mycelium production in general, things like functional mushrooms and also psychedelic mushrooms. So agricultural universities, they are going to be a huge part of the way that the psychedelics movement grows around the country, and I would love to see New Mexico State be involved in that.”
The advisory board has the authority to add to the list of qualifying conditions, which Cvitanovic said will likely not happen right away, but could include anxiety conditions and other types of depression.
Another aspect of the bill includes an equity fund, which will help people pay for the cost of treatment if they are not able to afford the out-of-pocket expense. 
Cvitanovic said while the advisory board has not been established yet, now is still a good time for providers who might be interested in the treatment to make sure their practice is in good order, and for patients to start talking to providers if they are interested in seeking treatment.
“Psilocybin is a scientifically-based treatment for getting past some of these traumas and being able to move forward with a more productive life,” she said. “As part of this small community, we really want to see our neighbors and our friends have what’s best for them, and this is a huge part of that.”

(Photo by Hayes Photography/Getty Images)There is a lot happening in the nation’s capital and state capitals across the country. There is an executive department power movement underway that may ultimately affect what churches are able to do at the altar on the Sabbath, including their collection plate activities.
Churches tend to believe that their mission is purely spiritual; that is, helping people obtain eternal salvation by means of righteous living, together with devotion to specific doctrines of the denominational church.
Most churches subscribe to the idea that in order to maintain separation of church and state they must not involve themselves in political/governmental issues, or else they will be breaking the long tradition of the church in America and possibly even the constitutional law of the nation, the First Amendment of which says, “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.”
However, that worry among churches today does not seem to have been Jesus’ worry. The anti-civic engagement concerns of the church today have ensured that it falls well short of emulating the broad-reaching socio-economic teachings and activities of the historical Jesus.
The Jesus that most churches pay respect to today is a distinctly privatized and revisionist Jesus. Contemporary church denominations have forgotten that Jesus once was so seriously upset about unregulated consumer interest rates that he went to a very public place to participate in an act of civil disobedience — overturning the tables of the moneychangers in the temple.
He seriously upbraided violence as a means of pursuing both domestic and international relations, since he told Peter to put away his sword and told his followers to peacefully pay their taxes to the Roman occupier rather than go the way of violent insurrection like the Zealots of his time. Zealot activities soon enough resulted in the disappearance of Israel as a nation for the next 2,000 years.
Jesus himself supported public judicial affairs as a criminal judge having a rabbinical civic legal education. This he made clear when he presided in the case of the woman taken in adultery.
Perhaps one of the most important ways Jesus demonstrated how people and their religious denominations can and should advocate for how government should be run is by teaching them about the Ten Commandments, the original constitutional law of the twelve tribes of Moses. This he accomplished in the Sermon on the Mount as well as in his parables. The Ten Commandments today occupy a central point in religious scripture because scripture is intended to encompass secular wisdom as well as moral and spiritual wisdom. The Bible, at bottom, is a book of comprehensive history of a nation in an important era of time.
Theologians today distance themselves from those civic doctrines by presenting Jesus as a disengaged civic citizen, only really concerned about teaching kindness and personal repentance from sin. The original Mosaic laws that Jesus supported, however, presented a timeless, classical republican organizational and operational system of government designed to ensure socio-economic justice. Those 10 laws interpreted against the historical backdrop of Hebrew oppression in Egypt, have been used to undergirded democratic governments across the Western world ever since. The great monotheistic God schooled Moses and the Hebrews in a system of consensual government that the Hebrews had lost sight of during the 400 years they sojourned in Egypt. The heavenly teacher of the Israelites later called prophets like Ezekiel who passed on God’s view of the political reality across much of the world, “Are not my ways equal, are not your ways unequal?” (Ezekiel 18:29)
On the other hand, traditionally the liberal Judeo-Christian churches have not been bashful about engaging in the “social gospel.” That is, participating in lobbying activities relating to secular measures like Afro-American civil rights, the Vietnam War, women’s rights/welfare rights, education/children’s rights, and identity rights. Conservatives seem to have made a big splash today in the political realm, especially the evangelical wing of the church who support big business and smaller government. They lobby for returning prayer and the Ten Commandments to the public schools and keeping liberal curriculum out of the schools.
The MAGA movement has virtually anointed its own leader as a new American prophet of economic righteousness and religious righteousness, if not moral and ethical righteousness. In fact, there is nothing wrong with the churches of either liberal or conservative persuasion lobbying for their favorite way of secular social/economic/political life. The scripture abundantly supports this assertion. It can be done without enforcing an established religion across the land.
Churches today, unfortunately, are silent while egalitarian/consensual government is being radically overhauled by an extra-legal movement that is switching over the institutions of government from democratic republicanism to autocratic/oligarchic monarchy. The new system of government features a racially, religiously, economically, and politically discriminatory two class system of government, with an aristocratic class having special privileges overseeing a commoner class with many fewer privileges. This is happening outside of the specified process for changing the form of government by constitutional amendment, which requires much more than a thin margin of electoral consent, but rather a two-thirds margin in the Congress and a three-fourths margin among the states.
In sum, the Christian church was originally designed to be one of the important civic institutions of the nation, joined at the hip with secular agencies in the task of assuring a level of peace and justice based on the democratic doctrine of human equality in rights and responsibilities. It is time for the church to step up.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/church-and-state-1024x618.jpeg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

(Photo by USDA)A free, online tool that helps farmers evaluate cover crop species based on things like county, production goals and drainage situation has been updated to reflect new research in the field. 
Iowa’s data for the Midwest Cover Crops Council cover crop decision tool, which was last revised in 2019, was updated to include 13 new cover crop species, more recent seeding dates that are accurate to county-level climate data and reviewed ratings of species for the area. 
Elizabeth Ripley, the conservation and cover crop outreach specialist with Iowa Learning Farms, said the tool not only recommends cover crop varieties to farmers, but also gives them a detailed sheet on potential challenges, seeding and termination requirements. 
“There’s a lot of information out there, and this is a great way to compare species directly, based on producer goals,” Ripley said. 
Ripley said the tool does not analyze cost, but said it can be a good way for farmers to learn about different species and start conversations with their local Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) office about cost share programs. 

Cover cropping is a sustainable agriculture practice of seeding between cash crops to keep roots and nutrients in the soil. Depending on variety, the crops can help to break up the soil, add nutrients like nitrogen, or even serve as grazing material for livestock.

Farmers will often use programs like the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, program to offset some of the costs of adding a cover crop to their operation. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship also incentivizes the practice with a program that reduces crop insurance premiums on cover cropped acres. 
According to an Iowa Nutrient Research & Education Council survey, nearly 4 million acres of corn and soybean cropland were planted with a cover crop in the 2023 crop year, which is more than double what was planted in 2017. 
Cover crops and reduced tillage practices are viewed as important elements in reducing nutrient runoff and soil loss from cropland.
The decision tool, hosted by Midwest Cover Crop Council, was updated with input from researchers, agency staff, seed dealers, farmers and other organizations.
Ripley said it was important to expand the list of cover crop species to make sure Iowa farmers had relevant research to consult when considering new seed mixtures. 
“Those were added in to be options, or at least to provide recommendations for folks that may be hearing about these different species from folks using them across the Midwest,” Ripley said. 
The 13 new varieties include: forage cabbage, sugarbeet, phacelia, lentil, chickling vetch, balansa clover, sweetclover, faba bean, proso millet, foxtail millet, Japanese millet, pearl millet, and spring triticale. 
Each variety also has county-specific seeding guidelines which were updated with the most recent 30-year climate normal. 
Ripley said staff from Iowa State University and the state NRCS office will be hosting a webinar in late April with more information on the update, which will be posted at Iowa Learning Farms.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota regulators refused Thursday to pause proceedings on a carbon capture pipeline permit, instead directing Summit Carbon Solutions to present a plan during the next meeting illustrating how the company can move forward — or not — under a new state law barring its use of eminent domain.
The Public Utilities Commission, meeting in Pierre, voted 3-0 to deny Summit’s request to put its application on hold.
“What’s the plan here? And that’s the question that’s rolling around in my mind,” said Commissioner Chris Nelson.
Carbon pipeline company seeks pause in permitting schedule after SD adopts eminent domain ban

The proposed $9 billion pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where some carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. The project is part of a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Summit has been seeking a permit to build a portion of the pipeline through South Dakota since 2022. But its path forward was complicated by the Legislature’s passage of the eminent domain ban in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
“If they can’t even build it, what are we doing here?” said attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project.
Nelson moved for the permit to be denied, arguing that the proposed route cannot be legally constructed under the new law and citing declarations from dozens of landowners refusing access. His motion failed 2-1, with the other commissioners saying Summit should be given more time.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke said the company needs more time to evaluate its options, but declined when pressed by Nelson to say whether Summit plans to challenge the eminent domain ban in court. 
The commission plans to consider the matter again at its April 22 meeting.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project.

A bill that would withdraw citizens’ ability to lodge anonymous complaints against law enforcement officers sparked sharp disagreement between department leaders and rank-and-file officers before a House committee Thursday in Tallahassee.
The bill (HB 317), sponsored by Miami-Dade Republican Tom Fabricio, is supported by groups representing law enforcement officers, such as the Fraternal Order of Police. But two of the most powerful lobbyist organizations in Tallahassee — the Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association — are firmly opposed.
Fabricio told members of the House Government Operations Subcommittee that his bill would not totally prohibit anonymous complaints. “What the bill says specifically is [that] before an interrogation of a police officer, the signed, sworn complaint must be given to them,” he said, emphasizing the distinction.
The House bill analysis, however, says that requiring any complaint against a law enforcement or corrections officer “be made in writing and signed under oath” in effect would be “prohibiting a person from making an anonymous complaint.”
That certainly is how the Florida Police Chiefs Association interprets the legislation. Both Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell, speaking for the chiefs, and Jennifer “Cookie” Pritt, executive director of their association, testified about why they oppose the legislation.
“It severely damages all of the progress that our profession has made with regard to transparency and accountability,” Revell said, adding that requiring a complainant to swear under oath “will effectively eliminate the vast majority of complaints and our communities’ confidence in us as the police to police ourselves.”
Pritt offered a dramatic presentation to the committee, speaking for nearly 10 minutes about how as a young police officer she was touched inappropriately and groped in a sexual way by a high-ranking command officer. She immediately reported the incident to her supervisor, who told her she shouldn’t discuss it with other officers.
That supervisor never reported the incident up the chain of command. Ultimately, the commanding officer received “some sort of remedial training on sexual harassment. He didn’t lose his job. He didn’t get demoted.”
Pritt said the point of her narrative was that she learned years later that she was not the only woman who had reported inappropriate behavior by this commander. “If you pass this bill, if anyone of these women had come forward and wished to remain anonymous, the agency I worked for then would not have been able to investigate these allegations,” she said.
“Backing the blue is about supporting the law enforcement profession, by not undermining the process by which we can hold accountable those who would tarnish the badge,” she added.
Buzz in the room
At one point during her testimony, law enforcement officials in the committee room who supported the legislation huddled among themselves, seemingly realizing how compelling Pritt’s testimony was. But it didn’t stop them from saying that the committee should vote for the proposal.
“I’m in support of the bill as written,” said James Baiardi, president of the Corrections Chapter of the Florida Police Benevolent Association.
“There’s a game out there. When correction officers are doing a good job you make a bunch of complaints against them. You get pulled off of the institution. He’s embarrassed in front of his peers that something’s wrong. If you want to make a complaint against somebody, and if you’re not lying to me, you don’t have a problem putting your name on it.”
“A lot like frivolous lawsuits there are also frivolous complaints in the criminal justice process,” added Lisa Henning, legislative liaison with the Florida State Fraternal Order of Police.
Every lawmaker on the committee who commented praised Pritt, who said it was only the second time she had publicly discussed the incident. Some said her testimony changed their minds.
“My heart broke,” said Hillsborough Republican Rep. Susan Valdés.
“I see the intention of what you’re trying to do,” Valdés told Rep. Fabricio. “And I don’t know if I can support it after hearing the testimony that we heard today.”
“I came in here as a yes vote,” added Broward County Democrat Darryl Campbell. “But after hearing those stories and realizing what is happening through their lens, I can’t vote up on this bill.”
‘Wrestling’ with scheduling the bill
Others were less sympathetic.
“If there’s some management issues in different precincts, that gets addressed,” said Miami Beach Republican Fabián Basabe.
“But we have to appreciate the fact that — and I also am curious why they’re not here? Maybe just because it’s not impactful enough to just grandstand their experiences, or maybe they just don’t want to go through it again or just revisit it. There are countless numbers of false claims that have ruined lives in law enforcement.”
The bill was approved 11-6, with Valdés and Pinellas County’s Linda Chaney the only Republicans to oppose the measure. Osceola County Democrat Jose Alvarez was the only Democrat to support the bill.
“I’ve been wrestling with putting this on the agenda for a very long time,” said Chaney, who chairs the committee that heard the bill.
Following the vote, Fabricio told the Phoenix that despite the criticism by members of the Police Chiefs Association, the bill still allows people to make anonymous complaints.
The measure has one more stop, in the Judiciary Committee, before hitting the floor of the House. Its Senate companion (SB 516), sponsored by Hillsborough County Republican Jay Collins, has yet to be heard in any committee.

Wikler speaks at a climate rally outside of Sen. Ron Johnson's Madison office on June 8, 2021. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler, who is credited for rebuilding the state party over the last six years, announced Thursday that he will not run for another term in the leadership position, saying it is time for him to “pass the torch” and find a new way to contribute to the “fight.”
The announcement comes a little over a week after a crucial Wisconsin Supreme Court election where the party’s preferred candidate, Justice-elect Susan Crawford, prevailed over Waukesha Judge Brad Schimel, who had the backing of Republicans and billionaire Elon Musk. 
Wikler said that the party is in “extraordinarily strong shape” with a liberal majority on the state Supreme Court for at least the next two years and Democrats in the position to potentially win a both houses of the Legislature and retain the governor’s office in 2026. 
“Now is the right time for me to take a breath, and to find new ways to advance the fight for a country that works for working people, and one that honors every person’s fundamental freedom and dignity,” Wikler wrote in a letter. “When my third term as chair ends this June, I will be passing the torch.” 
Wikler said he would be taking some time to “figure out what’s next” and to spend time with his family. 
The prospect of Wikler stepping down was broached earlier this year as he ran for Democratic National Committee chair. But he lost the race to Ken Martin, who was serving at the time as the Minnesota DFL Party chair. 
Wikler, who grew up in Wisconsin, moved back to the state in 2018 and started volunteering on campaigns. He was elected to be chair in 2019 in a moment where Democrats hadn’t had consistent success in the state for many years, but had just elected Gov. Tony Evers, putting a Democrat in the governor’s mansion for the first time in eight years.
Under his leadership, Democrats reelected Evers in 2022 by a bigger margin of votes than his first term, clawed back seats in the state Legislature under new legislative maps and flipped control of the state Supreme Court. 
In his letter, Wikler noted that the statewide races the Democrats have lost have been “agonizingly close.” This includes former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes’ loss by one percentage point to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2022 and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss in Wisconsin by less than 30,000 votes  to President Donald Trump last year.
Wikler also helped grow the state party’s fundraising efforts during his time at the helm, including raising more than $63 million during the 2024 election cycle — the most of any state party across the country. 
“This is a wrenching time for our country,” Wikler wrote in his announcement. “But in Wisconsin’s path over the last 15 years, we can see what we need to do to fight through it. It’s on all of us to find ways to contain the damage, look out for one another, and build the strength to end the destruction — and then rebuild. I’ll be looking for new ways to contribute to that vital work. As I do, I know the labor of building a great Democratic Party — the last line of defense of our battered but immeasurably valuable democracy — will continue. We will not let our country fall, and we will continue to write the story of Wisconsin’s resurrection as a bastion of progress.” 
Wisconsin Democrats acknowledged Wikler’s impact on the party after his announcement. 
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein said in a statement that “nobody could have dreamed about the lasting, meaningful infrastructure he would go on to build at WisDems.” 
“Through innovation, grit, and a ton of hard work, he transformed our State Party into a national powerhouse – with the results to show for it,” Hesselbein said. 
During Wikler’s time in office, Wisconsin implemented new legislative maps that have given Democrats a chance to control the Senate and Assembly for the first time in 15 years. “While he won’t be at the helm in 2026 when we flip the Legislature, it will be because of Ben’s efforts that we are able to do so,” Hesselbein said.
New chair will be elected in June 
The next chair will be chosen at the state party’s convention in June in Wisconsin Dells and will lead the party through a number of crucial elections, including the 2026 gubernatorial election, another round of state legislative elections and another state Supreme Court race. Some Democrats are already throwing their hat into the ring or announcing that they’re considering a run. 
Devin Remiker, the former executive director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, quickly announced his campaign for the top position, saying that “now isn’t the time to hit pause or rebuild, it’s time to fight tooth and nail.” Remiker said in a statement that he is grateful for Wikler’s leadership and that he has learned from him and hopes to build on his legacy. 
“I will be ready on Day One to double down on our successes and make needed changes,” Remiker said. “I have the experience working with local party leaders and grassroots activists to provide the partnership they desperately need on the frontlines of this fight.”  
Remiker, a Two Rivers native, has worked for the state party since 2018, including as executive director and currently as a senior advisor. He previously managed western Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Ron Kind’s reelection campaign in 2016.
Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki, a Milwaukee native, said in a statement that in conversations about the party’s future he has heard that “Democrats have got to do better when it comes to how we communicate our message.” 
“We need more effective communicators, period. I’ve given long, serious thought to how we do that and up our game,” Zepecki said. He said he will spend the next week speaking with party members and leaders “about that vision to see if they’re ready to shake things up.” 
Zepecki founded his own company, Zepecki Communications, in 2016, and has worked on three presidential campaigns as well as statewide campaigns for governor and U.S. Senate.

Jared Polis signs Senate Bill 25-3, a gun safety measure, on April 10, 2025, at the Colorado Capitol. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday signed into law Senate Bill 25-3, which sets training requirements to purchase most semiautomatic firearms.
“I really think this bill will make Colorado communities safer and prevent accidents, as well as gun violence. Ultimately, that means saving lives while protecting our Second Amendment rights and upholding Colorado’s proud tradition of sports shooting and hunting,” he said during a bill signing ceremony in his office at the Capitol.
The policy could become one of the most impactful gun laws in the state in recent years, following the recent enactment of a ghost gun ban, gun purchase age restriction, three-day waiting period for purchases, and an expanded “red flag” law.
SB-3 was sponsored by Sen. Tom Sullivan of Centennial, Sen. Julie Gonzales of Denver, Rep. Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Rep. Meg Englewood of Englewood, all Democrats. It passed the Legislature with only Democrats in favor.

Beginning in August 2026, it will be illegal in Colorado to buy semiautomatic rifles, shotguns and gas-operated semiautomatic handguns that accept detachable magazines without certain safety training. If a person doesn’t get that training, they could buy those types of firearms with a permanently-fixed magazine that adheres to the state’s 15-round limit.
A permit-to-purchase program created by Colorado Parks and Wildlife would authorize a person to buy an otherwise restricted firearm. This is how it will work: A person will need to apply to their sheriff for a course eligibility card that will take into account a background check. Sheriffs would have the power to deny an eligibility card if the person cannot legally own a firearm or if they are determined to be a danger to themselves or others.
After a person gets that card, they can take a course approved by the sheriff’s office — either 12 hours if they don’t have a hunting license through the state or four hours if they already have that license. Once the person completes the course and passes a test, they will be allowed for five years to buy one of the guns considered under the bill.
“If you’re going to be purchasing these weapons, it should be your responsibility to make sure that you’re educated on how to safely use these weapons. I think that’s common sense,” Polis said.
The bill exempts about 40 popular hunting rifles, as well as antique firearms.
It would not ban possession, so people can retain guns they own before August 2026 that would otherwise be banned for purchase.
The bill also bans rapid-fire devices, which increase a gun’s firing rate.
Staunch Republican opposition
The signed bill reflects a compromise between sponsors and Polis. The original version would have banned detachable magazines outright, but the permit-to-purchase plan was amended into it on the Senate floor after negotiations with Polis.
The governor still has some reservations on the policy. He said he wants the Department of Natural Resources and CPW to work to keep the cost of training under $200 and potentially offer financial assistance for lower-income Coloradans. He also said he wants to find a way for some individuals, such as retired law enforcement and former military personnel, to not have to undergo “redundant training.”
Three states require training to purchase firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. California and Massachusetts require it for all guns, and Washington requires it for semiautomatic firearms.
The bill faced staunch opposition from Republicans and gun-rights groups in the state, who argued it creates a burden to a person exercising their Second Amendment rights. They worry about potential backlogs to register for a training course and a financial roadblock of fees to get certified.
Ian Escalante , the executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, told reporters after the bill signing that the group is “exploring all options,” including litigation and opposing the bill sponsors during the next election.
The Legislature is also considering bills to raise the minimum age to buy ammunition, make firearm thefts felonies and impose new security requirements for gun shows. The ammunition bill was passed by both chambers and sent to Polis on Tuesday.

The notification comes amid a national trend of university students facing abrupt changes to their citizenship status.
UI International Programs Dean and Associate Provost Russell Ganim emailed “international students and scholars” Thursday to inform them that the visa of a UI student was canceled. The university learned of this April 4, according to the email, and the UI International Student and Scholar Services reached out directly to the student with an offer to meet and describe next steps.
“The university did not initiate the action and was not aware of any violation,” Ganim said in his email.

Ganim did not identify the student in his email or provide information on their current situation. He said if the international services office learns of other students’ visas being changed or canceled, it will “reach out immediately to share guidance and outline next steps.”
The email also included resources for legal advice, which Ganim said the university cannot provide, including the Iowa State Bar Association, UI Student Legal Services and the Iowa Law law clinic. Students should check the federal updates page for international programs for additional information, Ganim said in the email, and reach out to international services if there are any questions or concerns.
“International students and scholars are valued members of the Iowa community,” Ganim said in the email.
Hundreds of international students across the U.S. are in similar situations, with universities from Texas to Oregon and Wisconsin, Ohio, Utah and more reporting changing immigrant statuses among their communities.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March the State Department had canceled visas of 300 international students, the Louisiana Illuminator reported, some of whom participated in pro-Palestine protests. The Department of Homeland Security announced this week it will start screening immigrants’ social media for “antisemitic activity” and the “physical harassment of Jewish individuals.”
“This will immediately affect aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity,” the release stated.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The mandate the Montana Legislature and governor put themselves under to address their constituents’ property tax concerns remains the same — find some relief.
A mix of policies, ideas, amendments and bills legislators say could fit together continue to be discussed in both chambers.
The property tax winds have shifted every week, and sometimes daily, but now just 19 legislative days remain, at most.
Gov. Greg Gianforte, who has previously put pressure on the Legislature to come up with tax relief, on Thursday again hammered on his concerns at a press conference.
“We can’t put property tax relief or income tax relief on ice this legislative session,” Gianforte said. “If legislators don’t deliver on meaningful, permanent income and property tax relief, they will be on thin ice with Montana voters.”
House Bill 231, known as the Homestead bill, is the governor’s preferred plan for property tax relief, and supported by his property tax task force.
HB 231 was taken off the table on Wednesday in the Senate Taxation Committee. It’s a bill from Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, and would shift some of the tax burden onto those who are not residents of the state, but own property in Montana. 
In a media availability this week, Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, said it would be a “disaster” for Billings and lead to a $7 million to $8 million hit on that city’s budget due to the way the city handles mills.
“(SB 231 is) just a non-starter for senators from that area,” McGillvray said Tuesday. “So there has to be some thoughtful negotiation around how we’re going to solve property tax, but I want to see some property tax reform, and I think there’s some competing options.”
HB 231 was introduced in late January, but has faced hurdles, both directly and indirectly.
A number of alternative property tax proposals — House Bill 528 from Rep. Ed Byrne, R-Bigfork, a recent major entry — have tried to balance what legislators have referred to as a “water bed,” or pushing down on one side, but seeing an unwanted increase on the other side.
Byrne’s bill seeks to drop agricultural and residential property taxes but it would likely increase taxes on industrial properties.
House Bill 155, sponsored by Rep. Mark Thane, D-Missoula, seeks a graduated tax rate for residential properties based on market value. House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan has called it the Democrat’s “go bill.”
Thane’s bill had a hearing in the Senate Taxation Committee last week, at the same time Byrne’s bill passed a second reading in the House. Both legislators said this week their bills aren’t directly competing with one another, but it’s unclear whether either will gain momentum.
Indirect alternatives to provide relief include tax credits and rebates, but Democrats, including Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, have said the rebates won’t be enough, and Sullivan echoed this on Tuesday.
“House Democrats put out a property tax rate bill first thing this session, and here we are, and we still don’t have a bill on the governor’s desk,” Sullivan said. “We have tried, and I think I’m pretty disappointed in the Republicans on a whole, that we still don’t have a way to at least create a solution to this.”
Senate Bill 90, brought by Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, to use money from tourists to offset bills for homeowners, has been a preferred plan by Senate leadership, but the bill ended up tabled in a House committee. 
Two bills from Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, SB 204 and 205 along, with SB 117 from Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, were cited by Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, as a suite of options last week. Also, a proposal to allocate $10 million of general fund dollars toward property tax relief is one component of the omnibus House Bill 924.
Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, has introduced two bills that are “last-ditch” options. One bill would put a two-year pause on property taxes, while another would offer homeowners rebates of up to $400 dollars. Both bills passed the Senate and are scheduled for hearings before a House committee.
Legislative leaders and the governor have acknowledged the shrinking timeline to get property tax relief passed, but continue to emphasize that it’s a top priority left for lawmakers to accomplish. 
Gianforte did expresses some optimism, saying “we are in the home stretch,” and said the Legislature is hard at work. 
“At the risk of sounding like a broken record,” Gianforte said, “Montanans’ income and property taxes are too high.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9663-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has advocated for his political allies to lead Florida universities. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate want to take some of that power away from him.
The House and Senate each have bills on their way to the floor limiting who can have a say in university and college presidential searches and selections.
Both bills would prohibit the State University System Board of Governors from having any say in universities’ choices for a president — currently a requirement — instead leaving it entirely to local stakeholders and the university’s trustees. 
Perhaps the biggest difference in the once-identical bills is that the House version (HB 1321) would eliminate secret searches and prevent the governor’s office from participating, while the Senate version (SB 1726) would not. 
“What we’re trying to do is, we’re trying to have the presidential search out in the sunshine,” House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters Wednesday. “The people should know what’s going on out there.”

The governor, meanwhile, has made clear his opposition, particularly to the House version, in another example of the divide between the executive and legislative GOP-controlled branches. 
DeSantis decried the legislation Wednesday evening in a solo video from his desk posted to X.
The governor said the bill would “undo” progress Florida has made in higher education and would “re-wokeify the universities, to throw a lifeline to the political Left.”
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
“Do not turn the reins over to unelected bureaucrats inside the universities. We need to have accountability and the people you elect to office need to be able to bring that accountability,” DeSantis said. 
“I do not understand where he is coming from,” Perez said of DeSantis’ video.
“If wokeism comes back to the university system it’s because the BOG approved it, it’s because the board of trustees approved it. By the way, both entities that are appointed by him,” Perez said. 
The governor’s office appoints six of 13 of the university trustees at each institution and 14 of the 17 members of the board of governors. 
DeSantis said during a news conference about condominiums in Miami Thursday that Floridians elected him to “make sure that these universities are in line.”
He asked if the House wants Floridians to “sit and take it” while universities hire “some flamboyant liberal president.”
House members agreed Tuesday to prohibit the executive branch or any public officer from lobbying for their preferred candidate to a university.
DeSantis has been deeply involved with recent searches, with Florida International University saying DeSantis reached out to advocate for former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez to be interim president.
 Last week, DeSantis acknowledged he tried to install now-U.S. Rep. Randy Fine (then a member of the Legislature) in the president’s office at Florida Atlantic University, and that his office guided former University of Florida President Ben Sasse to Gainesville, as Politico reported. 
The bills, sponsored by Sen. Alexis Calatayud and Rep. Michelle Salzman, would require a search committee to pick an interim president pending a permanent hire, or, hire an interim who already works at the institution.  Those provisions would have prevented Nuñez from taking her post at FIU.

‘De-politicizing the process’
The House bill is scheduled for a floor vote next Wednesday, while the Senate bill has one final committee to clear, Rules, after it unanimously passed the Senate Appropriations Committee on Higher Education Thursday. Neither bill has received a “no” vote in their combined four committee stops thus far. 
“The impact of your bill is we’re seeking to de-politicize the process of not only selecting appointees to the board of trustees, which is much needed, but also we are, in a way, de-politicizing the presidential search process,” Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith said Thursday. 
DeSantis installs allies at state universities in purge of ‘ideological concepts’

While the governor has made clear his concerns about the bill, the Legislature is asserting its authority to override his veto, doing so several times this calendar year.
The Senate bill would require presidential search committees to present at least three finalists to trustees for approval. In the instance of Sasse at UF, he was the lone finalist even though law requires a “shortlist” of finalists. 
Both bills would establish term limits for the Board of Education, Board of Governors, and university and college trustees and require that members would have to be alumni of the institution or residents of Florida. 
Existing law allows only one-year extensions of presidential terms (as set by the trustees) the bills would allow longer extensions.
Polling
Senators showed no particular interest in one provision in their chamber’s bill: That universities be prohibited from conducting polls about political candidates, although they would still be able to poll on topics. FAU and University of North Florida have well-established polling operations. 
“I’m not sure about the polling language that’s in here because, honestly, a lot of the best polling that we see on a lot of different races for public office here in Florida come from our higher education institutions,” Smith said.
 “And if they are not allowed to engage in this type of polling, which is done in a non-biased and nonpartisan way, by design you want them to be accurate. I feel like we may have a lack of information on polling that’s needed.”
Sen. Tom Leek voiced a similar concern, saying, “I really don’t understand the polling part, but we can talk about that offline.”

(Courtesy of the National Willa Cather Center)LINCOLN — A 27-room boutique hotel and events center, complete with a restaurant, spaces for readings and art classes and a two-story loft, is the latest addition to the historic structures enhancing Willa Cather’s hometown.
Last week, the opening of the Hotel Garber on Red Cloud’s Main Street was celebrated by the National Willa Cather Center and more than 100 guests.
The hotel, named after two prominent local residents that served as models for Cather’s work, is located in a renovated 1902 structure that had become an eyesore in the south-central Nebraska community.
It took more than eight years of planning and fund-raising to rebuild the former Potter-Wright building. The work, financed by $7 million in charitable gifts and grants and $1 million in Nebraska Historic Tax Credits, included replacing a third story that had been lost to a fire in 1961.
Many of the historic architectural details and ornamental features were replicated in the renovation, according to the Cather Center, including arched transoms with metal ornamentation above the third-story windows, cornices, pilasters and a brick parapet. The recessed front entry was restored, and original tin ceilings also were incorporated.
The hotel’s name refers to Silas and Lyra Garber, who served as models for the characters, Captain and Mrs. Forrester in Willa Cather’s 1923 novel “A Lost Lady.” Silas was a founder of Red Cloud and a two-term governor of Nebraska.
The hotel shares an elevator with the preserved Farmers and Merchants Bank next door, providing access to a new permanent exhibit about the history of Red Cloud, “Making a Place: A Long History of Red Cloud.” There also is access to a creative hub that provides space for readings, workshops, art classes and meetings.
Red Cloud is a Certified Creative District as designated by the Nebraska Arts Council and the home of the National Willa Cather Center, which hosts thousands of visitors from the U.S. and abroad each year.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unnamed-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

Sensors placed on William's head allow researchers to monitor spikes in his brain activity when he moves in his sleep. (Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)When a pregnant person receives an ultrasound, often the fetus inside the womb is seen moving in some way.
The youngest humans sleep the most, University of Iowa researcher Mark Blumberg said, but that sleep doesn’t look like an adult cat nap — it’s full of twitches and other movements.
For infants born prematurely, however, the environment in which they’re resting changes dramatically much sooner than normal, meaning much of their development is happening outside of the womb. This provides a powerful insight into the relationship between sleep and human development at its earliest stages, scientists say.
UI researchers are working with university hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) staff and families with infants in their care to log the sleep patterns of premature babies. The researchers are hoping to learn more about connections between sleep and development in early life and to use that knowledge to educate parents and ensure infants are getting the best sleep they can when they need it most.
“Being able to basically have these externalized fetuses that allow us to actually measure directly what they’re doing, we think we’re getting a very accurate assessment of what their sleep is like,” Blumberg said. “It’s not as comfortable or as quiet or as contained as what’s happening in the womb, but it’s our best chance to understand what sleep is like in premature infants.”

Blumberg, a UI professor and chair of the psychological and brain sciences department, is leading the five-year study, with $3.1 million in funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a branch of the National Institutes of Health.
Blumberg’s study of sleep extends back more than 20 years when he started looking at the sleep patterns, specifically unconscious twitching, and brain development of baby rats. Questions he and others sought to answer led from wondering why infants sleep so much when they’re young to why infants move so much while they sleep.
It turns out that twitching in sleep actually drives brain activity due to sensory input from the moving limb, he said. Around a decade ago, he began trying to understand sleep twitching and brain development in humans. He first worked with full-term infants before moving to premature infants.
Human babies cycle in and out of sleep quite often, Blumberg said, as often as every five to 15 minutes, and they can produce thousands of movements while in these periods of sleep. Researchers physically logged each facial and body movement made by the infants they studied while equipment monitored any spikes in brain function that occurred during twitches.
“There’s no AI for doing this yet, it’s a very complicated process to distinguish these movements,” Blumberg said. “We do it through actual human beings scoring these movements, and so it’s very, very time intensive and requires a lot of expertise.”
What they’ve found so far is that the most brain activity an infant has is when it is asleep and moving, Blumberg said, outpacing even the brain activity seen when the baby is awake. Full-body twitches are more common when infants are at their youngest, but finer movements in the fingers and toes show up later. The location and quantity of twitches also changes with age, he said, showing that the baby’s structure of sleep is changing.
The team is still learning about the movements and how they change, but Blumberg said he believes there are really exciting things to gain knowledge on in a number of areas if they keep watching.
“It’s just a black box, we don’t know what we’re going to find,” Blumberg said. “We have ideas, but we need to see them, and part of it is just really getting into the details of what’s going on with their breathing and their brain activity and their movements, and how all of those things link together.”
Lacey Kline, the mother of two prematurely born children and born early herself, enrolled her now toddler, William, in the study after he was born at just 23 weeks. He spent 135 days in the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics NICU, sometimes with a network of sensors on his head and researchers logging his every movement and twitch while sleeping.
The odds of survival for a baby born as early as William was have gotten a lot better than they were just 15 years ago, Kline said, largely due to medical advances made through scientific research.
“My thought is, you know, he likely would not have been here … if this would have been a long time ago,” Kline said. “So what can we do to help future babies?”
Publication and education
Researchers will conduct follow-up meetings this summer with the families they worked with more than two years ago, Blumberg said, in order to track their development over time and see if they have developed any disorders more commonly found in preterm infants. Gathering this data could lead to possible early detection of disorders based on sleep metrics.
In addition to follow-up meetings helping to drive research forward, UI researcher Greta Sokoloff said the team will also start compiling data together for its first paper and work with communities to educate about what sleep looks like in infants and its importance.
Sleep appears very different between infants and adults, Sokoloff said, and teaching parents about what to expect as normal from their sleeping baby and best practices will help assuage fears.
“I think there’s just a lot of lack of information, I guess, for people to really understand what sleep is supposed to look like in these kids,” Sokoloff said.
A movement to ensure sleep is undisturbed for newborn infants is already sweeping through European countries, Blumberg said — one he hopes will hop across the pond and make its way to the U.S.
In the past, Blumberg said neonatal care units were brightly lit and loud, creating an environment babies would have an incredibly hard time sleeping in. NICUs have improved over the years to be quieter and dim to disturb resting infants less, but he said more steps need to be taken to ensure babies’ development isn’t impacted by the need to monitor them.
“What they’re doing in Europe, and I have a close colleague in the Netherlands who’s doing this, is literally monitoring when the kids are awake and they’re asleep, and then making sure that they’re only disturbed when they’re awake,” Blumberg said. “These sorts of things, I think, are going to be super important for the future health of kids in NICUs.”
Researchers face uncertain funding future
Like many research teams across the U.S., Sokoloff said the group is currently waiting to hear back about the continuation of the NIH funding for the project’s fourth year. This is the correct time for the organization to get back to them, she added, but with federal changes and court challenges adding to an uncertain situation, she doesn’t know how much operations have slowed.
“We have good hopes that we, for sure, will get our continuation for our fourth year, but they could have to cut the budget,” Sokoloff said.
Blumberg shared Sokoloff’s hopes for the study’s continued funding, but said it’s “hard to focus some days” knowing that bad news could be headed his way. In his more than 30 years as a professor, Blumberg said he’s never seen anything like what’s going on at the federal level relating to necessary funding for important work.
Federal funding for multiple UI programs have already been cut or canceled entirely, including the International Writing Program, Iowa Flood Center and Iowa Geological Survey. Graduate students have also voiced concerns about funding cuts potentially leaving them without work.
There are “tremendous” amounts of fear and instability among the research community, Blumberg said, and to call people “terrified” is an undersell. He added that fear may be one of the goals behind all of the changes.
“I’m hopeful, but for the first time in my career, I’m fearful that things could be cut off in the middle,” Blumberg said. “And I know people who’ve had their grants canceled … It’s not just an unwarranted fear.”

In addition, the House Public Safety Committee, which rejected the measure, took the unusual step of signaling to their Senate colleagues that they will not consider similar plans for the rest of this session or during the next. A House leader said after the vote that “substantial changes” would first have to be made. 
Critics said the bill targeted tribal nations who haven’t yet agreed to compacts to provide tribal tag data. Supporters, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, said it’s unfair for Native residents to use turnpikes without paying like everyone else. 
Senate Bill 675, authored by Rep. Carl Newton, R-Cherokee, allows the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety to provide OTA with vehicle owner registration information available through the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunications System network. 
Rep. Danny Williams, R-Seminole, said tribes are diligently working with the state on compacts related to the turnpikes in “good faith,” and asked the committee to vote “do not pass” to get negotiations “back on track.” 
“Wouldn’t we be better off to allow the government-to-government solution where we have agreement, as opposed to us trying to force them to do things our way,” he said. 
The OTA has previously said that it has lost around $12.6 million in turnpike fees through its cashless tolling system because it lacks the vehicle registration information needed to bill some Native drivers with tribal tags.
Rep. Tim Turner, R-Kinta, questioned why the OTA should have access to this kind of data when Oklahoma’s law enforcement isn’t able to access it.
Officials said in 2024 that 27 of the 33 tribes that issue their own tags were sharing their information with the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, which facilitates a formal exchange of information like driving records and criminal histories between law enforcement agencies.

Stitt has continued to urge tribes to enter into compacts to ensure Indigenous residents are paying their fair share. Late last year, state and the Cherokee Nation leaders announced they had compacted, which allows the tribe to continue to issue its own license plates. The tribe will share driver information with law enforcement as well as the OTA so it can bill motorists.
“The turnpike should not be, the fee should not be based on race,” Stitt said. “It shouldn’t be raised based on where you live in the state. It shouldn’t be based on what tag you have on your car. Everybody that drives a turnpike should pay the same amount, right? … I think Oklahomans find that disgusting. I think Oklahomans find that ridiculous.”
The Republican governor has had previous conflicts with tribal nations in Oklahoma, including over tribal tag information and a recent disagreement over exclusivity on sports betting, if legalized, to the tribes. Stitt said the Muscogee (Creek) Nation “killed” the measure. 
Principal Chief David Hill of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation said the governor’s rhetoric was “divisive and ignorant” and called the bill’s fate a “win” in a Facebook post Thursday. 
“It’s not the first time we’ve heard this, trust me,” he said in a post. “ ‘Indians get everything for free! Indians don’t pay taxes! They get free college!’ And now, it seems the new one ‘The Creeks want to drive on the turnpikes for free!’ The same turnpikes that were built on our Reservations? That bear our names? That we were never consulted with during their concept or construction? Never mind that we receive zero percentage on the collection of tolls.”
He said thousands of tribal members and “an entire fleet of tribal vehicles” have a PikePass, a transponder within a vehicle attached to an individual’s account, to pay tolls online. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said while he agrees that everyone using turnpikes should pay tolls, he wants to find a solution by working collaboratively with tribes. He said Hill is a “good friend” and one of his constituents and hopes the state can work with the Muscogee (Creek) Nation on an agreement as it has with other tribal nations.

The measure easily cleared the Senate 39-6 with President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, one of the lawmakers voting in its favor. He said Thursday he doesn’t know what happened to the bill when it was sent to the opposite chamber or why the House committee rejected it, but wants to look into the decision more. 
Democratic House and Senate leadership said they were pleased that the measure had been halted. 
“I don’t know what our obsession is in this building with collecting people’s private information is, but we know that that bill specifically was targeting tribes,” said Minority Leader Cyndi Munson of Oklahoma City. 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, also of Oklahoma City, said the Oklahoma state government needs to respect tribal sovereignty. 
“We’ve made compacts with the tribes for their license plates, and we have to respect that process. And if that data is going to come, it should come directly from the tribe,” she said. “I think we’re seeing continual issues with the turnpike going totally to the cameras. And I think this is something we should have planned long before getting rid of the folks who were collecting those tolls on the roads.”

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois K-12 schools may soon be required to pick new mascots to replace those that reference Native American names and imagery.

That would include logos, team names and mascots which 90 schools throughout the state use, such as the Mt. Zion Braves or the Cahokia Comanches, according to legislators.

House Bill 1237 passed in the House on Thursday with a vote of 71-40.

The bill points out specific mascots and names like “Redskins, Braves, Chiefs, Chieftains, Tribe, Indians, or any synonymous term” as those being banned. It also applies to logos with Native American feathered headdresses or traditionally Native American weapons, especially if combined with feathers.

If signed into law, schools would have to have a new mascot chosen by July 1, 2026. Other big changes, that would cost schools money, have a slightly longer delay.

Instead of requiring schools to buy new athletic uniforms and other school materials with new iconography as soon as the bill passes, schools could keep using those old materials until Sept. 1, 2030, as long as the new names and logo designs have been picked out.

There is also an exception for any school whose mascot has a direct tie with a federally recognized tribe and the school gets permission from that tribe to continue using the mascot. That consent would have to be renewed every five years, according to the bill.

This isn’t the first year the bill’s main sponsor, Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, has tried to pass the Native mascot ban.

When West tried in 2020, members of the Native American Chamber of Commerce of Illinois asked him to push for teaching Native American history in schools first.

That education bill didn’t make it into law until 2023.

“This is about the welfare and benefit of our students. It's about not harming our students,” said Andrew Johnson, executive director of NACCI, during a March 20 committee hearing. “It's also not about polls, popularity, contests, anecdotes, tradition, honor, DEI, wokeness or political correctness.”

Advocates said they wanted to focus on K-12 schools because they can choose not to be fans of professional sports teams like the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL, but they can’t choose not to send their children to school.

This bill also does not apply to universities.

Educators and representatives said the bill would minimize children’s exposure in school to stereotypes about Native Americans.

“At one point, native mascots and logos were the most widespread education about native people in our state,” said Megan Bang, a professor at Northwestern University, during a committee hearing. “This year is our first time as a state to require teaching about native people.”

“The contradictions of both having educators teach about real Native people, but continue to perpetuate stereotyped images, sets up for educators to have harder times with young people, and sets in motion contradictory learning objectives for young people as well,” Bang said.

When the bill was discussed on the House floor, Republicans were united against the bill in their votes after they came back from an hour-long meeting they took during the bill’s debate.

“If there's bad actors, absolutely let's get rid of them. And I will also just leave you with this question,” Travis Weaver, R-Edwards, said. “This group of people were oppressed, but is oppressed and forgotten better?”




Aaron Golding, member of the Seneca Nation Beaver Clan and member of the Chicago American Indian Community Collaborative, said in March that Native Americans’ input and concerns are often dismissed.

“Our voices and expertise on these issues are ignored,” Golding said. “See, when people are taught about our history prior to 1900 only, without an understanding of our contemporary experiences over the most recent 125 years – and ‘recent’ is pretty loosely said there – it's easy to dismiss us as ghosts of the past whose needs don't matter today.”

The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s Worker Protection Act would repeal the Labor Peace Act’s requirement that workers in the state prevail in two elections to win union representation and collective bargaining. While the state Legislature is expected to pass the Worker Protection Act, Gov. Jared Polis has said that he will only sign it into law if it receives support from the business community.
That is unfortunate for several reasons.
To begin, the existing LPA makes Colorado akin to the 26 so-called right-to-work states, which ban union-security agreements that require workers to contribute to the cost of their representation. Scholars have estimated that, on average, RTW laws reduce union density by up to 13.5% in the public sector and 15.5% in the private sector.
Further, even when controlling for many different factors in comparison with non-union workers, union workers have been shown to enjoy greater wages and coverage by retirement plans and health insurance, and greater contributions toward that coverage from their employers. They also enjoy safer workplaces, and their presence even raises labor standards for all workers, union and non-union alike.

Union density in both the state and the country has declined ever since the early-to-mid-1950s, but the pace of that decline significantly accelerated in the 1970s and 80s. Unions in Colorado, and the U.S. as a whole, began to lose over half of all representation elections (“first elections”) in 1977, and this was a major mechanism by which employers reduced union density.
In addition, the trend line for union density in RTW states – which currently stands at 6.3% – has remained significantly lower than the trend line in the other states, where union density currently stands at 13%.
In Colorado, fewer victories in the first election means fewer chances to participate in the second election. Worse, unions in the state must win the second election by an even higher margin: a majority of all eligible voters or 75% of votes, whichever is greater.
This has had real impacts on working Coloradans. To survive without public benefits according to a nationally measured “Self-Sufficiency Standard,” Colorado parents with two children each need to work full-time at approximately $31.85 per hour. The median wage for unionized Coloradans is currently $32.90, but only 6.9% of Coloradans are unionized. The median wage for their non-unionized counterparts is $28.90, which translates to 27.4% of Colorado families who cannot pay their expenses without public benefits, and nearly 50% of American Indian/Alaska Native, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latinx Coloradans who cannot do so.
Polis should help to keep working Coloradans out of poverty, off public benefits, and able to freely choose in a single election whether they want to participate in a union.
From May to December 2024, the Service Employees International Union, Local 105, employed Jon Perkins to research and write the paper — “One Election Too Many: How the Colorado Labor Peace Act Impoverishes Workers” — on which this commentary is based.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho Governor's Office) Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law a budget bill his office describes as a record investment in Idaho’s foster care system. 
Joined by foster families and Idaho health officials in front of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s downtown Boise office on Wednesday, Little signed Senate Bill 1208. 
The bill will add 63 new child welfare staff in Health and Welfare and grow the agency’s youth safety division budget by nearly $23.2 million, a 20.5% increase.
Much of the initiatives funded will focus on preventing kids in need of child welfare services from entering foster homes — by providing resources to help them remain in their biological families. 
In foster care, Idaho Department Health and Welfare budget proposal focuses on prevention

“We all agree that children deserve to live carefree lives, free of abuse and neglect. We want Idaho children to grow up healthy, well-adjusted, safe. Yet Idaho has struggled to meet those needs of the most vulnerable child and those who live in their child welfare system,” Little said at the bill signing event.
Several watchdog reports by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations “have helped us understand the magnitude and that Idaho wasn’t doing enough,” the governor added. “That stops today.”
Officials also celebrated Idaho’s progress in improving its foster care system — pointing to the state’s reduced use of congregate care facilities, including the end of using short-term rentals like Airbnbs, to house kids in need of foster care. Officials reported they also drastically reduced the gap between the number of kids in need of foster care and the number of families willing to take them. 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams called the agency’s foster care outcome improvement focus a team effort that leaned on support from foster families, and nonprofit and community organizations. 
Little also nodded at President Donald Trump’s recent appointment of Adams to a federal health position. “Matter of fact, it’s such a good deal that Donald Trump’s stealing my guy away,” Little said.

 Idaho budget committee demands outcomes for new funds, employees. Top official is hopeful.

The new budget bill increases funding and allows new Idaho Department of Health and Welfare employees for the 2026 fiscal year, which starts in July. 
But the budget bill, set by the Idaho Legislature’s powerful budget committee, conditions some of the new staff and funds on the agency achieving at least an even number of foster families and foster kids by January 2026. 
If Health and Welfare doesn’t meet a 1:1 foster family to kid ratio by then, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, will evaluate removing eight of the new employees and $663,000 of the funds, the bill says.
Responding to questions from reporters, Adams said JFAC set a more modest goal than the department’s 1.5:1 ratio goal. “We want to be a state where families are waiting on kids, not kids waiting on families,” he said. 
Health and Welfare is just shy of hitting JFAC’s goal already, Adams said, as it has narrowed the ratio from 74 families per 100 kids a few months ago to 94 families per 100 kids now.
“We’re confident we’re going to hit (JFAC’s goal),” he said. “… We’re confident in this investment that it’s going to make a meaningful difference.”
 In prevention focus, Health and Welfare confident foster kids will stay safe

One of Health and Welfare’s goals in seeking the new foster care budget funds was to focus on boosting prevention resources. That’s in hopes of keeping more kids safely in their biological homes, rather than in foster care, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.
Asked about concern if some kids who need care won’t get it, Little replied “there will be some kids that don’t get through there. But we’re going to pick up so many more.”

Asked if the agency will have enough resources to avoid kids getting harmed amid the prevention focus, officials referenced resources that they hope will stabilize rough home situations. 
Out of the 63 new staffers the bill provides, 36 staff will be focused on prevention — growing the agency’s prevention team to 50 staff in total, Adams said. That team will oversee homes, connecting families to services like mental health and substance abuse treatment, he said. 
The early investments in prevention are key, Little said.
“This is where we’re putting money in early, putting it in and helping to stop that flow of these kids from a somewhat troubled past to a real troubled past. And it makes them productive citizens,” he said. “It’s a win-win situation with investment. And this is a very bold investment, so I’m proud of what we’ve done.”

After controversial sweeps in Kern County and a CalMatters investigation, the federal government will train agents on when they can stop and arrest people.


The Department of Homeland Security told a federal court it will retrain more than 900 California-based Border Patrol agents after controversial immigration sweeps in Kern County in January. 
The sweeps are the subject of a federal lawsuit against the agencies by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued that agents targeted people solely for looking Latino or like farmworkers, violating Fourth Amendment protections against arbitrary arrest. 
The leader of the Border Patrol’s El Centro sector, which conducted the raids, has maintained that his agents targeted specific people with criminal and deportation histories. 
But agents hit targets frequented by day laborers and farmworkers, such as Home Depot, a convenience store and routes to local orchards and farms. Witnesses said people were stopped indiscriminately and asked for their immigration papers. 
And a CalMatters investigation, based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection records, found that the agency had no criminal or immigration history on 77 of the 78 people arrested in what was called “Operation Return to Sender.” 
“Border Patrol does not admit to wrongdoing in the filing, but it’s also really striking that Border Patrol doesn’t defend its conduct in the filing,” said Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. “We know that their conduct was indefensible. The law doesn’t permit Border Patrol to assume that people are violating immigration law because they’re Brown.”
The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of the United Farm Workers and those detained. It asks a judge to issue an injunction to prevent the Border Patrol from any similar sweeps in California the future.
In court filings, DHS argued the court doesn’t have jurisdiction to review Border Patrol detentions — but also that the ACLU’s claims “have, in any event, been resolved” by new guidelines and training issued to its El Centro sector.  
“Accordingly, [Border Patrol]’s prompt, responsive, and demonstrated commitment to forestalling similar alleged violations in the future renders an injunction inappropriate, either as a matter of mootness or lack of a cognizable continued and future irreparable injury,” lawyers for the federal Office of Immigration Litigation wrote. 
The Central Valley immigration sweeps appeared to foreshadow the lengths federal agencies would go to fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to dramatically ramp up immigration enforcement in the United States.
A sworn declaration included with the DHS response, from senior Border Patrol official Sergio Guzman, said agents were issued updated legal guidance on April 4, 2025 prohibiting the El Centro Sector from making warrantless arrests unless they can show both probable cause that someone is in the United States in violation of immigration laws and that the person is likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained. Just being in the U.S. without authorization, the new guidance says, is no longer enough to justify such an arrest. Vehicle stops must be based on “specific, articulable facts,” and agents must document those reasons in formal immigration arrest records. 
The federal government said more than 900 agents in the El Centro sector will be trained on the new guidelines, including on how to write reports and how to comply with the Fourth Amendment. 
The court documents also say the new guidance is the same as guidelines to follow the law already issued by DHS. 
“The law has been the same all along, and in January, we saw that Border Patrol, which obviously should have known what this law is that has been on the books for decades requires, they didn’t and couldn’t follow it,” said Bernwanger. “We really don’t have any meaningful assurance that they’re going to follow the law now.” 
“It’s just a pinky swear” said Elizabeth Strater, national vice president at the United Farm Workers. “It’s a policy that could be withdrawn or changed at any time.”   
Whatever the outcome of the case, for many people detained or otherwise affected by the January raids, the damage has already been done. 
Wilder Munguia Esquivel, 38, a licensed handyman and longtime Bakersfield resident, said in an affidavit filed with the ACLU lawsuit that agents in masks and sunglasses yanked him from a group of day laborers outside a Home Depot. “My first thought was they might be terrorists mugging or kidnapping us. I even wondered if we could be murdered,” he stated. He said he still suffers pain in his arm from the encounter. 
Maria Guadalupe Hernandez Espinoza, a 46-year-old greenhouse worker with no criminal record, said in another affidavit that agents forcibly expelled her to Mexico under what they falsely labeled a “voluntary” departure. “My whole life was left in Bakersfield,” she said. “Everything I worked for is in Bakersfield.” 
U.S. citizen Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, a 44-year-old landscaper, said he was stopped by armed Border Patrol agents who slashed the tires of his work truck with a knife and refused to explain why he was being detained. “I believe the Border Patrol stopped me solely because of the color of my skin and my appearance,” he said in court filings. 
A hearing on the case is set for April 28 in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of California in Fresno.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/022525_Evident-Border-Trip_EM_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

Josh Shapiro holds a press conference at the Port of Philadelphia on April 10, 2025. (John Cole/Capital-Star)Gov. Josh Shapiro addressed three key issues facing the state and beyond on Thursday during an appearance in Philadelphia. Two tied into the state’s response to actions made by President Donald Trump’s administration: Tariffs and immigration. The third emphasized his support for funding increases for mass transit, as a potential budget fight looms. 
Shapiro steps up criticism of Trump’s tariffs
Shapiro, who has emerged as a consistent voice against Trump’s tariff policy, highlighted his concern about the impact on Pennsylvania consumers and businesses.
“I’ve heard from a lot of businesses that are wondering if they’re going to get their shipments or getting notice from suppliers that the materials or the products that they were counting on are no longer going to be able to come or going to cost a whole lot more,” Shapiro said.
“There is all kinds of confusion in the marketplace because of the confusion that Donald Trump has brought to this,” he added. “Certainly, we need more trade balance in the world and in this country. Certainly, we need to fix some of the bad trade deals of the past, but what the president has done here is injected chaos and increased prices on Pennsylvania consumers. That’s not the answer.”
Supporters of Trump’s tariffs believe that it will boost American manufacturing, although some economists are worried about rising costs for consumers.
Shapiro’s press conference on Thursday was at the Port of Philadelphia, which is the largest port in the U.S. for imported fruit. His office said the facility supports 12,000 jobs locally and 66,000 maritime jobs statewide, while saying Trump’s tariffs would hurt jobs there.

Mass transit agencies faces “dire situation” across Pennsylvania
On the same day SEPTA announced a proposal that would lead to significant service cuts, Shapiro is urging state lawmakers to approve legislation that would fund mass transit for agencies around the commonwealth.
“Let me just say, we face a dire situation for mass transit agencies all across Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh to Philly and rural communities in between,” Shapiro said Thursday.
Shapiro touted proposing “historic levels of funding for mass transit agencies,” for the last two budgets, while adding enough funding that has avoided service cuts to SEPTA. He also highlighted that the state House, with a narrow Democratic Party majority, passed a bill on a bipartisan basis to boost transportation funding of mass transit agencies on three occasions, but it has yet to advance  in the GOP-led Senate.
Since funding for mass transit has been at the forefront over the past year, Republicans have criticized Shapiro and Democrats on the issue, accusing them of prioritizing education over it.
“We heard earlier today from SEPTA that they can no longer wait,” Shapiro said.
In November, Shapiro transferred $153 million in federal highway capital funds to SEPTA to help stave off significant service cuts and fare increases. Republicans criticized that move, with state Rep. Martina White (R-Philadelphia) saying in November the highway system was already underfunded and described the action as “robbing Peter to pay Paul.”
Shapiro said on Thursday that “the time is now to act,” on mass transit funding and said House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) intends to bring up and pass legislation next month that would fund these systems statewide.
“We will all work together, as we have in the past, to find bipartisan agreement,” Shapiro said. “We’ve got to make sure we do so on mass transit this time.”

SEPTA isn’t the only transit system that has sounded the alarm over funding issues. Pittsburgh Regional Transit also announced last month that their agency is facing service reductions and fare increases.
“All 67 counties are impacted, and here in southeastern Pennsylvania, this is a crisis that needs to be addressed,” Shapiro said. 
 
Shapiro says Trump is “instilling fear” into immigrant communities across Pennsylvania
Shapiro criticized President Donald Trump’s policies with the southern border, while also saying the United States is in need of comprehensive immigration reform. He said he supports a secure border, a pathway to citizenship for those who have been living in the country, and establishing “clear rules of the road for folks who want to come here.”
“And you’ve got to come here legally if you want to be in this country,” Shapiro said.
“What the President is doing right now, in many ways, is instilling fear in too many of our immigrant communities across Pennsylvania, taking people who are otherwise legally permitted to be here and remov(ing) them without due process from their communities,” Shapiro said. “It is critically important that we follow the laws of the land, that individuals have due process rights, and that we also make clear that immigration into this country needs to be done legally.”
Shapiro added he believes all those things can be done at the same time and they are not mutually exclusive. 
“We can have due process, we can have compassion, we can have clear rules of the road. We can have a secure border. We need to do all of that,” Shapiro said. “What I’ve seen from this White House so far has been mostly haphazard and has not actually accomplished the test that I think most Americans think needs to be accomplished in D.C.”
On Wednesday evening, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA) said during a telephone townhall that he thinks a “showdown” was going to happen between the federal government and sanctuary cities in Pennsylvania.
According to the Center for Immigration Studies, there are 13 sanctuary cities and counties in Pennsylvania.

As Hunter dealt with the grief of losing her son Winston in May 2022, she relied on a victim’s advocate to help her figure out what she needed to do and where she needed to be, letting her know about important court dates and helping connect her with resources.

“I don’t think I would be where I’m at today if it wasn’t for them,” said Hunter, who lives in Woodford.
The types of services on which Hunter relied are in jeopardy as federal funding dries up for organizations dedicated to helping victims of crimes, advocates said during a rally Wednesday at the Statehouse.
Eight years ago, the state Attorney General’s Office received just over $50 million to distribute among organizations focused on helping victims of crimes, including survivors of domestic abuse and sexual assault.
By 2023, the latest grant cycle, that number was closer to $12 million, which they have four years to spend, according to federal spending data.
Organizations have turned to the state Legislature to make up some of the difference from the dwindling federal dollars.
Last year, legislators dedicated $5 million for grants to help victims’ advocates.
Attorney General Alan Wilson asked for $15 million this year.
That would be “enough to keep the doors open and keep the services going to the men and women who are providing invaluable services,” Wilson said.
But the House last month included just $3.5 million for crime victim assistance grants in its spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1.
Senators are poised to offer more. The budget proposal advanced to the Senate floor Wednesday by the Senate Finance Committee provides $7.5 million for those grants, which is still only half of Wilson’s request. The final budget passed by the Legislature could provide some amount between $3.5 million and $7.5 million.
The Department of Social Services, however, is set to receive the additional $1.2 million it requested in the coming fiscal year to help support 13 domestic violence shelters that meet the state’s qualifications. Both the House and Senate Finance Committee plans fund that request.
The bulk of federal grant funding for victims’ services comes from the Crime Victims Fund, which was created under a 1984 federal law.
Money for those grants comes from fines and penalties collected through convictions in federal cases. In 2021, then-President Joe Biden signed a law that added federal settlement agreements and other attorneys’ fees to the fund. That could eventually help bring the fund closer to previous highs, but it hasn’t yet made a major difference, advocates said.
In the meantime, some nonprofits, local law enforcement agencies and other organizations are left in the lurch as they search for other sources of funding, advocates said Wednesday.
“The last thing I want to see happen is one of these organizations close their doors that provide vital, vital services to the families and the victims who so desperately need them,” Wilson said.
The South Carolina Victim Assistance Network has had its federal funding cut about 45% since 2017.
The legal assistance program, which helps people understand their rights and the criminal process, has been unable to replace one attorney who retired and has had to ask others to work fewer hours because the organization can’t afford to pay for more hours, said Sarah Ford, the program’s director.
The organization’s caseload remains the same, with about a dozen new cases coming in each week. But the group doesn’t have the capacity to handle that many cases, Ford said.
“We’re definitely at the point where we’re not able to do all the things that we want to be doing for crime victims in South Carolina,” Ford said.
SC’s rape crisis centers get federal boost to assist survivors

Further cuts could be coming amid a broad freeze on federal grants under President Donald Trump’s administration.
Earlier this year, the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women removed all funding opportunities from its website, raising alarm as to whether groups will be able to receive other grants meant to help survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.
“The current instability around federal funding will significantly and negatively impact their ability to provide services to victims of violent crime,” said Shannon Nix, associate director for the South Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.
For people like Hunter, the services these organizations offer have been vital, she said.
Hunter’s son was killed after a drug dealer gave an incorrect address, leading four people to fire more than 20 bullets into her house.
Hunter’s advocates, who worked with the Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Department, helped her find and pay for a service to clean her living room, which was also the scene of the crime. They helped her find counseling and told her when court dates were coming up.

The Board of Economic Development’s decision will be carried out by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development through its Reinvestment Payment Program. The program makes payments up to the amount of sales and use taxes paid on project costs.
The office estimates that the companies will spend a combined total of $419 million on the projects and create a combined total of 180 full-time jobs.
“The growth we’re witnessing in South Dakota is a direct result of the dedication and hard work of businesses investing in our future,” said GOED Commissioner Joe Fiala in a news release. “We’re excited to see these projects move forward and contribute to our state’s success.”

According to the Renewable Thermal Collaborative, thermal energy storage is a term describing “various technologies that temporarily store energy by heating or cooling various storage mediums for later reuse. Sometimes called ‘heat batteries,’ TES technologies work to decouple the availability of heat generated from renewable electricity, solar thermal energy, or even recovered waste heat from when it is actively needed, helping decarbonize industrial processes and the heating or cooling of buildings.”

Ray Price, the president of Sunterra Farms Iowa, Sunwold Farms and Lariagra Farms, has filed a sworn affidavit in the federal civil case recently initiated by one of the companies’ lenders, Compeer Financial.
Compeer alleges that Price’s companies, which own and manage at least half a million swine in Iowa, South Dakota and elsewhere, have been involved in a check-kiting scheme that could cost lenders millions of dollars. At Compeer’s request, a federal judge recently appointed a receiver to take control of the companies’ assets and operations.
Recently, that receiver expressed concern to the court that she was being denied access to company information related to Canadian bank accounts, and that some financial information she needs might have been destroyed or manipulated once she attempted to gain access to it.
The three companies controlled by Price were given a deadline of April 9 to seek a protective order for the Canadian account information, and to assure the court that no data was destroyed or manipulated.
In court papers filed just before the Wednesday deadline, Price stated in a sworn affidavit that to his knowledge, no one has manipulated or destroyed the companies’ financial information.
At the same time, attorneys for Price’s companies told the court they and the receiver now “appear to have reached an agreement for the production of data from the Canadian entities that would resolve the issues which would require the filing of the motion for protective order.”
The court filings go on say “that data will be produced, with agreement and consent of the receiver, on Friday, April 11, 2025” – but adds that the parties still need to confer and determine whether “whether a protective order is necessary” to prevent disclosure.

The legislation would create a 10-mile buffer zone around the park — the Chaco Protection Zone —in which future leasing and development of oil, gas and minerals on non-Indian federal lands would be forbidden. The Biden administration began an administrative withdrawal of the area in 2023, which offered temporary protection. “That welcome step has been successful and is still in place but is under threat from the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress,” a news release from the delegation states. The legislation, on the other hand, would provide permanent protection.
“Chaco Culture National Historical Park — and the Greater Chaco Region — is one of the world’s greatest treasures that must be protected for our future generations,” U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) said in a statement. “Chaco holds deep spiritual and cultural significance for Tribes and Pueblos and is one of only a handful of World Heritage Sites in the United States. This legislation is a longstanding priority for Pueblo and Tribal communities, environmental advocates, and the New Mexico Delegation to ensure we protect our sacred sites.” Luján is leading the introduction of the bill in the U.S. Senate; U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández is doing so in the U.S. House.
The All Pueblo Council of Governors, which represents the 20 Pueblos of New Mexico and one in Texas, issued a statement reaffirming its support for the measure, with Pueblo of Acoma Gov.Charles Riley issuing a statement that: ““Chaco Canyon holds the footprints and fingerprints of our ancestors. By reintroducing legislation to permanently protect these federal lands, our congressional partners honor our living heritage, and the centuries of prayers offered to safeguard it. This is not only about preserving an archaeological wonder—it’s about ensuring our ancestral gifts remain intact for future generations.”
The Sierra Club Rio Grande chapter also endorsed the legislation:
“For years, advocates and impacted community members have called on federal agencies to protect the cultural integrity of the Greater Chaco landscape and community well-being from fracking,” Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter Program Manager Miya King-Flaherty said in a statement. “Now, under a second Trump administration that is blatantly calling for public lands to be sold off for corporate polluter interests and turn back the clock on climate action, it’s urgent that we permanently protect this sacred landscape from further desecration, as well as the health of communities already overburdened from oil and gas drilling. We’re thankful to Senator Ben Ray Lujan and Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez for continuing to pursue protecting Chaco Culture National Historical Park and hope efforts to protect the broader landscape and public health are not forgotten.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-646218190-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

A state-by-state report from Democrats last month projected up to 25 million across the country could lose access to Medicaid, a health program that covers medical costs for some low-income people as well as nursing home care, if Republicans successfully pass their proposed cuts to make room in the budget for a roughly $4.5 trillion tax cut extension.“This is personal to so many of us, and many of you are here from all over the country, Utah, Iowa, Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan,” Fair Share America Executive Director Kristen Crowell told the crowd. “This is a national movement where we are the people we’ve been waiting for.”Lawmakers “need to look us in the eye while they do harm,” Crowell said.Medicaid ‘was my lifeline’Cadon Sagendorf of Salt Lake City, Utah, told his story of relying on Medicaid while growing up in the foster care system. Foster youth are automatically eligible for the federally funded health care program administered by the states.“I was placed into the foster care system at birth and spent 10 days in the NICU withdrawing from meth, marijuana, heroin and cocaine. I was then later adopted seven months later, but at the age of 15, my adoption failed and I was placed back in the foster care system,” said Sagendorf, who is now 23 and studying psychology at the University of Utah.“Medicaid was not just a policy, it was my lifeline,” Sagendorf said.In most cases, foster youth who age out of the system at 18 can remain on Medicaid until age 26. Over 100,000 former foster youth received Medicaid in 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office.Mickey Rottinghaus, 70, of Center Point, Iowa, said she’s scared that her adult son Tucker could lose his Medicaid benefits if Congress follows through with deep spending cuts.The program pays for a nurse and home health aide to assist him every morning, seven days a week.Tucker, 50, was left paralyzed after being shot with a .22 caliber handgun at a friend’s apartment in 1994.“Our family was changed in a matter of moments,” Rottinghaus told the crowd.For three decades she’s been arranging his care, patching together a daily schedule of nurses paid for by Medicaid, supplementing with care paid for out of pocket and a circle of friends who volunteer to help.For the past two years, she’s been staying with her son in Waterloo, Iowa, to feed him in the afternoon and get him into bed at night.“I know that if he didn't have Medicaid, he wouldn't be able to have a nurse and a home health aide in the morning,” she told States Newsroom in an interview following her speech.The ‘hell, no’ CongressSeveral House and Senate Democrats spoke to the demonstrators, who wielded signs bearing the messages “Tax the Rich” and “Fair Taxes Now.”Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon borrowed a sign from the crowd that read “Dangerous Oligarchs Grab Everything,” referring to billionaire White House adviser Elon Musk’s DOGE cost-cutting agenda.“Well, I’ll tell ya, I’m a member of the ‘hell, no’ Congress. Are you a member?” he yelled to the crowd.“When Republicans say, ‘We are going to slash Medicaid,’ we say, ‘Hell no,’” he said, prompting the crowd to say it with him.Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia said “a budget is not just a fiscal document, it's a moral document.”

“Show me your budget and I'll show you who you think matters and who you think is dispensable. Show me your budget and I'll show you what you think about children, what you think about workers, what you think made America great. And if this budget that they are trying to pass were an EKG, it would suggest that the Congress has a heart problem and is in need of moral surgery,” Warnock said.On the hunt for spending cutsHouse and Senate Republican leaders announced Thursday they agreed to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade. GOP House lawmakers have been instructed to find $880 billion in cuts to programs under the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which holds jurisdiction over Medicaid, among other areas.The budget instructions that will guide the coming months of negotiations also direct the House Committee on Education and Workforce to find $330 billion in cuts, and the Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over government food programs, including SNAP, to find $230 billion in cuts.House Speaker Mike Johnson hailed the passage of the budget blueprint Thursday morning as “a big victory” and “a big day for us.”Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, maintains that letting the 2017 tax cuts expire would allow “the largest tax increase in U.S. history all at once.”“We have a responsibility to get our country back on a sound fiscal trajectory and also make sure that we ensure and protect those essential programs,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Senate on Thursday voted 19-13 in favor of legislation that requires immigration or citizenship documentation from the more than 900,000 students attending the state’s public schools. 
Senate bill 836 by Sen. Bo Watson, a Hixson Republican, would also give Tennessee public charter and K-12 schools the option of barring admission to students unable to provide proof they are legal residents — or charge them thousands of dollars in tuition.
If ultimately enacted, Tennessee would become the only state in the nation to deny students without legal status the right to a public school education, triggering a certain legal challenge. 
Texas, Indiana, Idaho and Ohio are weighing similar school exclusion policies, but Tennessee is the only state in which a bill is actively moving through its legislature, according to the National Immigration Law Center. 
The center issued a statement after the Senate vote calling the action a “shameful attempt to take away Tennessee children’s freedom.” The public interest law firm is “prepared to defend the right to education for all alongside our partners in court,” the statement said.
‘Economically reckless’ Small businesses slam bill to bar immigrant kids from school

The bill, among the most controversial in the Legislature this year, has drawn strong — but not unanimous — support from Tennessee’s Republican supermajority, pushback from Democrats and public protests that have disrupted legislative hearings. 
Thursday’s debate drew emotional invocations of Christian faith by both Democrats and Republicans opposed to the bill. Ultimately seven Republicans joined Senate Democrats in casting “no” votes.
Senate Speaker Pro Tem Ferrell Haile, a Gallatin Republican, quoted the Biblical prophet Ezekial: “The child will not share the guilt of the parent nor the parent share the guilt of the child.”
“I believe that we are punishing children for the wrongdoing of their parents. I don’t think that’s the proper way to do (this),” Haile said in explaining his decision to vote against the bill.
“We need to address the issue itself rather than using children as a pawn in this,” he said. 
Haile suggested the state instead ascertain how many children without legal immigration status attend Tennessee public schools and then use that data to file a lawsuit against the federal government seeking reimbursement for the cost of their education.
Sen. Charlane Oliver, a Nashville Democrat, told lawmakers she spoke in opposition to the bill with a “heavy heart,” asking Watson what he thought would become of children denied the right to attend school.
Hamilton County principals oppose bill to require immigration status checks on schoolchildren

Immigrant children barred from Tennessee public schools have other options, he said.
“The bill does not prohibit private school. It does not prohibit home schooling,” Watson said, noting that families were also free to pay tuition to attend public school if their child was excluded because of immigration status.
Watson also suggested that nonprofit organizations would step forward to help pay students’ tuition, which would be set at roughly the equivalent school districts charge students attending a public school outside their county of residence. 
Watson in a previous legislative hearing did not rule out that the legislation could also lead to the state Department of Education creating rules and regulations to mandate schools to report what they learn about students’ immigration status to federal immigration enforcement authorities.
The bill has yet to be reconciled with its House counterpart, which gives public school districts and public charter schools the option — rather than the mandate — to check student immigration status, exclude children or charge tuition.
The House bill from Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Republican from Portland,  will be heard again in a legislative committee next week before it can move to a floor vote. 
Both Lamberth and Watson have cited the rising costs of English-language instruction in the state’s public schools as driving the policy proposal. 
There is no currently no available data about how many children receiving the instruction have legal immigration status and how many do not. 
Republican backers of the legislation have said they hope it will be challenged in court and ultimately reach the Supreme Court in order to revisit its 1982 Plyler v. Doe decision, which established all children have a right to a public school education in the United States, regardless of immigration status.

Thousands of Michigan voters — including scores of military members and their families — could see their voting rights curtailed if President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on voting is allowed to take effect.
The order, issued late last month, introduces major changes to how elections would be run. Among its most concerning provisions for those who serve in the military or live outside the U.S.: a requirement that all voters submit proof of citizenship and that all ballots, including those coming from abroad, must arrive by the close of polls on Election Day to be counted.
Voters who live overseas or serve in the military are largely protected by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, known as UOCAVA. It guarantees that those living away from their home states or around the world can still cast their ballots.
The order represents the latest in a series of Republican attacks on UOCAVA voting, which has historically seen bipartisan support. Conspiracy theories have stoked the belief that the program — which has shown no evidence of fraud — might be used in some way to steal elections. But for the nearly 22,000 Michigan voters who used the program to cast their ballots last year, this new assault could simply make voting more difficult.
Trump’s order would change several key aspects of election administration, but it offers two key components that could hurt military voters. The first: voters registering would have to prove their citizenship. Citizenship is already required to vote in U.S. elections although documentary proof is not, and violators face harsh penalties.
“Somehow voters are going to have to find a way to send a passport, or maybe a picture of a passport, but I can tell you that can pose a security risk of identity theft,” said Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, founder of the Overseas Vote Foundation. “Email goes through multiple servers before it’s delivered, and it could go through countries we don’t realize. Is it going to bounce? Can that email be intercepted? Or should we send a paper version of our passport? That shouldn’t travel around.”
Voters who live abroad already have to jump through a number of hoops to cast their ballot, she said. While it could be possible to go to the closest consulate cto prove citizenship, the U.S. has been considering closing some of these offices in several countries.
“This isn’t very well thought through,” she added. “The requirement to show up in person would decimate us.”
While many people who live overseas have a passport, which would be an acceptable verification of citizenship under the order, there is no requirement for members of the military to have a passport. Servicemembers can use their military IDs to travel for work if needed — another ID named in the order — but those don’t typically have any indication of citizenship. The Department of Defense has remained quiet on what that could look like for those serving overseas.
One of the other most significant changes would be the declaration that all ballots must be in by Election Day to be counted. Michigan is one of several states that allows military and overseas voters to return ballots within a few days after the election as long as it is postmarked in time.
That’s not just state law — it’s a right that was amended into the Michigan Constitution when voters overwhelmingly approved Proposal 2 in 2022. Previously, those ballots had to be received by the close of polls, but voters living out of the country now get six additional days for their ballots to arrive and still be counted.
That helps to combat not only the complex process of getting mail from overseas but also recent problems with the U.S. postal system as well, said Barb Byrum, Ingham County Clerk, after the order was announced.
“This would disenfranchise many of our military and overseas voters,” she said.
Cheri Hardmon, spokesperson for the Michigan Secretary of State’s office, confirmed that 1,440 ballots came during the extended window in November, including more than 300 military ballots.
Across the U.S., each state sets its own deadline for UOCAVA ballots to come in. Michigan and Texas each give voters six days after the election, while Pennsylvania voters get a week. In Arizona and many other states, though, the ballot is due by the time polls close on Election Day. The deadlines for the return of UOCAVA ballots are typically independent of the deadline for mail ballots for local voters.
Michigan has been at the center of many of the fights over overseas voting. For example, the Republican National Committee sued Michigan and other battleground states last year after Trump alleged without proof that Democrats would use UOCAVA to receive ballots by email.
In the Michigan suit, the RNC took issue with Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s guidance to local clerks. In it, Benson advised them that a “United States citizen who has never resided in the United States but who has a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who was last domiciled in Michigan is eligible to vote in Michigan as long as the citizen has not registered or voted in another state.”
Such an allowance is standard under UOCAVA to cover the adult children of U.S. servicemembers who grew up overseas, for example. Those people are considered Michigan residents under voting law. But the RNC alleged such advice meant the state was allowing non-Michigan residents to cast ballots. A Michigan Court of Claims judge slapped down the suit shortly before voting started last year but the case is now making its way through appeals.
The Secure Families Initiative, one of the groups that has filed lawsuits against the executive order, alleges that Trump overstepped his office when issuing the order. Secure Families is a group of military family members who focus on protecting the military vote and civil rights, including filing an amicus brief in the RNC suit with the ACLU of Michigan.
Their lawsuit against Trump’s executive order, joined by the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Arizona Students’ Association, is one of several in the weeks since the order was released.
Nicole Meek, an Air Force spouse who works with SFI’s voting rights leadership team, said it has already been hard for military families to vote, and those real and perceived barriers further limit participation.
“Increasing any one of these restrictions would only further disenfranchise military voters,” Meek said.
Her family lives in a different state than the one she votes in, and even just renewing her driver’s license for her home state can be difficult and require months of planning. Casting a ballot often feels like an even bigger task, one that requires voters to know they’re planning to vote as soon as their ballot arrives so they don’t risk postal failures or other timing issues.
She’s seen it happen to her husband, to her friends — basically everyone she knows has struggled to get their hands on a ballot then get that ballot back to where it belongs.
“Even when you’re following all the rules, there’s so many stories like this,” she said. “Military voters should get the benefit of the postmark date. That’s the case in many states, but eliminating that would disenfranchise so many people.”
Continued attacks on a secure way of voting could be dangerous, Dzieduszycka-Suinat said. UOCAVA has always been bipartisan, not to mention secure and increasingly efficient. The new executive order has come with limited guidance and the federal government entities who might provide support have remained silent.
“”People say, ‘well, how am I going to do that?’ Then they panic,” she said. “Everybody knows that every time you add another step into the process, you chip away at the number of people doing it.”
She found some comfort in the idea that the order is likely to be gutted by the courts, but the introduction alone was enough to give her pause.
“The rights haven’t been taken away, not yet,” she said, “but … if it’s really going to happen, this is definitely going to be a scourge on all overseas voters and suppress participation in elections.”

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A day after the release of a long-awaited report on how Rhode Island could start a deposit-refund program for recyclable bottles and cans, a trio of bottle bills tackling production, retailer and consumer responsibilities emerged.
The longest and most comprehensive proposal comes from Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat and longtime champion of the “bottle bill.” McEntee’s bill calls for a 10 cents per-bottle fee, which consumers could reclaim upon returning the containers to designated redemption sites run by a nonprofit contractor hired by beverage producers.
The vendor would work with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) to set up and carry out the bottle return and redemption program, according to McEntee’s bill. Refunds on returned bottles would begin July 1, 2029.
Such a system was first introduced in Oregon in 1971, which has an 87% recycling rate  as of 2023 — the highest nationwide. 
A separate entity known as a producer responsibility organization, overseen by a state advisory panel, would head up the back-end, working with manufacturers to meet state recycling requirements.and work with manufacturers .
“I’ve introduced a bottle bill for several years, and this is the best version yet,” McEntee said in a statement Wednesday. “We listened closely to all of the interested parties and worked hard to write a bill that takes their concerns into consideration and creates something that will both reduce litter and improve recycling, with zero cost to taxpayers.” 
Those latest considerations come from a report published Tuesday by the 18-member joint legislative panel she’s co-chaired for the last two years — a report which was initially supposed to be completed last June, though the commission’s work was then extended through April 30, 2025.
The 18-page report paints a dire picture of what will happen if the state avoids dealing with its recycling and litter problem.

Stroll down most sidewalks and you’re likely to find discarded empty bottles, cans, and tiny nips containers of alcohol. Many beverage containers also get tossed in the trash instead of recycling bins, adding to the ever-growing mountain of waste at the 154-acre Central Landfill in Johnston, which is expected to reach capacity in 2046 under existing disposal rates
“It is clear to us as co-chairs that the recycling system in Rhode Island is not working well enough,” McEntee wrote along with her fellow commission co-chair, Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat. 
Which is why they want to incentivize more Rhode Islanders to return their bottles either at drop depots or reverse vending machines, which allow a person to insert their empty bottles in exchange for money. The commission’s report came with three options for the General Assembly to consider:

A deposit-refund program for recyclable bottles and cans run by a third-party vendor, with no requirement that retailers accept empty recyclables, addressed in legislation introduced by Rep. Tina Spears, a Charlestown Democrat.
An education and enforcement program, overseen by a state advisory board, that works with beverage producers to meet recycling targets, outlined in a bill by Rep. David Bennett, a Warwick Democrat
A combination of both the deposit-refund program and the producer education and enforcement program — covered by McEntee’s bill

All three bills were referred to the House Committee on Environment and Natural Resources where they will be scheduled after lawmakers return from break on April 22.
Such programs have existed in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont since the 1970s and ‘80s. And it’s an idea that is getting more popular support in the Ocean State.
A poll released March 7 by Save the Bay found 55% of respondents supported a 10-cent deposit on all beverages in recyclable containers.
“If it can work in all these other states, there’s no reason it shouldn’t work in Rhode Island,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay and a member of the study panel, said in an interview Thursday.
But the bottle bill has regularly been denounced by retailers like grocery and liquor store owners, concerned over the cost, logistics, and administrative burden.
Store owners have told the commission that if bottles are not labeled properly, they can’t be redeemed and that bottle deposit machines can often attract rodents and bugs.
The commission’s report called the concerns legitimate, but stated that they’re related to “old-style” bottle bills.
“Model programs handle containers in a far cleaner, more efficient and convenient manner,” the report states.
The commission recommends the state create a network of options that consumers can easily use, such as bag-drop programs, return depots, and reverse vending machines. Retailers would not be required to take back empty containers either.
“These successful programs rest on the pillars of incentive and convenience,” the report states. “When it’s as easy to recycle as to toss an item, the system works.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said he has not yet looked at the commission’s report, but would have his newest advisor, former DEM director Janet Coit, review it. “I look forward to hearing her analysis, as well as discussing the issues further with the commission chairs,” Shekarchi said in an email Thursday.
McKenney’s companion legislation has not been introduced in the Senate as of Thursday.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)A major private prison company wants a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Newark over the company’s planned new immigration jail, framing the case as a politically charged attempt to sidestep federal authority.
In a 37-page court filing made public Wednesday, prison firm Geo Group argues that Newark’s legal challenge can’t move forward without U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a party, since the federal agency has a contract with Geo Group to house immigrant detainees at the proposed jail. And because ICE is shielded by sovereign immunity, the entire case should be thrown out, the company says.
“The current action represents the latest in a series of efforts by New Jersey officials to cripple federal immigration enforcement in the state,” the filing reads.
Geo Group announced in February it signed a 15-year contract with ICE to operate the new immigrant detention center, called Delaney Hall and located near the Essex County jail in Newark. The facility, which previously housed immigrant detainees between 2011 and 2017, would be the second private migrant detention center in New Jersey and the largest on the east coast if it reopens.
A 2021 state law bars private and public entities from contracting with ICE to house immigrant detainees, but a federal judge struck down part of the law pertaining to private companies in 2023. The state’s appeal of that decision is set to be heard by a federal appeals court in Philadelphia next month.
Plans to open Delaney Hall drew swift backlash from local officials and activists. At a March protest, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka — one of six candidates vying for the Democratic nomination for governor — vowed he’d “padlock” the facility if necessary to keep immigration detention out of the state’s largest city.
Geo Group moved ahead with plans to open the jail, and on April 1, Newark officials filed suit in state Superior Court in Essex County claiming that Geo Group was renovating the building without proper city permits and had barred city inspectors from accessing the building. The city alleged that without proper inspections, it could not know whether the building is safe to open.
Geo Group’s attorneys, who have moved the case to federal court, allege that city officials who came to inspect the site were told to coordinate with ICE, but the city refused to do so. ICE has sole control over the facility’s secure areas and ICE required the city to make that appointment, the company says.
The prison company also references Baraka’s threat to “padlock” the building, claiming that the “conclusions and findings of any sham ‘inspections’ performed have already been clearly telegraphed” by the mayor.
“There can be no question that ICE has an interest in Newark’s attempts to force entry into a federal detention facility so that Newark can ostensibly conduct inspections of a federal facility under state and local codes,” the filing states.
Eric Pennington, the city’s business administrator, said Newark officials will work with the company to make sure that the facility complies with all city and state laws, rules and regulations.
“The city wants to ensure that the facility is safe for occupation by employees, and proposed residents,” he said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Academic standards that have been proposed for Oklahoma social studies education, which would include biblical content and suggestions of “discrepancies” in the 2020 presidential election, have a clearer path toward passage with one Republican leader saying his chamber isn’t preparing to reject them.
The standards, if passed, would mandate the topics public schools must teach to students in social studies classes.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said Thursday he wouldn’t vote against the proposal. Among the Republican supermajority in the state Senate, there isn’t “a whole lot of movement to reject those standards,” Paxton said during a weekly briefing with news reporters.
“I have not read all 400 pages (of the standards),” Paxton said. “What I have read through I do not have objections to. We can always go through there and find little things here and there. But what I’ve read through so far, I have not had enough objections that I would try to undo what the (state) school board approved.”
The Oklahoma State Board of Education, including three recently appointed members, approved the proposed standards on Feb. 27, sending them to the state Legislature for review. Only one state board member voted against the standards, saying he didn’t have enough time since his recent appointment to properly review them all.
It came to light after the board vote that the Oklahoma State Department of Education quietly made changes to the original draft of the proposal without acknowledging it.

Among the changes was the addition of language suggesting there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results, including “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
State Superintendent Ryan Walters later said the standards weren’t written to support or deny the 2020 presidential election outcome but to challenge students to make their own conclusions.

Both the House and Senate would have to agree on a resolution to revise or reject the standards. Lawmakers have until May 1 to pass a joint resolution or the standards will take effect as written, the House Speaker’s Office has said.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said the Republicans in his chamber haven’t decided yet whether to take any action.

“If we were to do something, it would need to be collaboratively with the Senate, and I’m not sure where the Senate is on that issue,” Hilbert said while speaking with reporters on Wednesday. “But I do know we have some members digging into it to potentially come up with some proposals of if we would accept, reject or revise.”
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions on March 31 to reject the standards and send them back to the state Board of Education for revisions. A majority of lawmakers in both Republican-dominated chambers would have to agree to rejection.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said she’s heard nothing from the majority caucus about her resolution.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the pro tem has been “open to the conversation” but Republican senators are split on the issue.

“I don’t think they have full caucus support to move (a resolution to reject) forward,” Kirt said of the GOP majority. “I think it’s a very divisive issue, which is I think what Superintendent Walters chooses to do, which is bring up things that divide us instead of things we can work on together.”
Both Democratic leaders said Oklahomans have contacted them with concerns about Walters’ social studies standards taking effect. They said they encouraged residents to share their objections with their state lawmakers.
Although House Republicans haven’t made a decision on the standards, Hilbert said Walters did “a good job” pitching his proposal to their caucus during a private meeting last week.
The House speaker said Walters’ experience as a former high school history teacher shone through during the presentation.
“You saw the AP history (teacher) in Ryan Walters come out when he was going through the social studies standards, and he did a really good job of explaining them,” Hilbert said. “I think that that had a good impression on folks. And it’s always good, again, to hear from his side of the explanation and those potential standards put into context.”

Laura Kelly, but Kansas House decides to leave her vetoes intact.","Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, convinced the Senate to take an unusual path to overriding Gov. Laura Kelly's line-item vetoes in a state budget bill. At his request, the Senate took a single vote to override three-dozens of vetoes. The House, however, didn't secure a two-thirds majority to override Kelly on a smaller package of 15 vetoes. That meant, as of Thursday, all of Kelly's vetoes stand entering the final day of the session Friday. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — It was all or nothing as the Senate and House considered the tidal wave of budget vetoes generated by Gov. Laura Kelly.
On Thursday, the Senate instigated an extraordinary maneuver to reject with a single vote about three-dozen vetoes executed by the Democratic governor as she went line-by-line through the spending bill adopted by the Kansas Legislature. The vote was 30-10 in the GOP-controlled chamber to restore every provision of Senate Bill 125 deleted by Kelly.
The House, with a supermajority of Republicans, followed by offering representatives a curated package of 15 elements vetoed by the governor. In a frank presentation, House budget chairman Rep. Troy Waymaster said the short list in front of the House focused on what was worth salvaging.
“This is in a package because it came to us from the Senate in a package,” Waymaster said. “We went through the items, looked at the ones that were palatable, the ones that needed to be funded.”
The vote board in the House didn’t lie: 82-42. That was two votes short of the two-thirds majority required to overturn the governor’s vetoes on the group of 15. No lengthy attempt was made to rally Republicans to reach the 84-vote threshold. The House had already decided not to challenge vetoes of 18 other earmarks, so the chamber adjourned for the day.
Procedural avenues exist to compel reconsideration of veto override decisions in the House, but that would have to occur Friday before lawmakers ended the annual session. As it stands, the bulk of the Legislature’s sweeping budget bill was signed into law by Kelly and all the governor’s vetoes remain in place.
 
Swinging for the fence
Senate Democrats howled in opposition to the motion by Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover to avoid individual debate on the vetoes. He proposed the Senate dispense with the governor’s critique of the budget with one brisk up-or-down vote.
Masterson said he was aware the House might not follow the Senate’s one-and-done lead.
“The budget had a plethora of line-item vetoes,” Masterson said. “I’m going to make a global motion … to override all the line-item vetoes in Senate Bill 125 at one time.”
Initially, the Senate vote stood at 26-14 or one vote shy of the two-thirds majority needed to override Kelly. Then, four Republican senators — Caryn Tyson of Parker, Stephen Owens of Hesston, Brenda Dietrich of Topeka and Elaine Bowers of Concordia — changed their votes to “yes” to complete the override. The final tally was 30-10.
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes of Lenexa said the GOP leadership’s quick-strike method adhered to a theme of the 2025 session in which procedures were used to limit bipartisan debate on issues before the Legislature. She voted against the overrides.
“This is just fitting,” Sykes said. “This is a culmination of a condensed and rushed session. We are just amplifying what the public hates about politics and legislation. The ugliness that everyone hates — that’s what we just agreed to.”
 
Over in the House
Democrats in the House also expressed consternation such a diverse set of veto overrides would be tackled as a unit.
“Some people find it very strange that the Senate did the whole package and didn’t give people an opportunity to explain or talk about things,” said Lawrence Democratic Rep. Barbara Ballard, who noted the House GOP gave up more vetoes than they pursued. “Why would they give that up? Maybe, in some cases, you may not have the votes.”
Rep. Henry Helgerson, a Democrat from Eastborough, said it was “very rare” for the Legislature to consider vetoes in a big bundle. He struggled with the idea Republican and Democratic leaders in the House worked together on which pieces would be subjected to an override vote.
“One of my biggest objections to this process is we are taking away your vote all the time by putting it in the hands of these individuals,” he said.
Helgerson, who expects to be primaried by Democrats in 2026, said the budget adopted by the Legislature and signed by the governor would produce a revenue shortfall within a couple years.
“I see a $1 billion shortfall out there and we’re still spending more money,” he said. “When are you going to wake up and say, ‘Wait a minute?’ ”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100123-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

The H5N1 bird flu has impacted more than 168 million birds since February 2022, when outbreaks of the strain began in the country. Thus far, more than 900 flocks with cases of the flu were backyard flocks. 
This is the seventh HPAI detection in Iowa this year and the third detection in a backyard flock. Previous backyard flock detections in 2025 were in Dallas and Clinton counties. 
HPAI has a low public health risk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there have been 70 known cases of transmission to humans. Officials hold that poultry and eggs remain safe to consume. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins rolled out a five-pronged plan and $1 billion to stop the spread of HPAI and to reduce the cost of eggs in the country, which has increased largely due to supply disruptions from the bird flu.
The plan includes heightened biosecurity measures, audits and research into the virus and potential treatments for birds.

Representatives from Bennet’s campaign team declined to comment to Newsline.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, the only prominent Democrat to officially enter the race for governor so far, said in a statement on “Sen. Bennet’s Entry in the Governor’s Race” that while Bennet has been in Washington, D.C., he has been working directly with people in Colorado “as the People’s Lawyer.”
“I am the fighter Colorado needs as our next governor. Two years ago, the voters sent Senator Bennet back to DC because we believed he would be there for us no matter what — especially in historically dangerous moments like the one we currently face,” Weiser said. “Now more than ever, we need experienced Democratic leaders in Washington.”
Weiser added: “We must protect Colorado and oppose (President Donald) Trump’s illegal actions, not appease him.” Bennet voted in support of confirming several Trump cabinet nominees.
Whoever wins the Democratic nomination will most likely win the race, as Colorado hasn’t had a Republican governor since Gov. Bill Owens left office after the 2006 election. Republican candidates to announce a run for governor include state Sen. Mark Baisley, state Rep. Scott Bottoms, Teller County Sheriff Jason Mikesell and Brighton Fire Chief Brycen Garrison, among several others. 
In the case of a U.S. Senate vacancy, Colorado statute says the governor will appoint a replacement. Bennet’s Senate term ends in 2028.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-10 20:59:18+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT’s Medicaid income limits for disabled are illegal, lawsuit alleges",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/10/ct-disabled-medicaid-income-limits-husky-c/,Advocates argued CT’s lower HUSKY C income limits discriminate against residents with disabilities and violate the state constitution.,"Disability advocates gathered in front of Hartford’s Superior Court on Thursday to announce a lawsuit that contends that the lower income requirements for the disabled to qualify for Medicaid are discriminatory and violate the state constitution.
“We require people with disabilities to be extremely poor to quote-unquote deserve state-sponsored health care,” said Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton. “That is wrong, it is immoral and it’s left over from a legacy of dehumanization of people with disabilities. It is long overdue that we end this discrimination.”
Connecticut has three main Medicaid programs: HUSKY A, C, and D. To qualify for HUSKY A and D, a single adult can make up to $1,800 per month, but people with severe disabilities and the elderly can’t make more than $1,370 a month to qualify for HUSKY C. HUSKY C is also the only program with an asset limit — qualifying residents can have only $1,600 or less in the bank.
In 2023, lawmakers voted to raise the income limit for HUSKY C. Gov. Ned Lamont signed the bill at the time but then in 2024 amended the language in a way that significantly reduced the increase.
At the time, Lamont wrote that he wanted to amend the law to ensure that “the expansion aligns with the budgeted amount” and that the original law would have had a far higher price tag.
“Unwilling to adjust fiscal guardrails so that available money could be spent beyond what was budgeted, the legislature simply repealed the law to match the budget, rather than adjusting the budget to match the law,” the lawsuit states. 
At Thursday’s press conference, disability advocates recalled the legislative victory and subsequent defeat. 
“We had a win in 2023 for like five seconds,” said Catherine John. “We wrote letters, sent petitions. After several attempts to appeal to the governor to end discrimination, we stood outside of his mansion asking him to show empathy, compassion and understanding for those whose voices have continue to be silenced.” 
“How evil is that?” said Richard Famiglietti, consumer advocate at the Center for Disability Rights. “Today I’m asking Gov. Lamont not to be a zero, but to be my hero again and allow people on HUSKY C to have the same income and asset limits as everybody on HUSKY D.”
A representative for Lamont said that his office is not able to comment on pending litigation. A spokesperson for the Department of Social Services, whose commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves is named in the complaint, said the same. 
One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Laura DiErrico, also spoke on Thursday. DiErrico doesn’t qualify for HUSKY C because she makes a few hundred dollars more each month than the income limit — but less than would be needed to qualify for HUSKY A or D. DiErrico, who has multiple sclerosis, said that her condition caused her to lose her balance and crack her front teeth in 2023. But because she makes too much money to qualify for HUSKY C, her dental care wasn’t covered, and she spent two years with painful and embarrassing dental issues before getting into debt to finally fix her teeth.
“It is essential to recognize that this is not just my story, it is the story of many individuals with disabilities who find themselves in similar situations or worse,” DiErrico said. “We are not asking for special treatment for others to be denied care. Rather, we are advocating for fairness and the right to access the health care that we need to live with dignity and health.”
Attorneys representing the plaintiffs expressed confidence that the state constitution clearly supports their case, because it specifically protects people with physical or mental disabilities from discrimination. 
Connecticut finds itself in a precarious budgetary moment, as federal cuts threaten to create gaps that could leave vulnerable residents without the services they depend on. That makes this a particularly difficult year to push for more people to qualify for HUSKY C. But advocates said they had no choice but to file the lawsuit now.

(Photo courtesy Dylan Taylor/University of Florida)As the University of Florida signed an agreement to collaborate with the federal government in immigration enforcement, four students have had their visas revoked.
The move to involve campus police in immigration enforcement at the state’s flagship university and the acknowledgement of the visa revocations were reported Thursday by The Independent Florida Alligator, a student-run newspaper.
Cynthia Roldan, UF’s director of public affairs, wrote to the Florida Phoenix that she could confirm only that the university had signed the agreement to deputize campus police as immigration officers, and could not provide information about details.
She didn’t respond to a request to confirm the visa revocations.
Reports of the agreement came after ICE held Felipe Zapata Velásquez, a Colombian student on a visa at UF, at the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami following his March 28 arrest for driving with an expired license. The 27-year-old chose to self-deport, according to the Miami Herald.
The Alligator reported that ICE listed UF as a participating entity, but the agency’s latest database of participating entities didn’t include UF.
However, after the Florida Phoenix reported that Florida Atlantic University had also sought federal authorization to arrest and question people the police suspected of living in the country without authorization, the university police department disappeared from ICE’s database.
An FAU spokesperson confirmed on April 3 that the public university in Boca Raton had submitted signed paperwork for approval from ICE.
Joshua Glazer, associate vice president for media relations and public affairs, wrote to the Phoenix last week that FAUPD and other state university police departments were expected to collaborate with ICE, per Gov. Ron DeSantis’ directive.
The University of South Florida in Tampa also plans to collaborate with ICE. Its police chief, Christopher Daniel, signed an agreement with ICE to deputize campus officers on March 24, according to a copy of the agreement published by The Oracle, USF’s student newspaper.
The public university in Tampa doesn’t appear in the ICE databases, either.
When campus police officers could start arresting people on behalf of ICE is not known. Officers must complete a 40-hour online training before certification from the federal government.
Although all sheriffs, state agencies with law enforcement officers, and dozens of city police departments around the state have signed up to participate, only approximately 1,400 state troopers have completed the training, according to a Wednesday post on X from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
ICE has not responded to requests about the removal of the universities from its databases.

(Photo via Google Earth)The federal government has resumed its practice of disclosing to the public its list of the nation’s worst nursing homes — and four Iowa homes have been added to that list.
Prior to President Donald Trump taking office in January, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had, for 17 years, published a monthly, national list of so-called Special-Focus Facilities. The list was comprised of nursing homes that had experienced a serious recurrence of major regulatory violations related to quality of care.
Once a home was designated a Special-Focus Facility, it received additional oversight and assistance from the government that’s intended to improve resident care.

At any given time, no more than two nursing homes per state were designated a Special-Focus Facility, although the federal list also included hundreds of other nursing homes whose quality-of-care violations made them eligible for enrollment in the program.
After Trump took office, CMS suspended the publication of monthly updates to the list, presumably because of a directive that barred CMS and other federal agencies from issuing any statements or reports to the press or public that hadn’t first been cleared by the White House.
Recently, CMS posted its first update to the list in 2025. It shows that during the 2025 moratorium on updates, four Iowa nursing homes were added to list of facilities that are considered eligible for special-focus status: Accura Healthcare of Pleasantville, Aspire of Perry, Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, and Harvest Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Keota.
Senate passes bill on nursing home reviews, rejects Democrats’ calls for more oversight

The two Iowa care facilities that are not only eligible for special-focus status, but are actually enrolled in the program and receiving additional oversight and guidance, are unchanged from last year. They are Arbor Court in Mount Pleasant, which has been in the program for two full years; and Aspire of Gowrie, which has been in the program for a year and a half.
In addition to the four Iowa homes added to the eligibility list, there are six Iowa care facilities that remain on the list from 2024 when it was last updated: Garden View Care Center in Shenandoah, which has been on the eligibility list for four months; Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation in Des Moines, which has been on the list for 32 months; Harmony West in West Des Moines, which has been on the list for 17 months; The Ivy in Davenport, which has been on the list for 18 months; Pine Acres Rehabilitation and Care Center in West Des Moines, which has been on the list for 12 months; and Via of Des Moines, which has been on the list for 12 months.
Here’s a detailed look at the four newly eligible Iowa homes and a few of the issues each has faced in the past two years:
— Accura Healthcare of Pleasantville: This 46-bed facility is a part the for-profit Accura chain of nursing homes. Since April 2023, federal regulators have imposed three denials for payment for new admissions, and state inspectors have cited the business for 36 state and federal violations.
In September 2024, the state imposed an $8,000 fine against the home for failing to protect residents in the midst of a COVID-19 outbreak. According to state records, workers allegedly said the staff didn’t take steps to isolate COVID-positive residents until inspectors entered the home; the home didn’t screen visitors during an outbreak; administrators required several employees to report for work knowing they had tested positive for COVID-19; face masks were not used by the staff during an outbreak; and personal protective equipment such as gowns and eye protection were unavailable to the staff. Protective N95 masks for breathing had not been available for three weeks, inspectors found.
The administrator allegedly told inspectors she was unaware of the equipment shortages and lack of isolation and said facility had been operating “in crisis mode” and so COVID-positive staff were required to work as long as they were free of symptoms. The assistant director of nursing told inspectors no disciplinary action was taken against workers for ignoring infection-control protocols, according to state records.
Inspectors reported that one “very scared” resident who contracted COVID-19 in the home had to be taken to a hospital emergency room for treatment as he was short of breath, with oxygen levels below 90%. The state proposed fines of $8,000 for the infection-control violations and $6,000 for failing to provide sufficient nursing staff to meet residents’ needs. Both state fines were held in suspension. CMS later imposed a federal fine of $44,190 against the home.
— Aspire of Perry: This 35-bed facility is part of the for-profit Aspire chain of care facilities based in Florida. In the past two years, the Perry home has been cited for a total of 81 state and federal violations. In December 2024, it was cited for 32 violations, including resident abuse, and was fined a total of $500 by the state.
The fine was tied to findings that the home had allowed an individual to work with residents as both a nurse aide and a medication aide despite the person having no certification as a medication aide and being listed on the state’s registry of known abusers.
Other violations related to handling medications, management of residents’ funds, failure to provide a safe and clean environment, residents’ assessments and care plans, food service, infection control and dozens of other issues resulted in no penalties.
— Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation Center: This 76-bed facility is owned or operated by a real estate investment trust based in California. In the past two years, the Clarion home has been cited for a total of 31 state and federal violations.
In October 2024, the state proposed, but held in suspension, a $7,000 fine for a series of errors involving resident medications. Part of the issue was that a male resident of the home didn’t receive his cancer medication as ordered and the staff seemed unsure as to when it was dispensed, according to state records. The manager at the man’s cancer treatment center told inspectors that failure to provide the drug “could be potentially fatal” to the resident.
Also in October 2024, two separate fines of $500 each for resident abuse were held in suspension by the state, according to state records. The alleged abuse involved a kitchen worker who was seen by colleagues entering a female resident’s room as often as eight times per day. The resident later complained the worker had kissed her and rubbed her arms and back and would enter her room uninvited and sit and talk to her. CMS fined the home $37,190, according to federal records.
— Harvest Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center of Keota: This 35-bed facility is managed by Mission Health of Florida, according to state records. In the past two years, Harvest Acres has been cited for a total of 45 state and federal violations.
In November 2024, the home was cited for 32 violations. At the time, the state proposed, but held in suspension, five separate fines totaling $21,000. The fines were tied to alleged incidents of resident abuse, failure to intervene and treat residents with changing conditions, and failure to provide residents with their prescribed diets.
Inspectors allege the home failed to adequately assess and treat a resident who fell at the home on Sept. 7, 2024. Two weeks later, on Sept. 22, the resident was admitted to a hospital with stroke-like symptoms. State records show that two days later the resident died, with the cause of death listed as complications from a head injury caused by a fall. CMS fined the home $203,060, according to federal records.

The North Providence Democrat reappeared for a single day of session on March 25, but has not been back since.
He now plans to return to the rostrum the week of April 21, following the legislature’s scheduled break next week, Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson, confirmed in an email.
Paré said the upper chamber’s 76-year-old leader is “doing well,” and remains in “constant contact by phone” with his leadership team and colleagues in the House of Representatives.

Ruggerio declined Rhode Island Current’s request to discuss his health by phone this week, Paré said in an email on Ruggerio’s behalf. However, Paré said Ruggerio was willing to discuss topics other than his health.
“He has been very public and transparent about his health situation,” Paré said. 
Ruggerio discussed his treatment for and recovery from cancer and shingles as part of a Dec. 17 interview with Rhode Island Current about his 2025 legislative priorities. He first revealed his most recent cancer diagnosis — his third bout — in an April 2024 interview with the Providence Journal. 
“For the time being, he is going to focus on rebuilding his strength so that he can be here in person when sessions get busy,” Paré said.
The Rhode Island General Assembly’s return to Smith Hill following the April break typically marks an inflection point in the six-month-long session, when lawmakers transition from reviewing legislation in public hearings to passing and negotiation in earnest on key bills.
Ruggerio’s multiple absences from the session this year — missing 13 of 17 regularly scheduled floor sessions including on Thursday — have not gone unnoticed, reminiscent of similar bouts of absence due to illness during the 2024 session. Doubts about Ruggerio’s ability to lead led to a power struggle in which his former Senate majority leader, Ryan Pearson, challenged him for the president role. Ruggerio fended off the attempted coup, though nearly one-third of Senate Democrats backed Pearson in their November caucus.
Ruggerio pledged he was committed and healthy enough to lead the 38-member chamber through its 2025 session. But a “touch of pneumonia” — in Paré’s words — landed him in Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in mid-February. Ruggerio was subsequently treated at the hospital’s rehabilitation center, and released on March 12.
Senate President Pro Tempore Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat and Deputy Senate President Pro Tempore Matt LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, have filled in presiding over the Senate in Ruggerio’s absence.
Ruggerio in an emailed statement Wednesday credited Majority Leader Valarie Lawson, Majority Whip David Tikoian, and other senators for “ensuring that the Senate has never skipped a beat” in his absence.
“We are fortunate to have an incredible team of dedicated and talented public servants in the Senate, and our important work continues to move the state forward,” Ruggerio said.
After this week, the Rhode Island General Assembly will reconvene on April 22.

Among them: Hartford HealthCare, the hospital’s owner, had to study the feasibility of opening a freestanding birth center in the region.
That study is now complete. And in a meeting with members of the community earlier this week, Guidehouse, the independent consultancy that conducted the report, presented its findings.
Opening a birth center is not feasible, the consultants concluded.
“Based on the findings from the variety of assessments and analytics,” the report reads, “Guidehouse believes a [freestanding birth center] is not feasible to establish and provide safe and high-quality care for women” in Windham Hospital’s service area.
The Guidehouse consultants said their analysis concluded there isn’t enough demand in the Windham area to sustain a birth center. If the study had concluded it was necessary and possible to do so, the hospital would have had to either find a provider to operate a birth center or operate it themselves. 
A freestanding birth center provides a home-like alternative to hospitals, but can only handle low-risk pregnancies. The centers are typically staffed by midwives and doulas, and they do not provide surgical care or anesthesia. 
The concept is relatively new to Connecticut. In 2023, the legislature passed a law to allow freestanding birth centers in the state, and to date there is just one, located in Danbury, a spokesperson with the Department of Public Health confirmed.  
Each center needs about 115 annual births to break even and 500 births to be financially viable, according to industry benchmarks, the consultants said. The region around Windham wouldn’t meet that demand, they said. 
In two different estimates, Guidehouse found the number of eligible births in Windham Hospital’s primary service area that could have taken place at a freestanding birth center in 2023 were 88 and 75. Furthermore, the local population of people who could qualify to give birth at a birth center is decreasing, the consultants said.
Most of the local residents in attendance at Tuesday’s meetings didn’t seem surprised by the findings, given that Windham is located in a rural part of the state. 
But during the question and answer portion, they expressed anger at Hartford HealthCare for cuts to services the company has made since its acquisition of the hospital in 2009, including the closure of its labor and delivery unit. 
Brenda Buchbinder, a member of Windham United to Save Our Healthcare, a group that has fought the closures at Windham Hospital, said when Hartford HealthCare acquired the hospital, the company promised to bring enhanced services to the community.
“Then what we experienced was slowly but surely regionalizing all of our basic care and making us a shell of a hospital,” Buchbinder said. “The pain of this community is palpable. I think people are watching helplessly as these changes happen and the gutting happens.”
In 2015, Hartford HealthCare announced the conversion of Windham’s critical care unit to what’s known as a progressive care unit, which can’t handle the same complexity of care. In 2023, that unit was closed for 306 days, according to Hartford HealthCare’s 
Windham Hospital stopped performing births in June 2020. Three months later, Hartford HealthCare applied for state approval — known as a “certificate of need” — to officially close the unit, pointing to patient safety concerns due to low birth volumes and difficulty recruiting health care providers. The state approved the closure in December 2023. 
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare said the feasibility study and the agreed settlement with OHS “underscore our commitment to a safe childbirth experience, while acknowledging the existing and enhanced pre- and post-natal programs and services we continue to provide.” 
Windham Hospital has also enhanced those services, the statement went on, by adding “transportation for patients, a nurse navigator program, a bilingual nurse midwife and improved access to Backus Hospital Birthing Center.” In the last year, the health system has added an urgent care center, opened a substance use disorder center and added other services in Windham, the spokesperson noted.
Windham is just one of three rural hospitals in Connecticut that requested permission to shutter labor and delivery over the last several years. Johnson Memorial in Stafford Springs also received approval to do so, with the same requirement that the hospital’s owner, Trinity Health of New England, hire a consultant to study the feasibility of opening a birth center in the area. The results of that study are still pending.
Sharon Hospital, owned by Nuvance Health, also applied to close its maternity unit, but the state ultimately rejected the application. (Nuvance, which owns Danbury, Norwalk, Sharon and New Milford hospitals, is expected to be acquired by New York-based Northwell Health after the Connecticut Office of Health Strategy approved the deal earlier this week.)
Deidre Gifford, the commissioner of OHS, said Windham Hospital’s agreement with the state also “required the hospital to enhance OB/GYN and women’s health services” in the area, and she said Windham “continues to participate in all compliance monitoring requirements for the other conditions indicated in the agreement.” 
OHS is also monitoring the continuity of progressive care unit services at the hospital and said the PCU is currently “open and fully operational.”
The hospital is also required to report to the state demographic characteristics of the pregnant people who receive care at Windham Women’s Health Clinic. Between December 2023 and November 2024, 69 of the 79 patients who gave birth did so at Backus Hospital. Eighty-five percent used self-transport, while 13% were transported via ambulance and 3% used a rideshare.
Roughly 70% of the patients identified as Hispanic or Latino and 37% spoke Spanish. Eighty-five percent received health insurance coverage through Medicaid.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1113_SR_MaternityRally_033-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

(Photo by Getty Images)The Maine Legislature on Thursday passed a bill that will bolster the state’s strained public defense system by creating new staff positions and increasing funding for private counsel representing defendants who can’t afford their own attorneys.
Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) introduced LD 1101 as emergency legislation to address Maine’s severe shortage of public defenders, a crisis that has left hundreds of indigent defendants without representation — dozens of them incarcerated. The bill passed both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate and is now headed to Governor Janet Mills for her signature, bypassing the appropriations table where all bills with a cost typically go for approval.
If signed into law, LD 1101 would represent a key step in Maine’s ongoing efforts to improve access to legal representation, a constitutional right that advocates say is not being guaranteed under the current system. The legislation would allocate roughly $3.2 million over three years, create eight new positions within the state’s public defender offices, and allow private attorneys to take on cases with compensation from the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services, the agency overseeing the state’s fledgling public defense system.
State commission, lawmakers declare ‘all hands on deck’ effort to address indigent defense crisis

Before the Senate voted 31-3 to pass the measure, debate erupted in the House over a proposal from Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) to strip the bill of its funding and the new staff positions.
Fredette said he appreciated the Judiciary Committee’s work but argued that the goals of the bill could be met without any additional resources — a position he claimed was supported by Kennebec Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy’s March 7 ruling on the case and shared by Mills.
Fredette said on the House floor that he and the governor are on the same page about this bill, adding that he had spoken with Mills that morning.
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to questions about whether she supported Fredette’s amendment or if she would sign the bill with that funding included.
Several of Fredette’s Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee pushed back and said the bill represents a compromise.
If using existing resources was the solution, that would have happened months ago, argued Rep. Jen Poirier (R-Skowhegan). 
People deserve justice and we need to make that happen, she said.
House Majority Leader Rep. Matt Moonen (D-Portland) also said the current system, under which they pay public employees salary and benefits, is less expensive than the previous system where the state issued vouchers to private counsel. He also noted Maine’s public defenders are not very well paid and many are just out of law school and not yet able to take full caseloads. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, he said the system is working, as the number of unrepresented people has fallen from 1,500 last fall to roughly 500. 
Fredette’s amendment was tabled by a vote of 91-53 before the House voted 113-32 to pass the bill.
In her State of the Budget address in January, Mills expressed support for removing caseload limits on public defenders — a proposal some legal experts have criticized, warning it could overwhelm already understaffed offices. Gerald Reid, the governor’s chief legal counsel, submitted written testimony to the Judiciary Committee last month expressing conditional support for the bill, while reiterating the governor’s position on eliminating caseload caps.
At the public hearing, organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine and the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers underscored the urgent need for more funding and staff. They pointed to the state’s failure to provide court-appointed attorneys to hundreds of eligible defendants, a breakdown that Maine courts have called a constitutional crisis. While advocates said the bill does not go far enough to fully meet the demand, they described it as necessary to move the state toward a more functional and equitable system.
The committee unanimously backed an amended version of the bill, which added a sunset clause for court-appointed private attorneys and refined eligibility and oversight provisions.
Meanwhile, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled last month that the state must create a plan by April 3 to end what it described as a constitutional crisis. It also agreed to a request from the ACLU to start releasing incarcerated defendants who have been waiting for counsel if the state fails to provide representation. 
On Monday, the court was expected to start setting dates for hearings to determine if those defendants should be released and under what conditions. 
Anyone who has been incarcerated for more than 14 days without counsel is eligible, if the judge decides they should be released. The state will get another seven days to find an attorney before that actually happens, so a person could technically be incarcerated for a minimum of 21 days before release, according to the ACLU.

(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include a quote from Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador.
A federal judge on Thursday extended a temporary block on a new law meant to deter unauthorized immigration in Idaho. 
Federal judge Amanda Brailsford heard arguments on Thursday morning from attorneys with the ACLU of Idaho and the Idaho Office of the Attorney General on whether to issue a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit against House Bill 83. The preliminary injunction would block enforcement of the law throughout the remainder of the court process. In addition to extending the temporary block, Brailsford granted provisional class-action status, which blocks enforcement of House Bill 83 statewide. 
Modeled after a controversial 2023 Texas law that also faces a lawsuit, House Bill 83 creates Idaho immigration crimes “illegal entry” and “illegal reentry.” Law enforcement would only be able to convict someone of those crimes if they are suspected for a different crime. It also creates the crime of “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien,” or knowingly transporting an unauthorized immigrant who has previously been convicted of a crime in the U.S. or another country.
ACLU of Idaho sues state for new immigration enforcement bill just signed into law

The bill was set to take effect immediately after Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed it into law on March 27. However, the lawsuit filed by immigrant advocacy groups and individuals — represented by the ACLU of Idaho — blocked the law from taking effect on the day it was signed. 
“This is a huge win for our immigrant community and the Constitution,” ACLU of Idaho Legal Director Paul Carlos Southwick said. “We are pleased that the court agreed our case is likely to succeed on the merits of our arguments, and that the court protected families from being torn apart by this cruel and unnecessary law.”
The judge is expected to release a decision on the ACLU of Idaho’s requested preliminary injunction in the coming weeks.
“The Constitution is clear that Idaho has no right to interfere with federal immigration Laws,” ACLU of Idaho Staff Attorney Emily Croston said in a press release. “And we will defend the constitutional rights of everyone, regardless of their country of origin, as the Constitution guarantees.” 
Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said the hearing reinforced that Idaho has the authority to protect public safety within the state.
“The court allowed key provisions of House Bill 83 to take immediate effect, affirming Idaho’s ability to work in tandem with federal immigration enforcement,” he said, referring to the the “trafficking a dangerous illegal alien” provision, which is not included in the ACLU of Idaho’s lawsuit. “While a temporary restraining order remains on two provisions of the bill, we will continue to defend the law in full in the courts.”

Board member Marie Manning, who voted for the increase, said Mackey went to Gov. Kay Ivey to request a reduction in his raise from $380,000 to $325,000. Mackey made $290,000 a year prior to the extension.
“Dr. Mackey has come back to the governor and her office and has asked for a reduction in the original amount,” Manning said. “And I want to see him raised up, where our superintendents in the local level, our super our chancellors in the two year schools and the four year schools are more equitable.”

Board member Jackie Zeigler was the only person to vote against the contract. She said the final draft of the contract was only made available to board members at 7 p.m. Wednesday.
“I think the process of how the contract procedures were laid out could have been done in a much better way. And if we had done so earlier versus later, we could have offset money,” she said. “ I’m frustrated, upset and wondering where we’re headed across our state.”
Although Zeigler voted against the contract revision, she said she supports Mackey and is proud to work with him. 
“I am in no way against anything about Dr. Mackey and his leadership,” she said.
Mackey’s salary is higher than states of similar sizes. Ellen Weaver, South Carolina’s state superintendent, makes $214,000, according to the South Carolina Daily Gazette. Robbie Fletcher, Kentucky’s commissioner of education, makes $273,000, according to the state’s transparent salary search.
In addition to Mackey’s salary increase, he also receives exclusive benefits including a state-issued vehicle and a $1,750 monthly housing allowance, according to his contract. The contract extends his employment until April 2029.
Tonya Chestnut, the vice president of the board, said at the start of the board’s work session that she wished the process was better and sought to establish procedures for the future.
“As we anticipate the election of a new governor, I believe it is essential for us to establish a comprehensive written guideline for future rules for future extensions of new contracts for state superintendents,” Chestnut said.
Mackey agreed with Chestnut.
“The process has been hard on everybody and all of us, but I do appreciate the opportunity to serve longer, and I enjoyed working with all of you, and y’all know that,” Mackey told the board members.

Free.,"U.S. House passes bill targeting voting by noncitizens, which is already against the law",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-bill-targeting-voting-noncitizens-which-already-against-law,,"The U.S. House passed a bill Thursday to require voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, approving a Republican priority over the objections of Democrats who said the bill would only create hurdles for eligible voters without actually improving fraud protection.The 220-208 vote sent the measure to the U.S. Senate, where it faces an uphill road to overcome the chamber’s 60-vote requirement for most legislation. If enacted, the bill would require states, which are responsible for administering elections, to obtain from people registering to vote in federal elections documents that prove U.S. citizenship.Acceptable documents under the act include any valid photo ID issued by the federal government, a state or tribe that shows the applicant’s place of birth was the United States, or a combination of a valid government-issued photo ID and another document proving citizenship such as a birth certificate or certificate of naturalization.Four House Democrats – Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Ed Case of Hawaii and Henry Cuellar of Texas – joined all Republicans present to vote in favor of the bill.Supporters of the bill say it is needed to keep immigrants in the country without legal status from voting.It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, though some local governments allow noncitizen residents to vote in local elections.GOP priorityBy tackling fraudulent voting and targeting immigrants in the country illegally, the bill addresses two planks of the Republican platform under President Donald Trump. Trump has consistently positioned himself as a hardliner on immigration and continues to voice the debunked claim that fraud caused his 2020 election loss.During floor debate this week, the bill’s sponsor, Texas Republican Chip Roy, said the measure, titled the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE, Act, responded to the message voters sent by electing Trump and Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress last year after inaction from Democratic President Joe Biden.“Republicans are responding to an American people who are tired of the previous administration that was allowing illegals to come into our country, kill our citizens, vote in our elections, undermine our country,” Roy said. “And we are addressing their concerns and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t want to address it.”Hurdle for citizensDemocrats, though, said the measure was unnecessary to prevent the exceedingly rare cases of noncitizens voting in federal elections and would only make voting harder for citizens who are eligible, including married women who may have changed their name but have not updated their documents.“I think the gentleman from Texas will be happy to learn that it already is the law that only American citizens can vote in federal elections,” Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, said following Roy’s remarks. “Our problem with the SAVE Act is that it is an attempt to make it more difficult for women in this country, women who are U.S. citizens, to be able to vote.”At a virtual press conference Thursday, Democratic secretaries of state – the office in most states responsible for elections administration – highlighted the difficulties it could create for eligible voters.“Losing your driver’s license or birth certificate, letting your passport expire or even getting married and taking your partner’s last name could all prevent a voter from making their voice heard in free and fair elections if the SAVE Act passes,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said. “Replacing just one of those documents – let alone multiple documents that would be needed to register – takes time and money that not every American has.“Women who are citizens – who are eligible to vote – should not be stopped at the ballot box by (House Speaker) Mike Johnson and Donald Trump.”",,,,2025-04-11 00:07:51.589337

Bill Tveit, R-Hazen, speaks during a Jan. 27, 2025, committee hearing on a bill to enforce school compliance with a law barring transgender students from using restrooms that align with their genders. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Senate voted 40-7 on Thursday to pass a bill that prevents K-12 public schools from having all-gender bathrooms.
House Bill 1144 also allows schools to be investigated by the North Attorney General’s Office and fined up to $2,500 by courts for non-compliance.
Lawmakers previously enacted gender-related bathroom restrictions for public schools in 2023. That law prevents transgender students from using bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender.
Supporters of House Bill 1144 say the 2023 law didn’t go far enough. 
Sponsor Rep. Bill Tveit, R-Hazen, expressed concerns schools won’t observe the policy without a formal enforcement mechanism.
Senators on Thursday approved amendments removing language forbidding single-occupancy all-gender restrooms, as well as a provision that stated that male and female restrooms could not share a communal sink or entry area. They also removed an exemption for certain schools and language stating concerns about non-compliant schools would have to be submitted to the state by parents.
The bill passed with little discussion from lawmakers.
Critics of the proposal have previously said the policy is attempting to fix a problem that doesn’t exist.
“The concerns in our schools about what’s going on in the bathrooms has very little to do with most of the testimony that has been shared so far this morning,” West Fargo Public Schools Business Manager Levi Bachmeier said at a March hearing on the bill.
Opponents also said the policy would pose a unique harm to transgender children. Some parents and school staff said access to safe bathrooms is already a significant obstacle for many transgender youth, and that banning all-gender restrooms would make this even more difficult.
The House passed House Bill 1144 in February with more than 80% support.
Bathroom bill would make schools less safe, opponents, LGBTQ advocates testify

Also Thursday, the Senate voted 41-6 to approve House Bill 1181, which amends Century Code to state “words used to reference an individual’s gender mean the individual’s sex.”
Sponsor SuAnn Olson, R-Baldwin, has called the proposal a “common sense” bill that is “scientifically honest.” 
She said it was prompted in part by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in January establishing a two-gender policy for the federal government.
Opponents of the bill raised concerns that it would discriminate against transgender and intersex North Dakotans.
Previously, the bill required all state-funded entities to refer to people by their sex determined at birth in all “policies, records, forms, rules, standards, procedures, guides, materials, instruction, training, correspondence, advertising, or marketing used by a public school, an institution under the control of the state board of higher education, or a state agency or office, unless otherwise required by federal law.”
The Senate Education Committee voted to remove this language because members felt it was confusing, Sen. Todd Beard, R-Williston, said on the floor.
He said the Century Code doesn’t usually state what kinds of forms or other legal documents definitions must apply to.
Since the bills were amended, they will go back to the House for concurrence votes.

(Getty Images)A legislative proposal to eliminate an exemption for tipped workers in the state’s minimum wage law met with broad opposition from business groups, restaurateurs, and workers Thursday.
Opponents of the bill, which was presented for a discussion only before an Assembly panel and did not see a vote, said the plan would force business closures, price hikes, and cuts to worker compensation by requiring businesses to pay the full minimum wage to workers even if their tips bring their hourly pay above the wage floor.
“As I always say, New Jersey is extremely expensive. We want to be able to support our small businesses, but by raising the cost of eating out and tipping workers and providing livable wages to these workers, we’re making it nearly impossible to do so,” said Elissa Frank, vice president of government affairs for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
New Jersey law sets the wage floor for most workers to $15.49, but affords employers a $9.87-per-hour credit against those wages if tips bring worker earnings above that level.
The bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer) would phase that credit down — to $7.90 in 2026, $5.92 in 2027, $3.95 in 2028, and $1.97 in 2029 — before entirely eliminating it beginning in 2030.
Reynolds-Jackson said the bill is “about economic justice.”

“Every person deserves to make a decent wage, and people should be paid fairly for the work they do. Today’s discussion is the start of a broader conversation as this bill makes its way through the legislative process. We look forward to meeting with stakeholders all around the state about this important issue,” she said.
Restaurant owners and business groups cautioned that eliminating tipped worker credits would force restaurants to raise prices or cut hours and jobs to meet payroll.
Some opponents noted that 73 restaurants closed last year in Washington, D.C., which is on a path to eliminate its tip credit by 2027. There are more than 2,600 restaurants in the nation’s capital, according to the National Restaurant Association.
“We’ve seen employees lose their jobs because the labor costs have increased astronomically,” said Amanda Stone, vice president of public affairs for the New Jersey Restaurant and Hospitality Association. “They’ve gone to areas outside of the district to continue being able to make a tipped wage. We’ve seen the real impact this can have right in D.C., and we can’t afford to do that here.”
Some workers themselves cautioned against a higher minimum wage, saying they had foregone promotions to management positions because of the additional earnings brought by tips. Others noted tips brought compensation for many to levels that far exceed the state’s wage floor.
“[I] went to school for hospitality and worked my way up into management. I’m back to bartending. I have always made more than minimum wage in service positions. They pulled my payroll, most recent pay period, I earned $44.42 an hour,” said Tricia Abbondanzo, a longtime restaurant worker. “This is not a minimum wage job.”
One witness supported eliminating tip wage credits over concerns about wage theft. A 2017 study from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, examining wage theft in 10 states found 17% of tip workers experienced some form of wage theft.
Wage theft can take different forms. In New Jersey, it can include employers taking a portion of tip pools or requiring their workers pool tips.
“The tipped industries have some of the highest rates of wage and hour violations behind only private residence domestic workers,” said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst for New Jersey Policy Perspective.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia law mandates that medical professionals treat newborns’ eyes with an ointment meant to prevent pink eye or potentially blindness if the baby comes into contact with bacteria or a sexually transmitted disease in the birthing canal.
The Senate narrowly approved a bill on Thursday repealing that guideline in state code, and the House of Delegates signed off on it earlier this month. While the bill doesn’t ban the use of the ointment, the potential removal of the mandate has raised concerns from medical professionals that it could lead to an increased rate of infant blindness.
“The people who are voting in favor of this bill are voting in favor of the blindness of babies,” said Dr. Nicole Bryce, an OBGYN resident at Charleston Area Medical Center. 
“There are very few things that are this inexpensive, this easy to administer that make such a huge difference in the lives of children,” she said. 
  Sen. Chris Rose, R-Monongalia
Sen. Chris Rose, R-Monongalia, voted for the bill saying, “This just gives parental rights [and] parental choice.”
Newborns receive erythromycin eye ointment after birth to prevent medical pink eye in the first month of life, and it has been the recommended standard of care for decades. It prevents a pinkeye infection from gonorrhea or other diseases that spread between sexual partners. If it’s not treated, newborn pinkeye from gonorrhea can cause blindness or life-threatening meningitis. 
Sen. Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha, who is a physician, told senators that, “nine out of 10 times women don’t know they’re infected” with gonorrhea. 
It is currently a misdemeanor crime if a provider doesn’t apply a topical solution on a newborn’s eyes. 
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, sponsored the measure, House Bill 3444. He said the code, enacted in 1923, was “outdated.”
“I am against codifying standards of care to providers,” Worrell said. “This decision should be between a provider and patient and not punishable by a misdemeanor and investigated as current code calls for.”
  Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
“I don’t expect [the] current process for newborns to change at all, just removing the code section,” he added. 
Bryce said she believed that pediatricians would still do their best to apply the ointment to newborns.
“It’s cheap and effective,” she said. “We can see significant damage to these children’s eyes in 24 to 48 hours, including blindness. The solution for that is to apply an ointment.”
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, raised concerns that the change could impact women in rural counties, where they may not have access to prenatal care. Women may not be educated on the use of ointment to give informed consent during birth, he said.
  Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson
“I don’t understand why we would risk our children being blind,” Garcia said. “I don’t see why we’re doing this bill.”
On Wednesday, Takubo tried to amend the bill to require a physician, midwife or others assisting in a birth to immediately administer the ointment on a newborn’s eyes.
“We could remove that and hope for the best or we could continue a well-established, safe procedure and protect children,” he said. 
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, opposed the amendment and said the standard of care would not change. She said that many mothers could treat their babies eyes “homeopathically” with breast milk.
  Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
“We have found that the overuse of antibiotics causes issues,” Rucker said. 
The amendment failed with a vote of 13 to 16 in the Senate. 
Bryce stressed that breast milk or colostrum, the first milk produced by a mother after birth, will not prevent blindness in babies that are affected by gonorrhea.
“Colostrum in no way shape or form can cure gonorrhea,” she said.
Ahead of the vote, Sen. Mike Woefel, D-Cabell, told senators that he opposed the bill, saying, “Freedom has a price.” 
“The parent has the freedom to say ‘I don’t want to put that medication in a child’s eye,’” he said. “But who pays for that if there’s blindness?”
The Senate approved the bill with a vote of 18-15. The House will have to concur with the Senate’s vote before the bill would head to Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s desk for consideration.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Thursday advanced a bill that could lead to the elimination of the state’s income tax, despite concerns that it benefitted the wealthy.
House Bill 1539 passed by a vote of 36-9 and returns to the House for consideration.
Under the measure, if revenue exceeds the fiscal year 2023 baseline of nearly $13.2 billion by $300 million, it will trigger a .25% tax cut beginning in budget year 2026.
The cut is expected to cost  $108.2 million, according to Senate staff and the Oklahoma Tax Commission.
If triggered in fiscal year 2027, the cost would be $272.5 million, according to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.
If there is no growth, the cut will not be triggered.
“It creates a pathway to the eventual elimination of the state income tax with guardrails in place to make sure there will be no tax rate cut during down economic years,” said Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, the Senate author.
Sen. Brent Howard, R-Altus, opposed the measure, saying he didn’t think enough thought went into the measure.
Taxing labor disincentivizes productivity, said Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, who voted for the bill.
“Taxing people’s wages is bad because it undermines liberty,” Deevers said. “It undermines people’s freedoms. If government controls income, then it controls your life.”
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, said it takes a simple majority in the Legislature to decrease taxes but a super majority to raise them. Voters in 1992 passed  State Question 640 putting restrictions on tax hikes.
The bill does not take into account additional services, such as education, that will be needed in the future, Boren said.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the bottom 20% in income might get back $15 while the top 1% will receive $6,000.
Oklahoma’s top income tax rate is 4.75%. Most Oklahomans fall into the top bracket.
Gov. Kevin Stitt has called for an income tax reduction with a path toward elimination.

(Photo courtesy of the Florida House of Representatives website)Gov. Ron DeSantis held a press conference Thursday during which he continued ripping into the Florida House, focusing on a proposal addressing rising condominium association fees.
The governor took the Senate’s side on dueling proposals that committees in neither chamber have heard in weeks, saying Miami Republican Rep. Vicki Lopez’s condo bill, HB 913, puts the interests of developers above that of residents.
“Legislative session only has a few more weeks left,” DeSantis said at the City of Sweetwater Community Center.
“There has not been meaningful action in the Florida House of Representatives to give Floridians relief from the condo crisis that the legislation itself has caused, and we’ve got to be willing to step up and do the right thing.”
Following the 2021 collapse in Surfside of a 12-story condo that killed 98 people, lawmakers passed legislation giving condos with three or more stories a Dec. 31, 2024, deadline to complete structural integrity reserve studies, to be repeated every 10 years, detailing how much a condominium association needs to save to pay for roof and structural maintenance.
One of the differences between the pending proposals is that Lopez wants to bar the state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp. from issuing or renewing policies for condominium buildings that haven’t completed their building inspections.
The Senate bill, SB 1742, sponsored by Fleming Island Republican Sen. Jenifer Bradley, would allow condo associations to invest money in reserve funds meant for repairs, whereas Lopez’s bill would allow them to take out loans to cover necessary repairs without requiring approval from association members.
Lopez told Florida Phoenix on Thursday that she hadn’t watched the press conference and that the lack of movement of the bills reflects that the chambers are working on a resolution.
“He should probably wait to see which condo bill actually passes from the House before he opines on it,” Lopez said.
Earlier this week, the governor held another press conference in Panama City Beach, during which he praised another Senate proposal on boating regulation while slamming the House for its inaction.
But on Thursday, he repeatedly thanked the wrong senator for the condo bill, saying Miami Republican Sen. Ileana Garcia was the sponsor instead of Bradley.
“I want to thank the folks in the Florida Senate who have moved credible legislation forward,” DeSantis said Thursday. “I don’t know what has gotten into the Florida House of Representatives.”
This isn’t the first time DeSantis has criticized Lopez. He publicly chastised her on X after she stopped the Florida Lottery’s Secretary John Davis from talking about immigration when he was supposed to brief new lawmakers about his agency and its work.

(Courtesy of Lucy Mason/The Gateway)LINCOLN —  Former Nebraska U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn is statistically tied with U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., in a new poll for a potential second run, according to Osborn’s exploratory committee. 
The poll of 524 likely midterm Nebraska voters shows Osborn trailing Ricketts by one percentage point, 45% to 46%, well within the survey’s 4.6 percentage point margin of error.

This comes after Osborn’s populist nonpartisan bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., made national headlines in 2024 for turning an expected safe seat into a potential upset. He raised $14 million and forced national Republicans to spend money in a reliably red state.
“This poll is encouraging and matches the frustration I hear every day from people across Nebraska,” Osborn said in a statement. “People are pissed off. They should be. Billionaires like Pete Ricketts and Elon Musk are taking a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, slashing jobs for 80,000 veterans.”
Osborn announced last week that he was exploring another run for the Senate, this time against Ricketts. Ricketts served two terms as governor before Gov. Jim Pillen. Ricketts, one of the most established figures in the Nebraska Republican Party, is running for a full six-year term after winning election in November to finish the final two years of former U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term. Pillen appointed Ricketts to the seat in early 2023.
Ricketts’ team responds
Jessica Flanagain, a political adviser for Ricketts, said Osborn used “fake polling to get media attention” during his bid against Fischer. Flanagain referred to a poll from last year that showed Osborn leading Fischer by roughly six percentage points. He lost to Fischer by about six percentage points. 
In recent elections, the reputation of political polling has taken a blow, as polls have missed the mark due to oversampling one party or not accurately representing all voters.
“Nebraskans solidly rejected Dan Osborn for his liberal positions,” Flanagain said. “Since November, it has come to light that Chuck Schumer and National Democrats spent millions to elect Dan Osborn, which means he has pledged to caucus with the Democrats.”
Many Democrats kept the registered nonpartisan at arm’s length until the campaign’s final days. The Senate Democrats’ main super PAC dropped more than $3.8 million into an outside group supporting Osborn.
A different kind of populist
Nebraska Republicans, including Fischer, have called Osborn a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. Osborn’s statement makes clear the steamfitter known for leading a strike at an Omaha Kellogg’s plant aims to contrast his working-class background with Ricketts, whose family owns the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball and started what became TD Ameritrade, which was later sold to Charles Schwab. 
Populism, whether Osborn’s approach or Trump’s, is a driving force in modern politics, as voters lose faith in institutions and seek alternatives. Local political observers have said the same working-class rhetoric that drove President Donald Trump’s victory could give Osborn an opening.

Political history suggests risk to the incumbent party during midterm elections, but Democrats bucked that trend and gained a firmer grip on the Senate in 2022. 
“Pete Ricketts has damn-near bought every politician in Nebraska, and he thinks he can buy our elections too,” Osborn said. “If I do this, he’s going to spend millions and millions of dollars going after me, spreading lies, even going after my family. That’s what they do.”
Ricketts has the dominant political operation in the state. Republicans who crossed him have lost seats, and his endorsement holds weight. His endorsed candidate for governor, Pillen, defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2022, Charles Herbster.
He and his supporters have also funded outside groups that attack the candidates he opposes. Ricketts defeated Democrat Preston Love Jr. by 22 percentage points in November, a race in which Flanagain said Ricketts “earned the most votes in state history.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature overturned the governor’s veto of a bill that opens state and county health officials to civil action for decisions about quarantines and takes away their authority to ban public gatherings in situations of infectious disease.
Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed Senate Bill 29, but the veto was overridden Thursday by the Senate and House. There was little discussion in the Senate, but multiple representatives spoke out against the bill in the House.

“I want to speak on behalf of public health departments, and I’ve heard from several,” said Rep. Barbara Ballard, a Democrat from Lawrence. “Whenever there’s a major catastrophe or something else happens, it’s public health departments that respond.”
Others shared their personal experiences with measles when they were young.
“My big concern is with the measles outbreak in southwest Kansas,” said Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Wichita. “I was a kid in kindergarten, and everybody got the measles. That’s what we did before vaccines. It’s a horrible disease. People talk about the deaths, but it’s more than that. There were horrible side effects. I had a lot of ear infections. Fortunately for me, mine went away. I knew other kids that had problems with their ears their whole lives. Other kids, they became developmentally disabled because of the measles. It scares me that a disease we once eradicated is coming back in southwest Kansas.”
In a press release about her veto, Kelly said that SB 29 puts Kansans at unnecessary risk.
“I will not sign legislation that hampers public health professionals’ ability to take reasonable, measured steps to limit the spread of dangerous infections and protect the health of the communities they are entrusted to serve,” she said.
Sen. Beverly Gossage, R-Eudora, disagreed with assumptions in the governor’s assessment.
“The governor stated in the veto that it would prohibit issuing quarantines, which is not really true. They may issue quarantines or institute isolation,” Gossage said. “It’s just that before taking that action they must have probable cause. It also allows the aggrieved party to file a civil action and that that be acted upon within 72 hours if someone is wrongfully put into isolation or quarantine.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4090577-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-10 16:10:01.628106

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate Thursday approved a nearly $10 billion education budget for 2026.
SB 112, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would increase the education budget by $543.3 million, a 5.81% increase, totaling $9.89 billion for the fiscal year that starts October 1. The main budget includes increased funding for specific programs, like the Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI).
Orr said after the vote that he hoped the budget would move fast through the nine days remaining in the 2025 session.
“I would hope we won’t even have to go to conference, but I’ve also been around here too long to know that there’s always something that pops up,” he said. “That’s the goal, if the House passed version is acceptable up here, that we concur and we move on.”

The budget includes $9.6 million to support a newly enacted parental leave policy for state and education staff and $15.6 million designated for an employee injury compensation program, which still needs final legislative passage. The budget also sets aside $2.5 million for a pilot program offering school-based teletherapy (mental health counseling via phone or video) and enhances prison education funding by $3.7 million (a 19.3% increase) to $22.8 million.
“If you’re out for three months because you wrenched your ankle on a pothole in this school parking lot, walking to the gym or something. There was nothing for you. You’re out,” Orr said.
Significant increases are proposed for specific initiatives: the AMSTI would see a 31% ($32.2 million) funding increase while the Alabama Reading Initiative’s (ARI) funding would grow by 6.4% ($9 million). Transportation funding is also slated for a boost of about 9.1%, about $40 million. Orr said AMSTI’s funding is significantly higher because the program is still being implemented, whereas the AIR program started nearly three years before and is fully implemented.
The state’s contribution towards employee health insurance is also set to rise. PEEHIP’s contribution per education employee will increase from $800 to $904, and SEIB’s contribution per state employee will rise to $1,025, up from $997.
The Senate passed SB 113, sponsored by Orr, which adds $524.3 million in supplemental funding for the current fiscal year ending September 30. This includes $100 million for local school boards to purchase new buses and $166 million for the State Department of Education for non-recurring costs like college and career readiness grants and extra school safety training.
Senators also approved SB 111, also sponsored by Orr and passed by the Senate. It would allocate $375 million over three years to transition to a new hybrid student funding model, aiming to provide more funds to students with greater needs, such as those in poverty or learning English.
Higher education institutions could also receive extra money in the supplemental budget, which was done to keep the typical funding balance between K-12 and higher education after the $375 million for the K-12 funding formula changes
Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, seemed concerned about college funding, particularly for smaller and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). He questioned the allocation of funds to innovation centers, which provide workforce training, suggesting these programs might be drawing funding away from institutions struggling to maintain their infrastructure, pointing specifically to Miles College.
“I know that is a private school, but Miles has been parked at that $493,000 for some years. It couldn’t be rounded up at least 500,000?” Singleton jokingly asked.
Orr said that “we’ll see what we can do next year.”
The Alabama Community College System Innovation Center in Decatur is slated to receive $17 million under SB 112.
SB 114, another Orr-sponsored supplemental bill, would allocate $1.25 billion from the Education Trust Fund Advancement and Technology Fund for the current fiscal year. Approximately $908 million would be directed to the Department of Education for distribution to local school boards and other state education bodies like the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind and the Department of Youth Services School Districts.
The Senate also approved separate funding measures for Tuskegee University ($15.8 million), Talladega College ($1.33 million), and Southern Preparatory Academy ($450,000).
The bills now move to the House for consideration.

DeAnn Vaught (center) and Energy and Environment Sec. Shane Khoury appear before the House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development committee on April 10, 2025 to speak in favor of Senate Bill 290. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)New amendments to a bill that environmental advocates feared would endanger a moratorium on large animal farms in the Buffalo River watershed helped the legislation advance from a House committee on Thursday.
In a reversal, the secretaries of the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment and the Department of Agriculture said negotiations with Senate Bill 290’s House sponsor and the governor’s office yielded amendments they said will protect the existing moratorium.
SB 290 is sponsored by Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, and Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning. 
The watershed moratorium, which has been in place for 10 years, quickly emerged at the beginning of the legislative session as a flashpoint between the environmentalists who fought for the ban in the first place and agricultural interests who said it infringed on private property rights.
“It’s going to preserve the existing ones that are there,” Vaught said of the newly amended legislation. “The moratoriums going from this point forward, it establishes a clear process and procedure for our adoption of any implemented new moratoriums in the state of Arkansas.”
Energy and Environment Sec. Shane Khoury told the House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development Committee Thursday there were three things everyone could agree on: the importance of agriculture to the state’s economy, that tourism is also a large economic driver, and that the Buffalo River deserves “heightened protection.”
“I’ve always believed that these things are not mutually exclusive, that we can do all things we need to do at the same time. We can recognize the significance of agriculture, we can encourage tourism, and we can protect the Buffalo, all at the same time,” Khoury said. “In fact, I think we’ve been doing that for the past ten years; this amendment allows us to continue to do all of these things.”
SB 290 was introduced at the end of February and finally passed the Senate last week. When it was heard in the House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development Committee Tuesday, members pushed it to the full House by a narrow margin, before Vaught pulled it from the floor in order to make it more “palatable” Wednesday night.
Vaught said she didn’t have much involvement with the form the legislation took when it was moving through the Senate, but said she participated in negotiations once it reached the House.
“Yesterday, we had a meeting where we spoke with the governor for a good while,” Vaught said after the House committee voted to move the amended bill back to the House floor without audible opposition. “I got to give her my concerns about farmers that are already existing within the Buffalo River, and I want those farmers to be protected … and then she wanted to be able to protect the Buffalo River.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said repeatedly that she does not support legislation that does not protect the watershed.
“This revised bill is the result of our valuable partnership with Senator Johnson and Representative Vaught and achieves our goal of both protecting the Buffalo National River and supporting Arkansas farmers, whose success is critical to our state,” said Sam Dubke, Sanders’ spokesperson, in a written statement.
The amendments add language exempting existing moratoriums from the proposed legislation — keeping the existing moratoriums for the Buffalo River watershed and the Lake Maumelle watershed in place, while making the Legislature a bigger part of the process if another moratorium becomes necessary in the future by keeping in place language for approval of future moratoriums that was introduced while it was in a Senate committee.
“With the new version, we’re definitely going to keep it [the existing moratorium] in place, so I don’t foresee there being any future looks at the Buffalo River,” Vaught said, describing the changes as “a great compromise.”
“We should want to protect something that’s so pristine,” Vaught added.
Previous versions of SB 290 sparked strong opposition from environmental groups, who feared those versions, if passed, would end up eliminating the permit moratorium, and again allow another facility like C&H Hog Farms to open up shop in the watershed, endangering the Buffalo National River. The state of Arkansas spent $6.2 million to buy out the farm and shut it down in 2019, after years of efforts led by groups such as the Buffalo River Watershed Alliance.
The president of the Ozark Society, another environmental group that has been opposed to SB290, declined to comment on Thursday’s passage, saying it was too early to do so.
Multiple people spoke against the bill before the committee last week, urging lawmakers to protect “the jewel” of the state of Arkansas. 
Richard Johnson, of Little Rock, said the moratorium needed to remain in place, citing pollution hazards posed by swine CAFOs, or concentrated animal feed operations.
“They tend to pollute way beyond their footprint,” Johnson said.
The moratorium was first put in place a decade ago by the Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Protection’s (DEQ) predecessor, in response to public outcry over the C&H Hog Farms in the watershed. Environmental advocates said the runoff from the operation was polluting the watershed, which contains the nation’s first, and Arkansas’ only, national river — although advocates for farmers like Vaught and Arkansas Farm Bureau said that was not true.

“What’s happening in North Carolina goes beyond state borders,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told reporters. “If Republicans are successful in changing the rules post-election and throwing away valid votes, this will have broad implications, serious repercussions, on elections across the country for years to come.”
State and national Democrats held their news conference nearly a week after the state Appeals Court sided with Griffin over the state Board of Elections in his attempt to toss more than 60,000 votes in his race to win an associate justice seat on the high court. 
He is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who holds a 734-vote lead. Her lead was confirmed in two recounts. 
Asked if Republicans planned to use the strategy in other states, state GOP spokesman Matt Mercer called the question’s premise “ridiculous” in an email. 
After Griffin’s Appeals Court win last week, Mercer sent out a statement calling it a vindication of Griffin’s election integrity protests. 
A 2-1 Republican majority on the Appeals Court panel agreed with Griffin that the elections board should not have counted more than 60,000 votes from people who did not have a partial Social Security number or driver’s license number attached to their registration in the state database. 
Voters have come forward over the last four months to say that they supplied information, but it was not in the database due to typos or data mismatches. 
Overseas and military absentee voters have not been required to submit photo ID with their ballots. The state Board of Elections should not have exempted those voters from the state photo ID requirement, the Appeals Court decision said. Griffin is challenging more than 5,500 of those voters in a handful of heavily Democratic counties. 
The Appeals Courts said voters who have never lived in North Carolina but are connected to the state through their parents do not have the right to vote in non-federal elections. Griffin is challenging a few hundred of those voters. 
The elections board and Riggs are appealing to the state Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a majority. Three of the six justices who would hear the case have in previous court opinions supported some of Griffin’s arguments. 
North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton called Griffin’s lawsuits “a fundamental attack on our democracy.”
State Democrats and the DNC are “preparing for every scenario possible” to make sure votes are counted, she said. 
Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake) is lead sponsor of a bill that would prevent throwing out the ballots of voters who relied on laws in effect during the election. It would also invalidate challenges based on technical or clerical registration form errors, unless the protester shows the voter was ineligible. 
Republicans hold a majority in the House, so the bill is unlikely to get a hearing. 
Rubin acknowledges that it is “obviously an uphill climb,” but said it was important to file the bill. 
“We wrote this bill as a model that I hope other states will take up,” he said. “There is no reason to think that these tactics will be limited to North Carolina.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Griffin-and-Riggs.jpg,,,2025-04-10 16:10:01.628106

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Critics of a proposed constitutional amendment that could open the state’s primary elections have asked the Oklahoma Supreme Court to toss it out.
The Oklahoma Republican Party and Ronda Vuillemont-Smith, former chair of the Tulsa County Republican Party, sued on Wednesday, the last day of the protest period, to block  State Question 836.
Their lawsuit alleges the petition violates “the U.S. Constitution by forcing political parties to unwillingly associate with political candidates in violation of the First Amendment rights of political parties’ and their members.”
The suit alleges the ballot title and gist of the petition are misleading and insufficient.
The proposed state question seeks to open  Oklahoma primaries to all voters. Under the proposal, the top two vote getters would advance to the general election, regardless of political affiliation. Voters would only be able to choose one candidate for each office.
Presidential elections would be unaffected.
Supporters of State Question 836 need 172,993 signatures to get the measure on a future ballot.
The lawsuit alleges that if the state question passes, not only would anyone be able vote for any candidate, they could  register and run under any party’s banner, without a nomination or endorsement.
It violates the petitioners’ First Amendment associational rights, the suit said.
The proposal is a radical change to Oklahoma elections, the suit said. That change is not adequately disclosed in the gist and ballot title, the suit said.
“This challenge is not about the law – it’s about control,” said Margaret Kobos, founder of Oklahoma United, a nonprofit backing State Question 836. “Oklahomans are tired of decisions being made in low-turnout primaries in which they can’t even cast a vote.
“State Question 836 threatens a system that benefits only entrenched insiders at taxpayer expense, and so it’s unsurprising they’re doing everything they can to stop it.”

(Photo courtesy of University of West Florida)Before facing a state Senate vote on his confirmation, controversial University of West Florida Board of Trustees Chair Scott Yenor has resigned from his position. 
In his resignation notice, he indicated that opposition from “a group within Florida’s Senate,” led to his immediate departure. 
Yenor, a professor in Idaho, faced backlash for proclaiming that LGBTQ+ practices bring “dreaded diseases” and labeling career-oriented women “medicated, meddlesome, and quarrelsome.” The bipartisan Jewish legislative caucus has called Yenor “antisemitic.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis stood by his appointee but Sen. Don Gaetz, whose district includes the campus, told WEAR News his office has received “thousands of emails and letters and texts and visits, and not one single person expressed support for Mr. Yenor.”
Other members of the board have faced their first of three confirmation hearings. The Senate, Sen. Gayle Harrell said Thursday during a hearing by the Appropriations Committee on Higher Education, is “closely watching” the board of trustees.
Senate panel not impressed by Heritage fellow nominated to UWF board

In December and January, eight new trustees joined the UWF board, five nominated by DeSantis and three by the Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System. Seven, Yenor aside, have faced questions from the Senate about their beliefs, three most recently on Thursday.
Unaware of his comments
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith asked the three in front of the committee to defend their votes for Yenor as chair.
Chris Young, an attorney from Panama City, told Smith he regretted voting for Yenor and said he had been unaware of his comments. 
Paul Bailey, an attorney and a professor at Pensacola Christian College, said he, too had been unaware. “In hindsight, if I had the knowledge I have now, I would not have voted for him,” he said. 
Gates Garcia, a private equity CEO from Tampa, said he voted for Yenor’s “track record in education reform.” He also said he was not aware of Yenor’s comments. 
Senators questioned how he  could not have known, considering they are a focus of Yenor’s educational philosophy and how widely they have been publicized. 
Yenor has advocated for fewer women in higher education and said if only men won the Nobel Prize, “that’s not a failure. It’s kind of a cause for celebration,” The Associated Press reported.
“I hope that you really understand the reluctance this committee has had in some of the comments that have been made and the sentiment of the former chair of the [trustees], and we will be carefully watching the board of trustees at the University of West Florida,” Harrell said, addressing Garcia.
All three received favorable support.
‘Hard to believe’
Smith, the only Democrat present at the meeting, cast the sole vote against each of trustees, although Sens. Jennifer Bradley and Alexis Calatayud encouraged Garcia to elaborate further on his beliefs during his next hearing before the Senate Ethics and Elections committee.
“I will be voting ‘no’ on all of the UWF appointees, because each of these appointees voted for former chair Yenor,” Smith said. 
“We already know what those controversial comments were. I find it very hard to believe that these individuals were not aware of what these comments were, given how highly publicized they were, and, ultimately, at the end of the day, if you don’t stand for something, then you’ll fall for anything.”
Harrell and former UWF President Judith Bense raised concerns about the lack of local connections by board members.

Another member of the board, Adam Kissel, drew an unfavorable recommendation from the Senate committee earlier this session; final approval will be up to the entire Senate. 
Senators criticized Kissel’s advocacy for defunding of public universities and suggesting the GI bill led to over-enrolled four-year colleges. 
The seeming takeover attempt at UWF resembles the now-conservative focused New College’s a few years ago, although the Panhandle institution and lawmakers are pushing back. 
“I think it’s incredibly important for our state university system for trustees to be able to express the rejection of ideology that does not move our system forward, and also as they set a vision, particularly after the voting process, and now the removal of former chair Yenor,” Calatayud said Thursday.

Laura Kelly's veto of a bill setting the stage for possible reduction of state income tax rates.,"Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, urged colleagues in the Kansas Legislature to support the override of Gov. Laura Kelly's veto of a bill that could trigger reductions in the state's individual income tax rates. The House and Senate voted to defeat Kelly's veto on Senate Bill 125. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA —Republican Sen. Caryn Tyson and Democratic Sen. Ethan Corson locked horns Thursday in a debate about override Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of legislation creating an automatic mechanism that would dedicate excess revenue to lowering state income tax rates.
“I can’t understand why anybody would veto this or not support this effort and stop our government growth,” Tyson said before the Senate voted 30-10 to override the governor. The GOP-dominated House later produced the two-thirds majority — 87-37 — necessary to complete the rejection of Kelly’s veto.
Corson, in response to Tyson, said he was frustrated the Legislature passed a bill that locked in future income tax reductions despite not fulfilling a pledge to substantively address property taxes during the 2025 session.
“Where is the property tax relief?” said Corson, who voted with Democrats to support Kelly’s veto. “It’s a double whammy for folks expecting their property tax relief. We’re not going to give it to you this session and we’re not going to be able to give it to you in future sessions.”
Tyson’s response: “We always don’t get what we want right away.”
Kelly set the table for debate on Senate Bill 269 by the Senate and House after concluding the tax legislation could push Kansas off a financial cliff just as aggressive income tax cuts signed into law by Gov. Sam Brownback did more than a decade ago.
“The income tax cuts made possible by this bill could cost the state up to $1.3 billion annually,” Kelly said. “The triggers for those tax cuts are such that as soon as the state sees an uptick in revenue, taxes will be automatically cut regardless of any other economic factors or policy and budgetary considerations. We’ve been down this road before, and we can’t afford to go back to failed tax experiments and policies that will stifle economic opportunity for everyday Kansans.”
Under the Senate bill, reductions in state income tax rates would be contingent on the balance in the state’s rainy-day fund. The measure would require the state budget director to annually determine whether the preceding fiscal year’s state general fund tax receipts exceeded the 2024 total after adjustments for inflation. This calculation would be done by Aug. 15 starting in 2025.
The Kansas Department of Revenue would determine whether reductions to the state income tax could be authorized. The bill required both individual income tax rates in Kansas — 5.2% for lower-income individuals and 5.58% for upper-income individuals — to be reduced proportionally until the lower bracket hit 4%. At that point, the upper bracket rate would be gradually sliced until that also reached 4%.
If this process went as planned by Republican legislators, the state would wind up with a single-rate individual income tax sought by Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins. Both touted benefits of SB 269, and were critical of the governor’s veto of the bill.
“Last year, the governor held tax relief hostage over phony claims it would hurt revenues,” the GOP leaders said in a statement. “This year, she vetoes a bill with no fiscal note. SB 269 is a simple concept that lowers the cost of living by delivering responsible income tax relief. When tax revenues come in higher than expected, your taxes go down automatically — a sensible way to return tax dollars to Kansans that only Governor Kelly could oppose.”
Hawkins and Masterson offered a summary of political distinctions arising from the bill: “It’s clear, her real allegiance is to growing government on your dime. Republicans stand with taxpayers.”
House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, said the backdoor imposition of a flat tax would place a disproportionately high burden on lower-income Kansans at a “significant financial cost to the state.”
“We’ve seen reckless tax experiments like this one in the past, and we know the consequences. This legislation would bankrupt our state,” Woodard said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132241-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:44:26.428887

As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.



Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Kim Reynolds and members of her cabinet oversaw parts of northwest Iowa impacted by flooding in a helicopter tour June 21, 2024. (Photo courtesy of Gov. Kim Reynolds' office)Gov. Kim Reynolds’ bill making changes to Iowa’s disaster relief assistance programs is on its way to the Iowa Senate floor after approval Thursday by the chamber’s Ways and Means Committee.
Senate File 619 has already received approval from the Senate Local Government and Appropriations committees. The bill follows up on some of the measures put in place for disaster recovery by Reynolds following the 2024 floods and tornadoes that impacted more than 5,000 homes across the state.
The measure includes an appropriation of $13.6 million from the Iowa Economic Emergency Fund retroactively for fiscal year 2025 with the majority of funding going toward home rehabilitation programs and $2 million to the Nuisance Property and Abandoned Building Fund, used to tear down buildings that cannot be repaired.
This funding was discussed with lawmakers during the summer of 2024 as Reynolds rolled out the state’s disaster response and recovery plans. The bill’s appropriation for housing rehabilitation will go toward to the State Disaster Recovery New Housing Grant and Disaster Recovery Housing Assistance programs, launched in July. The governor’s bill also includes a proposal to extend tax exclusions for developers who build new housing in disaster-impacted areas.

The measure also establishes new programs and funds that the governor said will help the state more quickly respond to natural disasters in the future. It would establish a new loan program, the Natural Hazard Mitigation Financing program, led by the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the Iowa Finance Authority, with funding available to eligible entities for “ongoing risk mitigation” projects to better prepare Iowa communities for future severe weather.
Molly Severn, legislative liaison for the governor’s office, said the measure will help “make it easier for Iowans to get the help they need as soon as possible” during natural disasters.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and some advocates have expressed support for the bill’s steps to streamline the disaster assistance process and provide funding in previous meetings. However, there was some pushback at the Senate subcommittee meeting Thursday from lobbyists with insurance organizations and public insurance adjusters on one portion of the bill — a requirement for appraisers, independent adjusters and umpires to be licensed to assess property damages.
During the process of receiving insurance coverage following a natural disaster, multiple assessments are made. A public insurance adjuster, representing the policy holder, and a private insurance adjuster representing the insurance company, typically both review a damaged property’s value and assessing the claim made. Umpires are the neutral party in this process, meant to serve as an unbiased source while assessing damages and value. But Reynolds said licensure and regulations were needed to “better protect consumers and homeowners from unfair practices” during the process.
Dennis Tibben with the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters said most other states regulate umpires and independent adjusters through contracts instead of through the licensing processes set up in the bill.
“If enacted, Iowa would have the most restrictive, expansive licensure type in the nation,” Tibben said. “And we expect that that will have a chilling effect on the number of individuals who are independent, who will serve as the arbitrators when a public insurance adjuster, who serves as an advocate on behalf of the insured individual, and their insurance company can’t come to an initial resolution on the insurance plan.”
Tibben said this provision could lead to fewer umpires and independent adjusters practicing in Iowa, which could leave Iowans with longer wait times for their insurance claims to be processed.
Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, said in the subcommittee meeting he wanted to learn more about the impacts of licensure on insurance costs and processing people’s claims after disasters, but he supported the bill moving forward as he said it made improvements to Iowa’s disaster relief and recovery programs.
He also supported the bill later Thursday as it was unanimously approved by the Ways and Means committee, praising the governor and her staff for their work on the bill.
“It’s my understanding that this isn’t something that just was thrown together,” Dotzler said. “It’s been worked on for considerable amount of time, and really is a proactive approach that would help people in real time.”
Sen. David Rowley, R-Spirit Lake, said the bill will improve Iowa’s disaster response efforts.
“All of us have been affected by floods, tornadoes, derechos, all of these disasters — hail storms, anything that comes through — it creates a disastrous effect on these communities,” Rowley said. “We need to address it. We need to be faster than we have been in the past. This allows those dollars to flow forward.”
The bill is now available for debate in the full Iowa Senate, and its companion, House File 982, is available for consideration in the House.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Surrounded by shelves packed with books, journals and ledgers detailing centuries of state government history, high school students gathered in the Rhode Island State Library Wednesday to talk about the history they think is missing in their classrooms. 
They came to support a bill by Providence Democratic Rep. David Morales that would require public high schools statewide to offer a full-year ethnic studies course starting in the 2026-2027 school year. Beginning with the class of 2030, the course would be a graduation requirement. 
“Providence is very diverse. America is a very diverse country, where people of all different backgrounds come to live here,” Milia Odom, an 11th grader at Central High School and youth organizer with the Alliance of RI Southeast Asians (ARISE) and OurSchoolsPVD, told a few dozen people in attendance. “A whole lot of people deserve to know where they come from. They deserve to know where their parents come from, and they deserve to know their history.”
Morales’ name may be on the bill introduced Feb. 28, but he said the students drafted it.
“I just want to reiterate that it was the young people that made that happen,” Morales said, noting that the kids have allies on the school board, in the Providence City Council and at the State House.  “But at the end of the day, this work is only happening because it is the young people who are pushing us as lawmakers to make these changes happen.”
The bill text describes a basic curriculum consisting of U.S. and Rhode Island history with a focus on “the experiences of racialized communities,” including Black, Indigenous, Latin American, Asian American, Pacific Islander and Arab American communities. The Armenian Genocide is also listed as an element of the courses, which would fall under social studies. Students would also be required to complete a civics project that would highlight their ability to “reason, make logical arguments and support claims using valid evidence,” the bill reads.
The bill would create a council of student leaders to advise the curriculum building process, with a student representative and teacher from each school district. The school district’s superintendent and a number of “youth-led” organizations would select the representatives, per the bill text.  
If enacted, the legislation would become effective July 1, and the student leadership council would begin meeting in October. 
The OurSchoolsPVD coalition, which organized Wednesday’s event, succeeded in getting the Providence School Board to authorize a similar, nonbinding resolution last year. The Providence City Council passed a resolution in support of the new bill last week.    
“Rhode Island, as a ‘Lively Experiment’, has been and is home to communities of every description,” Council President Rachel Miller wrote in her resolution.
Miller was not there, but Providence City Council President Pro Tempore Juan M. Pichardo attended the event and gave remarks.

Compared to last year’s school board resolution, Morales’ bill enlarges a municipal goal to a statewide one. The bill leaves room for school districts to design the requisite course in a way that fits their communities. The state education department would provide guidance on the content of these courses, and would assist in “expand[ing] diverse educator pipelines to support with the delivery of ethnic studies,” according to the bill.
As of October 2023, students of color comprised 81% of students enrolled in public schools in Central Falls, Pawtucket, Providence, and Woonsocket, according to analysis of state data by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT. Statewide, white students accounted for 51% of the entire K-12 population, Hispanic students 30% and Black students 9%. Multi-racial, Asian, Pacific Islander and Native American students made up about 10%.   
Angel Solis, a Central High School graduate who now attends the Community College of Rhode Island, pointed to his own positive experience with an ethnic studies class in his junior year of high school. He said lessons on the resilience of Latin and Native American communities in the face of colonization made him more curious and openminded.
That helped Solis repair blindspots in his knowledge about his own and others’ heritage, he said. 
“When I was a sophomore, I had little general knowledge about what ethnic studies were…Over time, the more I figured out, the more I asked myself, ‘Why don’t we have it?’” Solis recounted.
Jesslynn Melendez, an East Providence High School senior and an OurSchoolsPVD youth leader, thought ethnic studies could help repair negative perceptions about certain ethnic groups for all students.
Having ethnic studies, Melendez said, could foster a “community where students will know the hardships of certain cultures and groups, [and] how saying certain things or suggesting certain things aren’t a joke, but harmful.” 
Nine Democrats joined Morales in co-sponsoring the bill. Morales said a Senate version is in the works, with Sen. Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, as lead sponsor. 
The bill has not yet been scheduled for a hearing before the House Committee on Education. 
“Decades from now, when y’all have children and they’re taking an ethnic studies course, you can let them know Mom was on the front line fighting for this bill to become law,” Morales said.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
Public debate
Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.












It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician




From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
Making the connection
Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

The distance requirement between shelters and schools would apply to municipalities with less than 300,000 residents. 
There was no “do pass” motion in the House County and Municipal Government Committee for Senate Bill 474 Wednesday, meaning the measure remains with the committee rather than advancing to an oversight panel.
Rep. Tim Turner, R-Kinta, asked why medical marijuana dispensaries and a registered sex offender should be allowed closer to a school than a homeless shelter. Sex offenders cannot “loiter” within 500 feet of a school, this bill would have required homeless shelters to be six times as far. 
He also asked why this bill targeted municipalities with specific populations rather than the whole state. Only Oklahoma City and Tulsa have populations greater than 300,000 residents, according to the most recent census data.
“A sex offender is being monitored by law enforcement,” said Rep. Kevin West, R-Moore, the House author of the bill. “And generally speaking, they also probably have a job so they’re doing something during the day, not always, but sometimes. … But what this does is it gives a safety barrier zone between a homeless shelter and a school. We know that a lot of the harm reduction services are done at shelters, that’s also where we’re finding all kinds of needles and other paraphernalia, so I don’t personally feel like just barely over half a mile is too much to ask for this.”
West said he’s worked closely with the city of Norman over concerns with the location of its homeless shelter, but to his knowledge no specific community requested the bill. 
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said she was glad to see the bill did not advance. 
“The misconception is that those who experience homelessness are just in the metro area, and that’s just not true,” she said Thursday. “People are needing housing, and there’s housing shortages all across the state of Oklahoma, especially after the pandemic. And so I’m glad to know that that bill was defeated by a bipartisan effort saying we’re gonna let our local communities … make those decisions to take care of their local communities, regardless of the size of their community.”
The measure narrowly passed through the Senate 26-20, with critics voicing similar concerns.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who supports Hughes’ program, was the lone “no” vote. That was because the committee didn’t immediately restore a requirement that DHHS administer the program. 
Six committee members last week voted to amend the law to say DHHS “may” create the program, instead of “shall.”
Cavanaugh said the committee needed to fully fix its mistake, not partially, and that a mandate was critical, particularly for DHHS. She served on the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee for the past six years where she said leaders sometimes skirted permissively written laws.
With support from State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk, the committee fully restored the program by a show of at least five hands.
State Sens. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha and Rob Clements of Elmwood, committee chair, did not take a position on restoring the program.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who led 2024 and 2025 legislation to create the program, said she was “very happy” after the reversal. She’s identified her Legislative Bill 1035 in 2024, and LB 10 earlier this year, as her proudest accomplishments in her three years as a senator.
“Best day ever!!!” she said in a text.
LB 10, from Hughes, passed March 6 to get around a decade-old federal law that prevented the program from getting off the ground. It included language from the Governor’s Office authorizing DHHS to receive and dispense donated medicines or supplies to anyone impacted by a governor-declared state of emergency. LB 1035, passed last spring, created the program.
The SafeNetRx program tailors its services to individuals who can’t afford prescribed medication, regardless of insurance status, with an annual household income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, which is roughly $64,300 a year for a family of four.
Nebraskans can already donate to SafeNetRx where staff have multiple inspections to check whether meds are:

Sealed in tamper-evident packaging.
Non-expired.
Non-controlled substances.

Pharmacists also confirm that donated medicines do not require refrigeration and show no signs of tampering or deterioration.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Tuesday’s latest deadline in the Washington Legislature provided the last rites for numerous proposals tackling everything from penalties for environmental crimes to union bargaining over artificial intelligence.
But with just a few weeks left in the legislative session, just about all of the big-ticket items lawmakers are considering remain alive.
Bills to cap residential rent increases, deal with the rights of parents with children in public schools, require a state permit to purchase a gun, mandate clergy report child abuse, overhaul the recycling system and allow striking workers to access unemployment benefits all remain in play. 
Legislators in the House and Senate will now work to pass proposals from the opposite chamber off their floors. Their deadline to pass measures from the other chamber is next Wednesday.
Proposals that affect state revenue are exempt from the deadlines as they are considered necessary to implement the budget. Lawmakers can also use more creative ways to save bills. 
The session is scheduled to end April 27. 
Here are some notable bills that lawmakers gave what will likely be their final death knell. 
Inclusivity in schools
Democratic lawmakers looked to expand protections for students from discrimination in Washington’s public schools.
Senate Bill 5123 would have added protections for ethnicity, homelessness, immigration status and neurodivergence. It also would have established new classes to specifically defend against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity. 
The measure, sponsored by Sen. T’wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, didn’t make it out of the House Appropriations committee.
Artificial intelligence
House Bill 1622 would have required public employers to bargain with unions over the use of artificial intelligence if it affects worker wages or performance evaluations.
Opponents, including business groups and city officials, said the measure would skew the balance of power between employees and managers too far toward workers.
The Senate Ways & Means Committee did not advance the bill Tuesday. Rep. Lisa Parshley, D-Olympia, plans to fine-tune the legislation and bring it back next year. 
“We have to jump on it,” she said.
Competency restoration
House Bill 1218 sought to, among other things, establish an incentive program for cities and counties to reduce referrals to state hospitals for inpatient treatment of criminal defendants who are mentally ill. 
The measure, originally requested by then-Gov. Jay Inslee, came in light of a long-standing court order pushing the state to more quickly get people evaluated and admitted for competency restoration treatment. The bill sought to reduce the number of people coming into state care and instead get them into local programs. 
After passing the House along largely party lines, a state Senate policy committee “effectively gutted” the bill, said sponsor Rep. Darya Farivar, D-Seattle. 
“We saw pretty quickly that there was a fundamental difference of opinion” with the Senate, between tackling the problem on the front end or by addressing it simply through more state beds for involuntary treatment, she said.
This bill also lapsed in the Ways & Means Committee. Farivar plans to work on the legislation and revive it next year.
Rent fixing 
Legislation looked to ban algorithmic price fixing by prohibiting the collection of data that feeds recommendations for rental rates. 
Senate Bill 5469 would have also barred landlords from obtaining those recommendations. This practice, led by software company RealPage, reportedly helped price an estimated 800,000 leases in Washington between 2017 and 2024.
But after state Attorney General Nick Brown filed a lawsuit on the issue against RealPage last week, “there was less motivation to move the bill forward, pending the outcome of that lawsuit,” its sponsor, Sen. Jesse Salomon, D-Shoreline, said in a statement.
Supply chain
Senate Bill 5649 would have created a new program to provide grants and loans to ports to keep Washington’s supply chain on par with competitors. 
The Senate passed it unanimously, but it stalled in a House committee.  Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, the bill’s author, said he hopes the provisions could be included in a final transportation budget.
“With President Trump’s tariffs already disrupting global trade, it’s critical that we ensure Washington’s supply chain remains competitive,” he said.
Environmental crimes
And legislation looking to strengthen criminal penalties against corporations responsible for environmental crimes has stalled in the House. 
Advocates hoped Senate Bill 5360 would have served as a deterrent against violating state clean air, clean water and hazardous waste laws, and bring the state into alignment with federal punishments. Supporters said increased penalties were needed immediately given the Trump administration’s overhaul of the Environmental Protection Agency that they say will result in less environmental protections. Opponents argued it went too far.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9085-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

Ron DeSantis denied Thursday that a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation that was part of an agreement with health care giant Centene over Medicaid payments was illegal and called it a &#8220;cherry on top&#8221; instead. The settlement agreement, signed Sept. 27, 2024, was not disclosed to the Florida Legislature. Leading House [&#8230;]","Screenshot from the Florida Channel of First Lady Casey DeSantis distributing a check to members of Vision of Hope in Panama City Beach on May 9, 2024.Gov. Ron DeSantis denied Thursday that a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation that was part of an agreement with health care giant Centene over Medicaid payments was illegal and called it a “cherry on top” instead.
The settlement agreement, signed Sept. 27, 2024, was not disclosed to the Florida Legislature. Leading House Republicans suggested the payment to the foundation, championed by First Lady Casey DeSantis, could be illegal because it wasn’t disclosed as required by state law.
“First of all, this was a settlement,” DeSantis told reporters in Miami. “It was a good deal that was negotiated. When you do settlements, you can try to get as much money as you can, but this was in addition to what they were getting. This is kind of like a cherry on top, where they agreed to make an additional contribution, and so we were served well by what AHCA did.”
The $10 million payment, described in the agreement as a “one time donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation, was included in a $67 million settlement agreement between Centene and the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and the Attorney General’ Office to settle any and all claims “filed, unfiled, or which could be filed,” arising from overpayments for pharmacy benefits or services between 2016 and 2021.
A closer look
The scrutiny of Hope Florida Foundation finances and the $10 million payment comes amid speculation that Casey DeSantis may run for governor but also as tensions continue to mount between DeSantis and top Republicans in the Florida House. 
AHCA Secretary Shevaun Harris disclosed the settlement agreement and the Centene payment during a lengthy House health care budget committee meeting Wednesday.
Following the contentious hearing, Harris put out a video with other DeSantis administration agency heads decrying the House hearing as an “ambush.”
During his Miami event, DeSantis lashed out at press reports over Hope Florida and asserted that House Republicans were orchestrating negative coverage of the program, which aims to “graduate” people from welfare assistance and other government aid to services offered by nonprofits and religious organizations. The foundation supports its work.
House Speaker Daniel Perez defended the hearing and contended that legislators were “seeking transparency” and “answers” about a secretive settlement agreement.
“No one is denying that there has been good work and that people have been helped,” Perez said Wednesday. “There are further questions we have to ask. … How was the money received? Where did it go? How was it used and why? … We should be able to hold them accountable.”

Jack McFarland said he's skeptical Louisiana will be able to keep $50 million in the state budget for an expanded voucher program next year. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature’s leadership said lawmakers are likely to eliminate funding for Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature education initiative: an expanded school voucher program called LA GATOR that would devote millions more in tax dollars to private education. 

Legislators are under pressure to find money to replace $2,000 and $1,000 stipends that public school teachers and support staff have received, respectively, for the past two years. 

To avoid a teacher pay cut next year, lawmakers will have to find an extra $198 million in the state budget. Diverting $50 million from the new LA GATOR program seems like an obvious choice, a few legislative leaders have said in interviews over the past two weeks. 

“A lot of members still want to do the teacher stipend,” said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, who oversees building of the state budget. “For me, it’s going to be challenging” to fund the LA GATOR program on top of the stipends. 

Yet cutting LA GATOR would scuttle one of Landry’s most significant legislative accomplishments since taking office last year. The Republican governor has been celebrating the new voucher program for months, even lighting the State Capitol and Superdome up with its trademark red color earlier this year. 

“That was the governor’s educational priority on the campaign trail,” Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley, who also pushed LA GATOR, said in an interview Wednesday. “Both literally and symbolically, that’s an important program to him.” 
How much of the teacher stipend can legislators restore? 

Eliminating school voucher expansion this year won’t guarantee educators get their full stipends. The $50 million LA GATOR money only covers about a quarter of what’s needed for the extra pay. 

Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said lawmakers can’t fully commit to funding the stipends yet, even as he supports removing the $50 million from school vouchers. 

“I think that just puts more pressure on us to be able to follow through on that whole amount” for stipends, Henry said.

The governor has been circumspect about whether he would support putting money for additional teacher pay in the budget, however. 

“We’ll continue to look inside the budget to see what we can find, and we will see where it ends up,” Landry told reporters during a news conference Wednesday. “I’m making no commitment on that.” 
The governor initially intended to launch LA GATOR while also making the stipends a permanent part of educators’ salaries this coming school year. But those plans were thwarted when state voters overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment in the March 29 election. 

The Landry-backed Amendment 2 was supposed to produce extra savings for the state and local school districts that would have covered, in part, this pay for teachers and school support staff. But it also included dozens of other tax and budget policy changes unrelated to teacher salaries that many voters found difficult to understand. In the end, it failed to pass with 65% of votes cast against the proposal. 

On Wednesday, Landry suggested the state’s 59,0000 public school teachers were, in part, to blame for the amendment failing, even though Louisiana’s two major teachers unions endorsed the measure. 

“We hoped to answer that in a very fiscally conservative way with what we put in Amendment 2 but apparently the teachers didn’t like that,” Landry said during the press conference. 
Still, Larry Carter, president of the Louisiana Federation of Teachers, is cautiously optimistic at least some of the stipends will be restored. He’s just not sure how much. 

“Nobody’s really locking any numbers down. I’m going to be honest,” Carter said Wednesday. 
LA GATOR applications
Cutting LA GATOR might be awkward for Landry and lawmakers because families have already applied for slots in the program. Brumley said Wednesday 33,000 applications have been submitted since the state started accepting them March 1, and the period to sign up goes through Tuesday, April 15. 
A little more than 5,000 of those applicants are low-income students who were enrolled in the existing school voucher program that started in 2012, according to information the education department provided Wednesday at a legislative hearing. 

Those students – many of whom have received vouchers to attend Catholic schools for years – will be guaranteed their private school tuition funding regardless of whether the $50 million for LA GATOR is removed. 
Henry and McFarland said they have no intention of cutting that allocation. Covering those 5,000 students would cost about $43 million on top of the $50 million meant for the LA GATOR expansion, Brumley said. 
Should it stay in the budget, the extra $50 million for LA GATOR would give 6,000 more students private education vouchers, for a total of 11,000 slots, Brumley said. 

LA GATOR awards are also designed to be more flexible than the state’s traditional voucher program. Accepted families could use the state dollars to cover private school tuition or other expenses for private school students, such as uniforms and tutoring. 
But with limited space, two out of every three students who have applied for the grants so far would be turned down, even if the $50 million for LA GATOR remained in the budget. 
The program is designed to eventually be open to students of all income levels, though with so few slots available for next school year, priority would be given to students with disabilities and children from low-income families, Brumley said
More than 80% of applicants – around 26,700 people – fall below the income threshold of 250% above the federal poverty line to receive preferential treatment, which is an $80,000 annual income for a family of four. A little over 2,400 are also students with disabilities, according to the state education department. 
Within the new low-income and students with disabilities applicant pool, people would be given the vouchers on a “first-come, first-serve” basis, Brumley said. Families who submitted applications at the beginning of the cycle would be more likely to receive a grant for their child. 

Daniel Erspamer, a LA GATOR advocate and head of the conservative Pelican Institute think tank, said legislators should be wary of cutting funding for a program that has proven to be popular. 
“Even at current funding that is in the governor’s executive budget, we would still have a significant wait list,” Erspamer said in an interview. “That is going to be something that the Legislature has to reckon with.” 

Rural students left out of LA GATOR 
There’s also skepticism from some of the legislative leadership that their own constituents would benefit from the LA GATOR program. 

While every legislator has public school teachers who live in their district, some don’t have private schools where their constituents could a LA GATOR grant.  

At Wednesday’s legislative hearing with Brumley, McFarland pointed out no one had applied to the LA GATOR program from Winn Parish, which is part of his House district. McFarland himself lives in Jackson Parish, which had just 12 applicants, according to education department data. 
McFarland and Henry have also questioned whether there were enough seats in existing private schools to absorb 6,000 more students. 

“I understand and appreciate you have a lot of applicants, and I understand why. But if the seats aren’t available, then why would I appropriate the other dollars for the program?” McFarland asked Brumley. 

Other lawmakers told Brumley they simply did not feel comfortable cutting teacher pay in a year when the state has made historic education gains. Last year, Louisiana students moved up dozens of spots in national rankings on reading comprehension tests, an unheard-of achievement in the state that Landry and lawmakers have repeatedly touted. 
“Our student achievement would not have taken place if it had not been for the hard work of our teachers,” said Rep. Barbara Freiberg, R-Baton Rouge, a former educator who supports retaining the full stipend.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_0529-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

(Courtesy of CMP)After an initial passage vote Tuesday in the Maine Senate, an emergency measure to better prepare the state for extreme weather events passed the Maine House of Representatives Thursday. 
Both chambers took their initial passage votes under the hammer for the symbolic first bill of the session, which is meant to represent a coming together of the parties.
Sponsored by party leadership in both chambers, LD 1 is a three-part proposal that seeks to improve emergency communications, create funding opportunities to make Maine homes more resilient and establish a new State Resilience Office to address flooding and other impacts.
The Legislature’s Housing and Economic Development Committee amended the bill to clarify certain language and flush out the Home Resiliency Program, which would provide grants to help homeowners better equip their houses to withstand severe weather events.
Since the bill contains an emergency preamble, it will require two-thirds support in the next round of votes, known as enactment votes. If that support is secured, the bill would take effect immediately upon passage, rather than waiting the usual 90 days after the session adjourns.
The legislation follows the interim recommendations from the Maine Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission, which Mills established by executive order last spring in response to the series of severe storms that caused an estimated $90 million in damage to public infrastructure across Maine last winter. 
It also builds upon $60 million for storm relief that was included in the state’s supplemental budget last year.

A bill that would require the state to apply a “balancing test” in considering proposed gas or oil drilling permits near certain waterbodies and shore areas won unanimous approval in a Senate committee on Thursday and now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
The measure (SB 1300), sponsored by North Florida Republican Corey Simon, differs from its House companion (HB 1143), which would ban oil and gas drilling within 10 miles of a National Estuarine Research Reserve (NEER). There are three NEER’s in Florida — the Apalachicola in North Florida, the Guana Tolomato Matanzas in Ponta Verde Beach, and Rookery Bay in Naples.
The House bill sponsors, North Florida Republican Jason Shoaf and Democrat Allison Tant, have said that their legislation is a response to a decision last year by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to permit an exploratory oil well along the Apalachicola River.
Wakulla County resident Hunter Levine, host of the Captain’s Collective podcast, which focuses on the fishing industry, spoke before the Senate Agriculture, Environment, and General Government Appropriations Committee on Thursday. He said that he’s interviewed nearly 200 fishing industry leaders across the globe and learned from their shared experiences.
“And whether they’re fishing guides or small business owners, oystermen, artists, photographers — they’ve all shared one common lesson, and that it’s the decisions that we make today determine the opportunities that we afford others tomorrow,” he said. “These amazing places are not an accident, they are a result. … A result of good policy and protection, something that this bill offers.”
“The possibility of potentially drilling is very concerning for my business and for the future of these farmers,” added Jeff Wren of Rattlesnake Cove Oysters. “I appreciate Sen. Simon looking out for our way of life.”
Both House and Senate versions of the legislation have cleared all of their committees and await a final vote in their respective chambers.

Dave McCormick says it’s too early to tell effectiveness of tariffs during telephone town hall,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/sen-dave-mccormick-says-its-too-early-to-tell-effectiveness-of-tariffs-during-telephone-town-hall/,First-term lawmaker also said a “showdown” was looming between the federal government and sanctuary cities.,"U.S. Sen Dave McCormick (R-PA) tours the Pennsylvania Farm Show on Jan. 11, 2025. (John Cole/Capital-Star)During his second telephone town hall since being sworn-in, Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R) said it was too early to determine how effective President Donald Trump’s tariff policies are, but urged patience as he backs the ever-changing approach.
“I think the honest answer is, it’s just too early to tell,” McCormick said.
A constituent asked McCormick if there was data that supports tariffs being effective to boost the American manufacturing sector versus increasing costs for consumers.
The senator said he believes tariffs “could really make sense” against China and other countries, who he believes have been “very unfair” to the United States, citing their trade policies.
On April 2, Trump announced tariffs on products from all foreign countries, although on Wednesday he announced a 90 day pause for countries willing to negotiate new trade deals. However, Trump’s announcement does not include China, saying he will increase to a 125% tariff on imports to the United States.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump said more than 75 countries reached out to him to negotiate and as a result he dropped their tariff rates to a universal 10%.
Several rounds of tariffs the president enacted in March will remain in place, including 25% import taxes on foreign steel, aluminum and cars — charges which sparked the European Union to approve retaliatory tariffs Wednesday.
Canada and Mexico, which both face up to 25% tariffs on a sizable chunk of products, will continue to see the levies but will not face an additional 10% stacked on top.
Trump’s 25% tax on imports from any country that buys oil from Venezuela also remains unchanged.
McCormick said he believes the best way to make tariffs work is to “be very specific about the bad behavior” from those countries and trading partners and negotiate deals that are “fair for the American worker.”
“That’s what I think is happening now,” McCormick said. “I think there’s a series of negotiations underway with the countries around the world that are having that conversation about, here’s what’s unfair. That’s why there’s a tariff on you, or there’s going to be a tariff on you, and here’s what you need to do. So that’s the goal of it.”
McCormick describes himself as a supporter of “reciprocal” tariffs.
McCormick, and other supporters of Trump’s plan, have argued that if it is successful, it will help increase manufacturing in the United States and make it easier to sell products abroad. However some economists are skeptical and worry about rising costs for consumers.

The state’s junior U.S. senator also acknowledged that it is “a little too early to tell” the impact it will have on consumers, if Trump’s tariff plan is successful.
“It depends a lot on the currency, but there could be an increase in prices,” McCormick said. “So for me, I’m trying to give the president some time to execute his strategy.” 
McCormick said he will be monitoring the situation carefully by following consumer prices and attempting to “be a force” on influencing trade negotiations with the White House.
“But as I said, we’re four or five days into this,” McCormick said Wednesday evening. “I think it’s just too early to know what the implications are.”
“I think we should give the President a little bit of time to get his strategy in place, because it’s already evolved a good bit just since it was announced,” he added.
Others on the call expressed concern with the latest turmoil in the stock market since Trump’s tariff announcement.
McCormick said it’s hard to watch the volatility right now with the stock market, but believes that it “is going to be just fine” if Trump’s “pro-growth policies” are put in place regarding tariffs, energy, investing in manufacturing, and extending tax cuts.
“I think the best way to deal with it is, monitor carefully, but don’t plan on making any changes based on what happened yesterday or what happens today,” McCormick said in response to a question from a 42 year-old constituent concerned about their 401K.
“Over the long term, if our economy is strong, if we put those pro-growth policies in place, the economy is going to take off,” he added. “And if the economy takes off, then the stock market is going to be just fine.”
McCormick said he’s “really sympathetic” to those who are past retirement watching the volatility in the stock market, and vowed that he would protect their benefits by not touching Social Security.

A “showdown” for sanctuary cities may be looming
McCormick predicted there will be a standoff between the federal government and Pennsylvania’s sanctuary cities and counties.
“Both from a law enforcement perspective, but also from federal funding,” McCormick said.
Since Trump was elected, some elected officials in Pennsylvania, including Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, have said their offices would not work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as the federal government proceeds with the president’s campaign promise of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
Saying the number one issue in the previous presidential election was issues relating to border policies, he pointed to Trump’s victory as a reason he believes people want to see the Department of Homeland Security crack down on sanctuary cities.
“I’m all for enforcing the law humanely. I’m all for repatriating people back to their countries, recognizing that’s a very difficult thing to do,” McCormick said. “But in the end, we have to enforce the law, and I think that’s what’s going to happen with these towns and cities that are not enforcing the law.”
“I think there’s going to be a showdown, which ultimately they’re going to lose,” he added.
There are 13 sanctuary cities and counties in Pennsylvania, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.
On Thursday, Trump announced on social media that his administration was “working on papers to withhold all Federal Funding for any City or State that allows” sanctuary cities.

Tips cap to Casey on bill to boost homecare workers for aging population
In response to a constituent’s call from Morgantown, Berks County, McCormick said he will consider supporting the Credit for Caring Act.
Sponsors of the bipartisan legislation say the proposal would create a new tax credit of up to $5,000 for working family caregivers.
A member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, he said the issue has been brought up to him by constituents before as well as groups that have lobbied on behalf of Alzheimer’s patients back the proposal.

In an effort to curb classroom disruptions and address rising concerns over student behavior and mental health, Delaware lawmakers are advancing new legislation that would require all public schools and charter schools in the state to adopt stricter policies on student cell phone use.
Sen. Eric Buckson, R-South Dover, introduced Senate Bill 106 on Tuesday, a bipartisan measure aimed at empowering schools to set enforceable limits on phone use during the school day. The bill responds to growing concern from educators and parents over the impact of constant digital distractions on learning environments.
Cell phones in schools
“As a former public school educator and a parent, I’ve seen firsthand how cell phones can undermine the learning environment,” Buckson said. “This bill strikes a balance by respecting local control while ensuring schools take real action to reduce classroom distractions and foster more focused, respectful learning spaces.”
If passed, SB 106 would require every school district and charter school in Delaware to implement a written cell phone policy by August 1.
READ: TODAY: Gov. Meyer to give State of the State address at 2:30 p.m.
These policies must include clear definitions of acceptable and unacceptable use, restrict phones during instructional time, and outline specific consequences for violations. Limited use would be allowed in designated areas or times, and exceptions would be made for emergencies or medical and educational needs.
The legislation also mandates that the policies be created with input from educators and ensures that responsibility for enforcement is shared across school staff, not left solely to individual teachers.
Recent studies support the need for action. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey found that 72% of public high school teachers consider cell phones a major source of distraction. Locally, a Delaware Department of Education survey revealed that 61% of teachers and staff viewed phone use as “very disruptive” in classrooms.
“Cell phones aren’t going away, and they can be useful tools when used appropriately,” Buckson said. “But too often, they’re a barrier to learning, and we owe it to our students and teachers to set boundaries that support a healthy, focused classroom environment.”
SB 106 has been assigned to the Senate Education Committee, where it is expected to receive a hearing in the coming weeks.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-10-at-2.21.06-PM.png,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

Susan Humphries, a Wichita Republican, urged her House colleagues on April 10, 2025, to override Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's veto of a bill offering pregnant mothers child support from the date of conception. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House lawmakers overrode Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s vetoes of two anti-abortion bills Thursday, sending the measures on to the Senate.
Kelly vetoed both bills Wednesday. The required two-thirds of the House members, who were all Republicans, voted to overturn them.
Wichita Republican Rep. Susan Humphries called on legislators to override House Bill 2062, which creates what critics call “fetal personhood” language within a bill that cements child support payments for mothers based on pregnancy costs before a baby is born. It would also add a personal income tax exemption for any unborn child.
“This bill is about being compassionate to pregnant women,” Humphries said.
Kansas Family Voice and the Kansas Catholic Conference were major proponents and architects of the bill. Nicholas Heald, an anti-abortion protester who regularly demonstrates outside of the House and Senate chambers, said following the House vote that Kansas law and human biology affirm that fetuses are people.
“We don’t throw fetus showers,” said Heald, a 39-year-old who traveled from Wichita to Topeka to demonstrate at the Statehouse nearly every Wednesday.
In a roughly 25-minute speech, Rep. Nikki McDonald, an Olathe Democrat, addressed how expensive pregnancies can be and proposed what she thought were more effective strategies to aid pregnant women, including a raised minimum wage and increased access to affordable health insurance. She said the state needed to avoid unnecessary litigation and regulation.
“If we were serious about ensuring the well-being of a pregnant person, we would be passing bills that expand health care access, make health care affordable, broaden our sex education programs to include more than just an abstinence-only sex ed approach,” she said.
Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, an Overland Park Democrat, challenged the bill’s constitutionality, arguing it violated the Kansas Constitution’s “two-subject rule,” which prohibits bills from legislating more than one topic. The two topics at hand were child support and tax breaks, she said.
Minutes after overriding HB 2062, House Republicans overrode Senate Substitute for House Bill 2382.
It mandates school districts show a video of a developing fetus to students at any grade level during any course that deals with human growth, development and sexuality. The video shown to students must be at least three minutes long, show the development of vital organs and be “a high-quality, computer-generated animation or high-definition ultrasound,” according to the bill.
The bill also allows Kansas State Board of Education members to set their own salaries. An earlier version of the bill set state board member compensation rates at $286.81 per meeting day, which was based on legislative salaries, but the passed bill didn’t designate any funds for raises.
Opponents criticized the measure for its lack of standards and for overriding local control.
Rep. Linda Featherston, an Overland Park Democrat, said she didn’t believe the bill was appropriate and the Legislature was “overstepping.”
“Actually, what really bothers me about this bill is that it interferes with parental rights,” Featherston said.
Parents ought to have the ability to determine when they want to talk to their children about sex, she said.
Republican leadership characterized fetal education as a “commonsense” measure, said House Speaker Dan Hawkins of Wichita and Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover in a joint statement.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100252-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

<p>The federal government has revoked the visas of some international students studying at universities across Illinois, but college administrators are sharing few details, including how many students have been impacted.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign this week confirmed that some of its students are affected, but did not disclose a number. U of I ranks sixth nationally in the size of its international student body at over 15,000.</p>
<p>“Out of student privacy concerns, we are not sharing specific information, but we are working directly with affected students to help them connect with appropriate resources and understand their options,” said Robin Kaler, a university spokesperson. Kaler declined to provide more details, though multiple sources familiar with the situation at U of I, who asked that their names not be used because they are not authorized to speak on the matter, say the number of students whose visas have been revoked is at least several dozen — and likely growing.</p>
<p>The revocations are part of a broader federal crackdown playing out on campuses across the country. International students have faced abrupt visa cancellations in recent weeks, as the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration dragnet ensnares college students, federal officials claim have violated visa rules, though the reasons for the revocations are not always made clear. In many cases, students have also lost their status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, which allows them to legally stay in the U.S. while enrolled in school.</p>
<p>Across its vast network of public and private colleges and universities, Illinois hosts one of the largest international student populations in the nation, ranking fifth, with more than 55,000 international students, according to a <a href=""https://opendoorsdata.org/data/international-students/leading-institutions/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2024 Open Doors report</a>.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker’s office said it has been in “close touch” with both public and private university leaders across the state but declined to share any information about how many students have been affected — or whether it even knows. The spokesperson said Pritzker’s office is deferring to the universities to provide data on what is “an incredibly fluid situation.”</p>
<p>Ed Yohnka, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said the lack of transparency from both federal officials and universities raises serious concerns about accountability and democratic oversight. It also makes it difficult for advocacy groups like his to provide a meaningful response to affected students.</p>
<p>“One of the things we often think about when we think about the First Amendment, or we think about free speech is that I can't speak freely about what the government's doing if I don't know they're doing it. I can't actually exercise my constitutional right to participate, criticize and critique the government if, in fact, the government acts in such an opaque way that I can't know what the heck they're doing,” he said.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“And, so I think that's why, if the federal government won't share this information — if they're trying to, sort of, just sneak one by here — this is where it gets incredibly important for universities to at least give some sort of number, some sort of range, to say that people in their community are being impacted and affected by these reckless and unlawful government policies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Many schools are citing privacy laws, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as to why they cannot disclose information about student visas.</p>
<p>SIU professor William Freivogel said that while the FERPA bars university disclosure of a student's visa status unless the student gives written permission, the university should release anonymized data — without student names or identifying information.</p>
<p>“If the university is concerned that a student is losing the[ir] visa without the government presenting adequate reasons, the university can ask the student if it can disclose the information,” said Freivogel, who specializes in media law. “Presumably the governor's office, if concerned about the situation statewide, could try to collect information in the same way — asking students if they want to waive their FERPA rights so that people can get a better picture of what is happening statewide and nationwide.”</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=""https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-remarks-to-the-press-3/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">said in late March</a> that student visas are being revoked because select international students came to the U.S. to study, but instead engaged in “activist movements that are disruptive and undermine universities,” through protests on campus, specifically those that “are supportive of movements that run counter to the foreign policy of the United States.” That includes those calling for support of the Palestinian people and a ceasefire in Gaza, although it is unclear what the U.S. considers to be “movements that run counter to the foreign policy of the United States.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 9, the U.S. said it will begin monitoring immigrants’ <a href=""https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">social media pages for antisemitism</a>.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for antisemitic violence and terrorism — think again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this new directive, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will consider social media content that indicates an immigrant “endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests” — which may lead to visa revocation and the inability to be reinstated.</p>

<p>As university leaders try to balance student concerns, fears of retaliation in an increasingly fraught political climate and growing demands for transparency, some say they feel left in the dark.

As the region sees a steady decline in respiratory illness cases following the most severe flu season since 2009, ChristianaCare will officially end its temporary Cough & Cold Line on April 11.
The service, which was introduced in February 2025 to help manage a surge in patients seeking care for flu-like symptoms, played a key role in offering timely support to the community. Designed to assist individuals experiencing coughs, colds, and other respiratory concerns, the Cough & Cold Line provided guidance and helped connect patients to appropriate care options.

Throughout its seven-week run, the line handled more than 1,200 calls — a clear sign of the community’s urgent need for accessible healthcare resources during a particularly difficult flu season.
“This flu season was the worst in over a decade and we want to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who used the Cough & Cold Line to help find the most appropriate care for their respiratory symptoms,” said Sarah Schenck, M.D., FACP, executive director of the ChristianaCare Center for Virtual Health.
Due to its effectiveness, ChristianaCare plans to implement similar services in the future to continue meeting community needs. Many callers were able to manage their symptoms at home or access virtual primary or urgent care, reducing unnecessary visits to crowded emergency departments.
“This service line played a vital role in supporting our patients and our caregivers when it was most crucial and we are proud of the impact made.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lifestyle-adult-with-health-problems-1-scaled-e1744308599378-1024x382.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.A budget bill passed by the state House housing committee Wednesday would prioritize funding for communities whose rules allow for multifamily housing construction, and don’t require certain size, parking or aesthetic requirements for new developments. 
The bill (HF2445, as amended) instructs the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to “prioritize applications for projects located in jurisdictions that have policies conducive to developing residential properties” in its competitive grant and loan programs. 
The agency would prioritize cities and counties that: 

Allow multifamily housing in at least 75% of the area zoned for commercial use. 
Allow duplexes, townhomes or detached apartments in at least 75% of the area zoned for single-family housing, and allowing developers to get permits for those buildings using the same process and standards as single-family homes. 
Do not require more than one parking stall per unit of housing.
Do not require lots to be bigger than one-eighth of an acre. 
Do not require certain aesthetics, materials or garage sizes.

“This is providing a carrot — not a mandate, but a carrot — to cities to update their own policies in a way that will make it easier to build more homes,” said Rep. Michael Howard, DFL-Richfield, who is co-chair of the House Housing Finance and Policy Committee.
The policies prioritized in the budget bill are similar to those backed by housing leaders in both parties, plus religious groups, labor unions and housing developers. Those policy bills passed in both housing committees, but have not yet received hearings in the state and local government committees, where similar legislation died last year after intense opposition from city leaders. 
Big-picture budget negotiations between the DFL-led Senate and tied House are still ongoing, but both chambers indicated they would like to give the state housing agency a small funding boost, while looking for large cuts elsewhere. 
The budget bill passed by the housing committee would allocate:

$500,000 in one-time funding for a statewide hotline to educate and advise renters. 
$150,000 to establish a new task force on accessible housing.
$20 million in one-time funding — more than double the funding in the current budget — for grants to greater Minnesota cities for the cost of extending sewer, water, streets and other infrastructure.
A $30 million one-time boost for the Family Homeless Prevention and Assistance Program, in addition to the program’s $10.7 million in ongoing funding. 
Ongoing funding for existing programs that finance the development of workforce housing, affordable rental housing, manufactured home infrastructure and housing rehabilitation; and programs that provide rental assistance, homeowner education and support to homebuyers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1218525-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

Free.,Fired federal probationary employees thrown back in limbo after court losses,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fired-federal-probationary-employees-thrown-back-limbo-after-court-losses,,"WASHINGTON — Fired federal probationary workers saw setbacks this week, as the U.S. Supreme Court and an appeals court dealt blows in two separate cases, leaving the newly hired or recently promoted employees hit by the administration’s mass firings once again in limbo.In a case that affected up to 24,000 fired probationary employees across 17 federal agencies, the U.S. Appeals Court for the 4th Circuit on Wednesday blocked a lower court order requiring the government to rehire the workers.A three-judge panel ruled 2-1 to stay the order, writing that the Trump administration is “likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.”Judge Allison Rushing, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2019, directed the order, with Judge James Wilkinson, a President Ronald Reagan appointee, concurring. Judge DeAndrea Benjamin, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2023, dissented.The case centered on a lawsuit filed by the Democratic attorneys general for 19 states and the District of Columbia, who allege economic harm because the federal government did not provide legally required warning ahead of an influx of unemployed state residents.Federal Judge James Bredar for the District of Maryland issued a preliminary injunction on April 2 requiring the government to rehire thousands of workers who either lived or reported to work only in the 19 plaintiff states and the District of Columbia while the case moved forward. They included:Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.The affected agencies included:The departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense (civilian employees only), Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, General Services Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Small Business Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development.The case marked the first time the government provided the number of probationary employees fired at each agency.Bredar required the figures from the government to show compliance with his mid-March emergency order that the agencies reinstate the workers. The documents showed that the majority of the employees were not recalled to active duty, but placed on administrative leave.Supreme Court actionIn the second case bearing on fired federal workers, the Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a lower court order mandating the federal government reinstate the jobs of 16,000 fired probationary federal workers across six agencies.The unsigned two-page order stated the nine nonprofits that brought the case do not have legal standing. The justices did not address the question at the center of the lawsuit: whether the firings were illegal.The Trump administration had escalated the case to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket after the U.S. Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit denied the government’s request to block the agencies from rehiring the employees.U.S. District Judge William Alsup for the Northern District of California extended his temporary emergency order on March 13, mandating the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affairs reinstate employees who were fired under a directive from the Office of Personnel Management as part of an agenda by President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce.As the case continues on the lower court track, lawyers for the American Federal of Government Employees, AFL-CIO faced the Trump administration in court Wednesday before Alsup, a Clinton appointee. Alsup ordered both to provide more information by the end of the day Friday, including a comprehensive list of those fired and statements about economic harms.",,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

“It underlines how the uncertainty and the unpredictability behind the tariffs may be even more damaging than the actual tariffs,” Jordan Rosenberg Cobos, a law student and president of the International Law Society, which co-hosted the lunchtime talk at the UNM School of Law, said. “It’s like you’re taking a load-bearing wall out of the global economy without much notice,”
The event included UNM professors in political science, economics and trade law, as well as the U.S. Mexican Consul based in Albuquerque, Patricia Pinzón. All agreed that the fluctuating tariffs impact not just consumer prices for New Mexicans, the U.S. and the rest of the world, but also challenge the basis of free trade between countries.
“I’m an optimist, but it’s hard to see a positive outcome,” Law professor Paul Figueroa, whose decades of trade law experience included extensive travel, said. “If the tariffs stand, then the world trade order will forever change,” and it will become less open, more “unsettled and uncertain.”
Tariffs may increase tax revenues, Xiaoyang Wang, an assistant professor in economics, noted, but even the proposed 10% tax on imports drives up prices for both customers and suppliers, and squeezes supply of goods.
Pinzón said Mexico would rather negotiate with the Trump administration for better trade positions, rather than institute retaliatory tariffs.
“We know that when the U.S. does a unilateral decision, our best answer is to negotiate,” she said.
Pinzón also mentioned concerns about enforcement of tariffs at the border, noting that a Mexican auto industry analysis found that one auto part can cross the U.S.-Mexico border eight times before being fully installed.
“So each time a product crosses the border, are we talking about tariffs of 10% or 25%, how is that going to be implemented?” Pinzón said. “We don’t know, experts do not know at the technical level.”
Manuel Montoya, a professor in global economics, said free trade has enabled the growth of wealth for more people in emerging economies across the world.
“The implications of this are not just whether or not your goods and services are going to be expensive,” Montoya said. “It’s going to be about the very nature of political and economic cooperation moving forward for the next 50 to 70 years.”
Takeaways for New Mexicans
The academic panelists said tariff impacts will hit everyone’s wallet, and New Mexicans will have to brace to pay more for clothes, food and electronics.
“I think it’s inevitable that the prices of products that people buy in places like Walmart are going to go up, and that is certainly going to affect people,” said Wendy Hansen, a professor in political science.
Hansen also warned that agricultural products may see additional tariffs responding to the Trump administration’s tariffs, a repeat of what happened in 2018, during the first term.
“I don’t know which products in New Mexico might be affected by it, but China’s best card in their pocket is agriculture, the EU maybe as well,” Hansen said.
Speaking with Source NM after the presentation, Pinzón emphasized that “Mexico is New Mexico’s first trading partner; that gives us a special relationship.”
Pinzón said ongoing discussions center around further development at the Santa Teresa port of entry, calling it “one of the key industrial ports for both Mexico and the U.S.”
Also following the discussion, Montoya told Source his hope is that New Mexico’s adaptation and cultural traditions throughout its history will offer paths forward, despite the economic uncertainty.
“This is a state where we have the birthplace of the atomic bomb, but also some of the longest-standing and resilient agricultural-based systems in the United States,” Montoya said. “That combination tells you a lot about the mixture and the middle ground that New Mexico has.”

He is the first person to be convicted of criminal wage theft in Minnesota. (Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) A Hennepin County District Court judge handed down Minnesota’s first wage theft conviction on Wednesday against a painting contractor, Frederick Leon Newell, for stealing more than $35,000 in wages from five workers at an affordable housing development in north Minneapolis.
Prosecutors and union leaders heralded the conviction as a major step forward in the state’s yearslong effort to crack down on wage theft, which is more common than robbery, according to some estimates despite being rarely prosecuted.
“This prosecution and conviction should send a message to all workers: Your wage complaints will be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated and prosecuted,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said at a news conference on Thursday.
In 2019, Minnesota legislators passed one of the most stringent wage theft laws in the country, making it a felony to steal more than $1,000, like other forms of theft. Yet few have been charged in the past six years, in large part because of a lack of knowhow and resources by local law enforcement to investigate white collar crimes.
Newell will likely be put on probation for three to five years but could face a year in the county workhouse for the felony convictions of wage theft and theft by swindle when he’s sentenced in June, Moriarty said.
An attorney for Newell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The convictions stem from painting and cleaning work Integrated Painting Solutions was hired to do in 2020 on the Redwell, an affordable apartment complex in north Minneapolis.

Newell’s company received more than $320,000 for the work on the development, which required that he pay a prevailing minimum wage of $36 per hour for painters and $36.41 per hour for general laborers plus benefits because it received public funding through tax increment financing.
Newell paid his workers far less than required — from $15 to $25 per hour — and submitted falsified payroll records to cover up the underpayments. All told, Newell stole more than $43,000 in wages from five workers, with one employee underpaid by nearly $14,000 over just three months in 2020, according to the criminal conviction.
The case came to light after the workers filed complaints with the city of Minneapolis’s Civil Rights Division, with the help of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades union.
The city investigated their claims and in June 2021 issued a violation letter to Integrated Painting Solutions that employees were owed restitution for unpaid wages. Newell signed a settlement agreement with the city to pay $43,166 in restitution but never did.
Greiner Construction, the general contractor for the Redwell, voluntarily made Newell’s workers whole beyond what they had already paid to Newell’s company.
In 2022, the previous Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, filed charges against Newell after receiving a referral from the city of Minneapolis.
Hennepin County District Court Judge Michael Burns presided over a bench trial in the case in January. Prosecutors called 12 witnesses and submitted 60 exhibits while Newell didn’t call any witnesses or submit any evidence. His attorney argued that prosecutors hadn’t met the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Burns determined there was sufficient evidence to convict Newell of the two felonies and also ruled that there are factors justifying a longer sentence than the stayed 21 month prison term recommended under the state’s sentencing guidelines.
Newell may still operate a painting contracting business though he is effectively barred from publicly funded projects in Minneapolis and may face similar restrictions at the state level, according to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office.
On Thursday, Jordan Fry, a business agent with the painters union, encouraged workers to report labor law violations so that low-road contractors are held accountable.
“You must come forward to tell your story,” Fry said. “We are here… we will stand with you.”
While prosecutors and labor leaders celebrated the convictions, they also acknowledged that the slow pace of justice is a significant impediment to deterrence.
The convictions come five years after the crime occurred, illustrating the low priority wage theft cases have in finding time on court schedules packed with murders, assaults, burglaries and rapes.
“We are trying to figure out how to make these cases go a little faster,” Moriarty said, which includes encouraging the court to set aside a judge to handle wage theft cases.
“It’s hard to hold people accountable when they know they’re not actually going to see a judge,” she said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida PhoenixGov. Ron DeSantis expressed support during a Thursday press conference for Senate President Ben Albritton’s plan to permanently exempt sales taxes on all clothing worth $75 or less.
Both legislative leaders and DeSantis have pushed for tax cuts in different forms, with neither the Albritton nor House Speaker Daniel Perez taking up the governor’s idea of a $1,000 rebate for homeowners with homestead exemptions.
However, DeSantis said he agreed with a narrower sales tax cut over Perez’s plan to permanently cut sales taxes by .75%, which is estimated to lower tax collections by $5 billion.
“If you’re going to do sales tax, I think I agree with the president of the Senate, Albritton,” DeSantis said in the City of Sweetwater Community Center, where he also knocked the House’s condo bill. “If you’re going to do sales tax, target it to things that are going to benefit Floridians.”
The governor has been slamming Perez’s sales tax plan, announced on March 26, for weeks, saying it would help tourists more than the average Floridian.
However, with only a few weeks left in the legislative session and with lawmakers entering budget negotiations, Albritton announced Wednesday his own plan, which the chamber is expected to vote on next week. It comes at a lower price tag than the lower chamber’s, reducing tax collections by $750 million.
“These are necessities too, now, right? … We’re not talking about you know, folks that are tourists that may come in and go buy, you know, a $300 dollar jacket or things like that,” Albritton said Wednesday. “We have aligned this, we believe, at the $75 to where it can help the most number of Floridians.”
Perez didn’t comment directly on the Senate plan on Wednesday, but expressed optimism that the chambers would figure out the $4.4 billion gap between their budgets as speculation grows over whether lawmakers can settle their budget differences in time to adjourn on time on May 2.

According to the agreement, states and local education agencies until then cannot be investigated or asked to provide certification that they are not using DEI, a term for race- and gender-conscious practices, in admissions, programming, training, hiring or scholarships.Education Department spokeswoman Madi Biedermann said the department and the groups reached the agreement Monday.An April 3 letter from the department demanded states and districts provide certifications they were complying with the order within 10 days or risk losing federal funding. That letter followed a February missive introducing the order.The National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union sued in New Hampshire federal court last month to block enforcement of the directive.“This pause in enforcement provides immediate relief to schools across the country while the broader legal challenge continues,” the NEA said in a Thursday statement.In a written statement, Biedermann said the extension was due to what the department saw as states’ efforts to comply with the order.“The Department extended the certification requirement on Monday in response to states’ good-faith inquiries to ensure compliance,” Biedermann wrote. “Having voluntarily extended the deadline, commonsense would dictate the Department would not take enforcement action until the deadline had passed.”Court battleThe groups asked the court to issue an emergency ruling to block enforcement of the department’s order while the case is ongoing.The agreement effectively grants that request without a court order.“No school district, state agency, or higher education institution will face investigation or penalties for failure to return the challenged certification that diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts do not exist within their curriculums,” the NEA said.The underlying lawsuit remains ongoing.The suit challenges the department’s authority to impose restrictions on state K-12 curriculum and says the order limits academic freedom and restricts educators’ ability to teach.Trump and DEIPresident Donald Trump campaigned against progressive cultural positions, including how race, gender and sexuality are handled in public schools.In the early months of his second presidency, the entire executive branch has moved to restrict DEI initiatives and education policy, which has long been a battleground for such issues, has been a focal point.The administration has used antidiscrimination requirements to pursue restrictions on DEI initiatives in education, arguing that DEI discriminates against white students.DEI programs “discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity characteristics in clear violation of Title VI,” Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting head of civil rights, said in an April 3 statement.",,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

According to a press release, NCHT is a collaborative effort of community leaders, environmental organizations, advocates for seniors, housing professionals, business groups and “everyday North Carolinians on the left, right and center united around one goal: advancing housing solutions that work for everyone.”
NCHT was founded by Denzel Burnside, who serves as the group’s executive director. Burnside was recently executive director of WakeUP Wake County, where he was responsible for leading community discussions and policy action on the issues of affordable housing, transit access, climate action and land use planning.
“In North Carolina, I believe everything starts with home,” Burnside said in a news release. “Freedom and opportunity depend on where people can live, how they access jobs, and whether they can build a stable future.”
A present, however, Burnside says that objective is out of reach for a large proportion of North Carolinians. He pointed to a recent report commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation, NC Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS — “2024 Housing Supply Gap Analysis, State of North Carolina” — which found an expected gap of 764,000 total units (322,000 rental units and 442,000 units for purchase) between 2024-2029.
“Through smart, equitable, proven policies to create more homes of all shapes and sizes, we can open real pathways to homeownership and upward mobility,” Burnside said. “Our goal is to work diligently at the statewide level to build communities that are accessible, connected, and centered on the needs of North Carolinians.”
The NCHT will host a virtual launch event, “Setting the Table: Why Housing Choice Matters in NC,” at 2:00 pm on April 15 as a live Zoom gathering that will also be streamed on YouTube. The event will include community voices across North Carolina to discuss housing challenges, solutions, and policy focus for 2025.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)The death toll from the floods that hit Kentucky over the last week has risen to six, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. 
Those who have died are, according to Beshear: a 66-year-old Campbell County man, a boy in Franklin County, a 74-year-old woman in Nelson County, a 65-year-old man in Trigg County, a 27-year-old man in McCracken County and a 50-year-old man in Bullitt County. 
The state’s Team Kentucky Storm Relief Fund will cover the funeral expenses for those lost. 
Additionally, at least 70 of Kentucky’s 120 counties have declared states of emergency following the deadly storms. 
“That means in each of these counties, they believe that there is enough damage, that there was enough flash flooding, storm damage, or river bank flooding to necessitate a state of emergency,” Beshear said during his weekly press conference. 
Beshear is asking President Donald Trump’s administration for individual assistance and expects to submit that application Friday, he said. 
“We want to make our best case to get that first round in, and then we will add counties after that,” Beshear said. “We’ve been through enough of these, we know that that is the fastest, most effective and most efficient process to do it.” 
Meanwhile, the Ohio River at Louisville crested Wednesday at nearly 68 feet, but won’t crest further west for a few days yet. It’s expected to crest at Owensboro on Saturday or Sunday, in Henderson on Sunday, and then in Paducah sometime next week, Beshear said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Julian Beaudion, a small-business owner and former state trooper from Sioux Falls, announced Thursday that he is seeking South Dakota’s Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Mike Rounds. 
“This campaign isn’t about me — it’s about securing a future where South Dakota’s working families don’t get left behind,” Beaudion said in a statement.
He and his wife co-own Swamp Daddy’s Cajun Kitchen, and he also operates The Hub, a professional development program. He previously served 13 years as a South Dakota Highway Patrol trooper and is a graduate of the Obama Foundation’s Leaders program. If elected, Beaudion would be the first Black person from South Dakota to serve in Congress.
He said his campaign will focus on “practical solutions, bipartisan cooperation, and creating economic opportunities for all South Dakotans.” His priorities include investing in rural infrastructure, expanding telehealth services and supporting workforce development. 
“I’ll fight to enforce the checks and balances our Constitution demands and reject the influence of big money and tech monopolies threatening our freedoms,” he said.

Beaudion criticized what he described as Rounds’ defense of and support for President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s policy agenda, including firing federal workers without congressional approval and Rounds’ legislation to eliminate the federal Department of Education.
A Rounds spokesman sent a statement in response to a South Dakota Searchlight message: “Mike is focused on the actual job — securing the border, national defense, growing our economy, eliminating the federal Department of Education, and working with President Trump to get our country back on track. South Dakotans have soundly rejected Bidenomics and Obama’s job-killing policies. Good luck running on that platform.” 
The South Dakota Democratic Party announced on Monday that it will conduct public town halls this month in at least four South Dakota cities. Beaudion will be one of the Democrats participating in those events.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Stories of businesses being hurt by local or state government construction projects have become common in Florida in recent years.
Last year, the owners of a popular Tampa cafe went before the Tampa City Council to voice concern about how a long-term construction project in front of their business was “hemorrhaging” its cash reserves, threatening their financial livelihood. 
That cafe ended up closing several months later. 
But that company might have been able to stay afloat if a proposal that advanced in a Florida Senate committee on Thursday had already been in place. 
The measure from Orange County Democrat Carlos Guillermo Smith (SB 324) would create a program within the Department of Commerce providing low-interest loans of up to $100,000 for small businesses harmed by prolonged state and local construction projects that directly block access to their establishments.
The businesses must show proof of demonstrable loss, including a reduction in revenue from the start date of the construction to the week before they submit an application. 
That proof would have to include a comparison of the applicant’s average weekly or monthly revenue the year before the construction began and their currently weekly or monthly revenue. They would also have to submit photo or video evidence of the obstruction to the business due to the construction zone.
Smith said the impetus for filing the bill was the closing in January of the Hammered Lamb, a locally owned restaurant in Orlando.
“They directly attributed that closure to this sewage infrastructure project that was delayed for 18 months,” he said. “As Florida continues to experience tremendous growth, we’re going to hear more about these stories, more and more. We can’t as a state or a local government throw up our hands and say, ‘I’m sorry. Deal with our construction.’ We have to be able to offer a lifeline for those who want to stay afloat.”
Those problems continue.
An estimated $65 million project to improve South Tampa’s stormwater system bitterly divided that community last fall, with businesses fearful the plan could shut down a section of a major street in both directions for up to two months, potentially devastating their bottomlines.
Public disclosure?
In the Senate Appropriations Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development on Thursday, Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia suggested Smith amend his bill to exclude the private business records from public disclosure.
“It seems to me that competitors would say, “I want the P&Ls [profits and losses] of my competitor right across the street,'” Ingoglia said.
The bill passed unanimously, athough Ingoglia expressed concern about giving taxpayer subsidized loans to businesses that might not be able to qualify for such a loan anywhere else. “To get an unsecured loan for an established business is relatively easy to come by,” he said. “Granted, you’re gong to pay higher interest rates, but that loan is pretty east to come by.”
The bill has one more stop before reaching the floor. However, its House companion (HB 215), sponsored by Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani, has not received a hearing yet in any committee.

(Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA— Following wildfires that scorched more than 18,000 acres in South Carolina, legislators are considering increasing penalties for the people who carelessly put lives and property at risk.
The lead sponsor of a bill discussed Wednesday said he hopes the threat of higher fines and jail time cause people to think before negligently starting a blaze.
“We’re doing all we can to prevent these types of fires,” Rep. Tim McGinnis, R-Myrtle Beach, told a House subcommittee considering the bill. It was the first hearing on a bill he introduced March 27 with 26 co-sponsors.
“Much like you think twice before you have a few drinks and get behind an automobile, I want you to think twice before you burn,” he said.
No injuries or damage to structures as SC wildfires expand past 10,000 acres

It’s a danger that hits close to home for him: McGinnis noted he could smell the smoke from the Carolina Forest fire that spread to more than 2,000 acres the first weekend of March.
It’s still not completely out. As of Tuesday, that fire was 90% contained, according to the state Forestry Commission. The agency declared wildfires in Pickens and Greenville counties 100% contained, thanks to significant rainfall Monday in the Upstate.
They were the largest of 395 wildfires statewide last month that burned a total of 23,525 acres, according to the commission.
There have been no reports of injuries or significant property loss from any of them.
But they still endangered the lives of residents and the firefighters working to put them out. Plus, the fires prompted evacuations, required the help of paid and volunteer firefighters statewide, and cost millions to control, legislators said.
Yet, the people who carelessly start such disasters are hardly punished. The penalty needs to be more of a deterrent, McGinnis said.
Under the changes discussed Wednesday, the maximum penalty for people who carelessly or negligently set a fire that spreads would increase from 30 days to one year in jail on first offense. They could also be fined up to $5,000, up from just $200.
If they do it again, their penalties would increase to up to three years of imprisonment and a $25,000 fine.
Rep. Jeff Johnson, the subcommittee chairman, said he’s “a big proponent of doing something that makes” those responsible for causing wildfires more accountable.
Johnson, a Conway Republican, called it a “great bill.” But he wanted more time to look over the proposed amendment before his subcommittee took a vote.
According to the Forestry Commission, at least two of last month’s largest wildfires were started by human carelessness.
For the Carolina Forest fire, a 40-year-old Myrtle Beach woman was arrested March 6 and accused of “not taking the proper precautions” to prevent flames from spreading from her fire pit. Her attorney is seeking a dismissal, saying she’s being scapegoated.
The Table Rock blaze in Pickens County started March 21 from four teenagers, including a juvenile under 18 years old, who failed to properly put out cigarettes. All four face a negligence charge, according to the commission.
That fire grew to 13,845 acres — jumping the North Carolina border — making it the largest recorded mountain fire in state history. About 1,400 homes were evacuated as a result of it.
An investigation continues into the Persimmon Ridge fire in Greenville County, which burned more than 2,100 acres, Justin Holt, a Forestry Commission spokesman, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Combatting last month’s three largest wildfires cost the Forestry Commission alone more than $10 million, not including aid from dozens of other state and local agencies, he said.
Scott Phillips, the commission’s head forester, supported the bill, saying the agency “generally supports increases in penalties for wildfire related criminal charges.”
House Majority Leader Davey Hiott also supported increasing the penalties.
The Pickens Republican said he could see flames from the Table Rock fire from his front porch.
“You read about these things. You see these things on TV. You never think they are going to hit home as close as this one did,” Hiott said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Table-Rock-Z8-10-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 13:15:36.781389

(Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)The Missouri House Budget Committee approved more than $4 billion in construction funding Thursday, including 45 new earmarked items for projects that include a county government maintenance shed and a capital city parking garage.
About half of the spending is reauthorization of projects approved in past years and funded mainly from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. As of March 31, the state had $1.3 billion remaining to be spent from the $2.9 billion originally received from the federal COVID-19 relief law.
Overall, the new items increased general revenue spending for construction projects by $76 million more in general revenue than requested by Gov. Mike Kehoe. Adding the three construction bills to the operating budget approved in the House last week brings total spending proposed in the lower chamber to $52 billion, about $1.7 billion less than Kehoe proposed in January.
The construction budget will be debated in the full House on Tuesday.
Deaton said he was comfortable with adding general revenue items despite a tax cut bill awaiting a final vote and ongoing uncertainty about federal budget cuts.
Current general revenue receipts are declining and a general revenue surplus built up to $5.7 billion two years ago is expected to be $2.5 billion at the end of June.
This may be the last year that lawmakers are able to tap the surplus for earmarked projects, committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, said to reporters after the meeting.
“We’re still in a good position, but certainly those opportunities are diminishing,” he said. “And if it’s not next year, it’ll be the year after that.”
Deaton’s willingness to add dozens of small items for members is in contrast to his predecessor, former state Rep. Cody Smith. In past years, most earmarks were inserted during Senate consideration of the budget.
The change drew praise from the committee’s ranking Democrat, state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield.
“This has been the most collaborative and productive budget year that I’ve been a part of,” Fogle said.
The smallest item added to the construction list is $60,000 for a maintenance and equipment shed for Dallas County government. The largest is $20 million for a new Jefferson City parking garage that is part of a $130 million hotel and conference center.
To find money for the parking garage Deaton cut funding requested by Kehoe for renovations of the remaining structures of the Missouri State Penitentiary to support its use as a tourist attraction.
The original request of $52 million was pared down to $15 million, Deaton said, because members of the committee are willing to spend money to preserve the buildings but balk at major renovations or improvements on the property.
“If we were just to say, let’s just tear all these buildings down, it would be more than $15 million, so just to try to help them keep what they have and stabilize that seemed appropriate to me,” Deaton said to reporters after the meeting.
The parking garage would replace a crumbling structure near the Governor’s mansion and help relieve some of the problems finding parking in downtown Jefferson City, Deaton said. And adding it in the House makes friends in the Senate, he added.
“We’ve had talks with our colleagues on the other side of the building, and there’s some members over there I know that are very passionate about it,” Deaton said.
Of the other earmarked items added Thursday, there are 15 health-related projects that include hospital and mental health facilities and seven infrastructure projects for roads, bridges and water. There’s grants for library renovations in Newton and Barry counties and tourism projects to fund construction at the General Omar Bradley Memorial in Moberly, the Starlight Theatre in Kansas City and the Pony Express Museum in St. Joseph.
Deaton didn’t greenlight every request, said Republican state Rep. Wendy Hausman of St. Peters. 
“We had to prove that it’s beneficial throughout the state,” Hausman said.
The items that are funded are only a fraction of what he was asked to include, Deaton said.
“No matter what the resources we bring to bear, there’s always more need than there is opportunities to meet those needs,” he said.
Democrats were treated fairly and saw some of their items funded, Fogle said.
“The chair has continued to show a willingness to work with minority members and get some of our investments in the budget,” she said. “And today was a good day.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — By the start of Nebraska’s next license plate cycle in 2029, the state could only issue drivers a rear-facing license plate and allow multiyear registrations.
State lawmakers gave near-unanimous approval Thursday, on a 46-0 vote, to approve Legislative Bill 97 led by State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha. It included the new license plate change from State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area (originally LB 297) and the multiyear registration allowance from State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk (originally LB 543).

Von Gillern said he brought his change partly because it is often the “norm” for new cars to no longer have brackets or mounts for front-facing license plates.
He said that means some new car owners are left with three options:

Pay the car dealership an average of $100 to furnish and install a front plate holder.
Pay a $50 annual fee for a windshield decal conferring the right to display just a rear plate.
Drill holes in the front bumper of someone’s “dream” car.

Von Gillern said his bill, originally LB 297, could save taxpayer dollars by not issuing dual license plates to about 2 million vehicles in the state. Nebraskans currently pay $4.10 per license plate, leading to potential savings of about $8 million. Nebraskans incarcerated at the Nebraska State Penitentiary manufacture state plates. New car buyers could also save about $6 million to $8 million, von Gillern estimated.
His bill could also have an environmental benefit, von Gillern said, reducing 200 tons of aluminum mined. At least 26 other states no longer require front-facing plates.
Law enforcement officials from the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office and the Omaha Police Officer’s Association have testified neutral or in support of similar legislation in recent years. Von Gillern’s proposal was added to LB 97 during first-round debate in a 30-5 vote.
Under Dover’s bill, auto owners could pay up to three years of registration taxes or fees in advance, giving them the chance to save if local taxes or fees increased in future years.
Lawmakers during debate Thursday also passed LB 113 from State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, which would allow licensed craft breweries to operate up to eight separate retail locations (up from five) and allow such license holders to directly sell for resale up to 3,500 gallons of microdistilled products (up from 500 gallons) each year to retail licensees in the state.
  State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, March 31, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln led opposition to the bill, as she’s done during each of the bill’s three stages of debate. She alleged it would give “preferential treatment” to in-state operators compared to out-of-state or regional distributors, risking a lawsuit.
“It is only a matter of time that some regional distributor that plays by all the rules and adheres to the regulations and standards gets frustrated and files a lawsuit,” Raybould said.
The longtime grocery store executive sought an attorney general’s opinion on whether LB 113 could increase the risk of a lawsuit against the state’s craft brewery laws on the grounds of violating the constitutional clause about regulating commerce over state lines. Raybould argued the lawsuit could undo some of the state’s other alcohol-related laws.
Quick told his colleagues to remember that they were discussing Nebraska small businesses and that lawmakers had added an earlier amendment to protect other statutes if LB 113 was ever challenged and ruled unconstitutional.
“This is a good bill,” Quick said. “It will help a lot of our Nebraska businesses grow their business model.”
  State Sen.-elect Dan Quick of Grand Island. Dec. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman also defended the proposal. She said it had gone through “significant compromises” from its original version and was “just government allowing someone to distribute their own product to the retail market without being forced to pay a middleman some fee to distribute that for them.”
The bill passed 33-13 — six senators were present but did not vote, which, under a legislative rule adopted earlier this year for final reading votes, meant their votes had to be categorized as “no” votes.
The Legislature also approved Thursday:

LB 390, from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, to require that public schools by the start of the 2026-27 school year publicly catalog all library books by school building. Parents could opt-in to be notified via email of when their child checks out a book, including the title, author name and the book due date. It passed 34-14.
LB 457, from State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, to cap out-of-pocket costs for medically necessary epinephrine injectors, such as EpiPens, to no more than $60 for a two-pack. It also would require the state’s health and education agencies to create model policies for schools and licensed child care programs for responding to severe allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. It passed 47-1.

If the Senate and governor approve as well, House Bill 282 will double the total cap the state can pay out to all injured first responders through this benefit program from $500,000 to $1 million every two years.
The vote goes against the wishes of the majority in the House Labor, Industrial, and Rehabilitative Services Committee, which voted, 11-9, in February to recommend that the full House reject the bill. Legislators opposed to the bill argued it was unnecessary after they heard testimony in January from Brian Ryll, president of the Professional Firefighters of New Hampshire and captain of the Portsmouth Fire Department, that the state has yet to hit this $500,000 cap.
However, the Finance Committee, which also reviewed this legislation, voted unanimously, 25-0, to recommend approval in March.
Ryll, despite noting that the state hasn’t yet hit the current cap, was in favor of the bill because he believes the benefit will be paid out more over time as more first responders become aware of it. Legislators in favor of the bill pointed out how inherently dangerous jobs in firefighting and law enforcement are, and how injuries can require extensive medical treatment and be a financial burden on first responders’ families.
The First Responder’s Critical Injury Benefit was created through a 2014 piece of legislation following the grisly shooting of Manchester Police Officer Daniel Doherty. The benefit’s cap has never been increased before.
Through the benefit, each individual injured firefighter is eligible to receive up to $125,000, and the state is currently allowed to distribute a total of $500,000 to all firefighters. This bill would double that amount.

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted, 193-177, Thursday to kill a bipartisan proposal aimed at strengthening child abuse and neglect training among medical providers.
Rep. Carol McGuire, an Epsom Republican, called the bill “a very well-meaning bill that is totally impossible to implement” and “unnecessary.”
House Bill 493, sponsored by Concord Democrat Rep. Gabby Grossman, would’ve required physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants treating patients age 18 or younger to complete child abuse and neglect education. That education would’ve had to be at least one hour, and be accredited and recognized by the New Hampshire chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics as addressing the necessary subject matter. The bill was amended since it was first introduced.
McGuire took issue with the fact that the bill has the Board of Medicine mandating the training for nurse practitioners, who are governed by the Board of Nursing. She also noted that the Board of Medicine and Board of Nursing can both already require this training themselves, and she said she’s heard from the employers of doctors and nurse practitioners who say they already often require their employees to do this type of training. She pointed out that a version of the training has already been made available for free online — by HB 493’s sponsors — that providers can decide to do on their own.
Still, supporters wanted the training mandated and didn’t want to wait on the boards or employers of providers.
“This bill is the result of findings that include that there are New Hampshire children that have been abused or neglected but have been missed or not reported by New Hampshire health providers with tragic outcomes,” one of the bill’s supporters, Derry Republican Rep. Jodi Nelson, said. “And that voluntary training in identifying and reporting child abuse and neglect has been made available to New Hampshire health care providers but very few have enrolled.”
Nelson said she’d heard stories of infants arriving at the hospital with atypical bruises and debilitating disabilities that weren’t reported to the authorities at the Division for Children, Youth, and Families. She said the issue “isn’t New Hampshire specific; it’s a problem throughout the U.S.”
This isn’t the first time lawmakers have tried to enact this rule. In 2024, House Bill 1590, a similar piece of legislation, was introduced in the House but failed to become law.

The Republican president and Democratic governor had engaged in years of public condemnations of one another’s policies mainly starting during the COVID-19 pandemic when Trump zeroed in on Whitmer in 2020 as “the woman in Michigan…way in over her head” as she instituted stay-at-home orders during the pandemic to slow the spread of the deadly virus.
But on Wednesday, Trump hosted Whitmer in the Oval Office as an “honored” guest as he signed an executive order to address the issue of invasive Asian Carp in the Great Lakes, saying Whitmer is a “very good person” who has done “an excellent job” in Michigan. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) was also present and thanked Trump for his advocacy on the issue.

Whitmer, who participated in former President Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign as well as former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign as a vocal Democrat, has often denounced Trump over his abortion policies and other platforms, making her recent actions engaging his administration unexpected for many.
Last month, Whitmer used her annual State of the State Address to say she hopes to “find common ground with President Trump” for the good of the state of Michigan which has a strong history of operating at a state level with a partisanly split government.
Through the years Whitmer has taken criticisms and hot mic moments in stride, accepting titles like “Big Gretch” and has become one of the most influential elected officials in the Democratic Party, with speculations that she’ll make a run for the presidency in 2028.
Earlier in the day Wednesday, Whitmer delivered a speech in Washington D.C. calling for a carveout in Trump’s tariffs that have caused economic upheaval in order to allow the auto and energy industries to be resilient towards anticipated economic losses. When asked about possible presidential ambitions, Whitmer dismissed the notion.
“No, no. This is my way of saying —this is similar to speeches that I’ve given in Michigan too, by the way — this is, I think, a blueprint for success,” she said.

(Photo courtesy Western New Mexico University)Western New Mexico University’s new board of regents met for the first time Wednesday, setting plans for a search for a new university president and a forensic audit of university finances.
Lawmakers confirmed the four new regents during the recent legislative session in the aftermath of allegations of financial malfeasance by the previous board and university administrators. 
A civil lawsuit filed by Attorney General Raúl Torrez in January against the former university leaders remains pending, with a June hearing scheduled on former President Joseph Shepard’s motion to dismiss the charges against him, which include violations of fiduciary duties, the state’s anti-donation clause, the Open Meetings Act and several laws involving unjust enrichment, and not fulfilling contractual obligations. Torrez filed the suit in January after the previous board voted to award Shepard a $1.9 million severance package, which Torrez called a golden parachute and a misuse of state funds.
John Wertheim, a lawyer and one of the four new regents, reiterated during the meeting that the university is undergoing a period of many changes.
“I want to express to everybody how unusual this situation is,” Wertheim said during the meeting. “To have a university with constitutional stature like Western New Mexico to be operating for even a few months without a board of regents is pretty unprecedented.”
Steven Neville, a former state senator who represented Senate District 2 in San Juan County, said the board will research how to move forward with a search for a new president. Jack Crocker, university provost and vice president of academic affairs, has been serving as interim president, but was not officially appointed by the previous board of regents. Neville said board members want to move quickly to find someone to take over during the interim while a formal search for president is conducted.
The board also received updates on the regular and forensic audit of the school’s finances. Scott Peck, an independent auditor, told regents the regular audit, which is conducted each year, came back clean with no issues found. He explained that this regular audit tests certain areas including federal funding, major transactions such as payroll and cash disbursements. 
The forensic audit, which the university started voluntarily in 2023 and was later required by the New Mexico Office of the State Auditor, is still underway and involves a more in-depth analysis. Kelly Riddle, vice president of business affairs for the university, said the Jaramillo Accounting Group in Albuquerque was chosen to conduct the audit and the group is specifically investigating finances between July 1, 2027 and Dec. 31, 2024.
Scott Eliason, a representative of the accounting firm, confirmed that the forensic audit will take several more months to complete, and said the firm will deliver a report to the regents with its findings, as well as suggestions for improving the use of finances.
“We are diving deep into the details,” Eliason told the board. “ We’ve got stacks and stacks of travel documents, for example, in one of the conference rooms. We’ve got a couple of team members on site right now going through those documents, reviewing for certain attributes and conformance with the university’s policies and procedures.”
Neville said all four regents called for a forensic audit during their confirmation hearings in the legislative session, to ensure any previous wrongdoing is identified and fixed moving forward.
The board of regents will meet again on April 29 to discuss the university budget.

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)PHOENIX — The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.

The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.
Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.
And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

,DC,2025-04-10 15:37:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump-supported budget squeaks by in U.S. House after GOP assurances of vast spending cuts,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-supported-budget-squeaks-us-house-after-gop-assurances-vast-spending-cuts,,"This story was updated at 11:54 a.m. EDT.WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans adopted a budget resolution Thursday, clearing the way for both chambers of Congress to write a bill extending 2017 tax cuts and bolstering funding for border security and defense, though the blueprint set vastly different targets for spending cuts.The cliff-hanger 216-214 vote followed a tumultuous week on Capitol Hill. Far-right members of the GOP Conference said repeatedly they wouldn't accept the outline, since it requires the House to write a bill that cuts spending by at least $1.5 trillion, while senators set themselves a floor of $4 billion in cuts.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was forced to postpone a floor vote on the budget resolution on Wednesday evening. But Johnson was able to secure the votes needed after he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., announced Thursday morning that they were in agreement about meeting the higher threshold for spending cuts.Johnson said both chambers of Congress “are committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people, while also preserving our essential programs.”“Many of us are going to aim much higher and find those savings because we believe they are there,” Johnson said. “We want to make the government more efficient, effective and leaner for the American people. And I think that will serve every American of every party. And we’re happy to do that.”Despite the difference in reconciliation instructions, Thune said the Senate is “aligned with the House” when it comes to cutting spending over the next decade.“The speaker has talked about $1.5 trillion,” Thune said. “We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum.”Thune added he believes it's time for Congress “to get the country on a more sustainable fiscal path and that entails us taking a hard scrub of our government and figuring out where we can find those savings.”Democrats, and some centrist Republicans, have expressed deep concerns the House’s instructions require the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, to cut at least $880 billion.The panel, which also oversees Medicare and other programs, could not recoup that level of spending without pulling hundreds of billions from Medicaid, the state-federal program for lower-income Americans and some people with disabilities.The budget resolution has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, who’s repeatedly urged the House to adopt the measure. “Great News! “The Big, Beautiful Bill” is coming along really well. Republicans are working together nicely. Biggest Tax Cuts in USA History!!! Getting close. DJT,” Trump posted on social media Thursday morning prior to the vote.Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz were the only members of the Republican Party to vote against approval.“If you were trying to hasten financial collapse of our country and bribe voters to go along with it, the strategy wouldn’t look much different than what Congress is doing today,” Massie wrote on social media. “The big beautiful bill cuts taxes while keeping spending on an increasingly unsustainable trajectory.”Spartz wrote in a social media post of her own that the reconciliation instructions “we voted on today are still setting us up for the largest deficit increase in the history of our Republic, & opening up a ‘pandora’s box’ by changing accounting rules to hide it.“In good conscience, I couldn’t vote YES.”Only a beginningThe House adopting the 68-page budget resolution only marks the start of the months-long journey of writing and voting on the reconciliation package.Republicans hope to use that bill to permanently extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars and rework energy policy.The budget resolution includes different budget targets for many of those goals, and for raising the debt limit. It calls on the House to increase the country’s borrowing authority by $4 trillion, while the Senate’s instructions say that chamber would lift the debt ceiling by up to $5 trillion.Writing the various elements of the reconciliation package will fall to 11 committee chairs in the House and 10 committee leaders in the Senate, as well as Johnson, Thune and a lot of staffers.In the House, the Agriculture Committee needs to slice at least $230 billion; Education and Workforce must reduce spending by a minimum of $330 billion; Energy and Commerce needs to cut no less than $880 billion; Financial Services must find at least $1 billion in savings; Natural Resources has a minimum of $1 billion; Oversight and Government Reform has a floor of $50 billion; and the Transportation Committee needs to reduce deficits by $10 billion or more.Four Senate committees — Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP — must each find at least $1 billion in spending cuts over the 10-year budget window.House committees that can increase the federal deficit include the Armed Services Committee with a cap of $100 billion in new spending, Homeland Security with a $90 billion ceiling for new funding for programs it oversees, Judiciary with a maximum of $110 billion and Ways and Means, which can increase deficits up to $4.5 trillion for tax cuts.Senate committees also got instructions for increasing the deficit, which will allow them to spend up to the dollar amount outlined in the budget resolution. Those committees include Armed Services at $150 billion; Commerce, Science and Transportation with $20 billion; Environment and Public Works at $1 billion; Finance with $1.5 trillion in new deficits, likely for tax cuts; Homeland Security at $175 billion and Judiciary with $175 billion.The back storyIf the process to reach agreement on a final reconciliation package is anything like the path to adopting the budget resolution, it will be long, winding and filled with drama.The Senate voted for a completely different budget resolution in February that would have set up Congress to enact Republicans’ agenda in two reconciliation bills instead of one.Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., referred to the reconciliation instructions in that budget proposal as “Plan B.”That tax-and-spending blueprint would have had lawmakers first write a bill increasing funding for border security and defense, and rewriting energy policy, before debating another bill later in the year to extend the 2017 tax law and cut federal spending.The House voted about a week later to approve its original budget resolution, but not without a bit of theatrics.Johnson didn’t originally have the votes and opted to recess the chamber before calling lawmakers back about 15 minutes later to approve that version of the budget resolution.The Senate made changes to its reconciliation instructions in the House-approved budget resolution, before voting to send it back across the Capitol for their colleagues to vote on final approval, which they did Thursday.Politically difficult votes aheadEach time the Senate voted on a budget resolution it undertook a marathon amendment voting session, known as a vote-a-rama, where lawmakers stay on the floor overnight to debate various aspects of the outline.Senators will need to undertake one more of those when they debate the actual reconciliation package later this year, though the stakes will be much higher.The budget resolution is a blueprint for how Congress wants to shape tax and spending policy during the 10-year budget window. It’s not a bill so it never becomes law. And it contains no actual money, it’s simply a plan for how lawmakers want to structure policy.The reconciliation package, once written, will have the chance of becoming law, so any amendments offered during the Senate’s vote-a-rama will carry greater weight than the proposals voted on when the chamber took up the two budget resolutions.Democrats will have an opportunity to challenge centrist GOP senators on whether they support or want to remove every single policy that Republicans put in their reconciliation package.That could create real issues for GOP leadership if they include tax policy or spending cuts that cannot garner the backing of senators like Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, Maine’s Susan Collins and others.The final reconciliation package will need support from nearly every Republican in Congress. GOP leaders will not be able to lose more than three House lawmakers or three Republican senators, under their very slender majorities. Four or more Republicans opposing the reconciliation package in one chamber, either because it cuts too much spending or doesn’t cut enough, would likely prevent it from becoming law.",,,,2025-04-10 13:15:36.781389

In a tight budget year, Senate Republicans opted to keep current eligibility requirements. 
The difference for funding virtual students was even more stark: House Republicans sought to increase the reimbursement from 85% of an in-person student to 100%. Senators, on the other hand, proposed a cut to 70%, alluding to concerns about accountability amid an ongoing corruption investigation into a now-closed virtual school.
Overall, K-12 schools will see the same 2% baseline increase each year — with additional dollars to offset curriculum costs, though schools have previously shared concerns about whether the funds would be sufficient.  
Similar to earlier versions of the budget, spending increases were largely absorbed by three different line items: Medicaid, the Department of Child Services and the Department of Correction. 
But the bill is far from finalized. A new two-year revenue forecast is scheduled for April 16, which could shift how much money lawmakers have to spend.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)In the wake of North Carolina’s recent Supreme Court election, the only fraud the public should be concerned about is the baseless lawsuit filed by the Republican candidate, Judge Jefferson Griffin. His legal challenge seeks to overturn the results of a fair and settled election by targeting 65,000 legally cast votes—mine among them.
Let me be clear: I registered to vote in June 2011 and have voted in every election since. In November, I cast my ballot early and complied with every legal requirement, including the new voter ID law. I even obtained a copy of my original voter registration from the Board of Elections—fully completed, entirely valid. Yet my vote is now under challenge. Why? I don’t know. I contacted the Griffin campaign three times and received no explanation. None.
Voters like me were not given fair notice or clear information about how or why our ballots were being questioned. This is not how democracy is supposed to work.
Griffin’s lawsuit is not about protecting election integrity. It’s about overturning an outcome he doesn’t like. A pair of judges on a North Carolina Court of Appeals panel suggested that if even one ballot were improperly cast, the entire election would be void. That’s an outrageous and dangerous precedent. There has been no proven fraud—none. And it defies logic and fairness to throw out 65,000 votes in an election decided by a few hundred.
Let’s call this what it is: a political temper tantrum dressed up as a legal argument. Griffin refuses to concede, consumed by the delusion that he can invalidate tens of thousands of law-abiding citizens’ votes simply because he lost. This isn’t just petty—it’s perilous.
What does it say about a would-be justice that he would pursue power through such means? If Griffin is seated on the North Carolina Supreme Court, how can anyone trust his rulings to be impartial? He has shown he is willing to twist the rules and cast aside democratic norms for his own gain.
Meanwhile, Justice Allison Riggs—the actual winner—has demonstrated the very integrity our courts depend on. Her decision to recuse herself from ruling on the case only underscores her commitment to justice. But make no mistake: she has every right to defend the voters who elected her.
North Carolina deserves better than this political circus. We deserve leaders who respect the will of the people. Griffin should step aside and allow the rightful winner to take her seat on the bench.
The only fraud here is the claim that 65,000 lawful votes should be erased.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2170462-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-10 13:15:36.781389

Chronic absenteeism in Connecticut peaked at nearly 20.2% in February — meaning that over 98,000 children missed 10% or more of their in-class instruction time, an increase of over 7,200 students from January, when the rate was 18.7%, and the first time the rate has surpassed 20% since May 2023.
Connecticut is just one of three states and Washington D.C., that reports absenteeism on a monthly basis, which has allowed the state Education Department to “know in real time what’s happening and how to intervene,” Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said.
“It’s the highest number that we’ve seen in quite some time,” Russell-Tucker said. “It certainly got our attention.”
“We heard that some of this is due to just a bad respiratory sickness this time of year, but we also heard that some of this could also be some issues around immigration,” she said.
Since the November election, schools have reported rising fears of mass deportation in their communities. Then, shortly after President Donald J. Trump took office in January, his administration announced that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protections officers could make arrests at schools, churches and hospitals — places that had long been considered “sensitive locations” and barred from immigration enforcement. 
The action raised flags for educators who argued the measure would lead to attendance issues. Across the country, state departments of education quickly offered guidance to local districts on how to handle immigration enforcement.
But despite a reaffirmed commitment to student safety from the Connecticut Department of Education — which stressed that both state and federal law “protect a student’s right to attend public schools, regardless of their immigration status” — it’s unclear if officials’ reassurances have persuaded undocumented parents that they should continue sending their children to school.
“There is significant fear in our communities that’s impacting kids attending school and resulting in families not feeling comfortable sending them to school,” said Sabrina Tavi, a senior attorney and director of the Immigrant Children’s Justice Project at the Center for Children’s Advocacy. “There’s much more concern now during this Trump administration versus the first one.”
‘The fear is real’
Most school districts with the largest concentrations of immigrant students had much larger increases of chronic absenteeism since January than the statewide average, data from the Connecticut Department of Education shows.
Statewide, Connecticut had an increase of 1.5% in chronic absenteeism between January and February, but districts including Bridgeport, Danbury, Hartford, New Haven and Stamford saw the figure rise between 2.4% and 4.4%.
Compared to the last two previous academic years, this year’s January-February jump remains an outlier.
Hartford, for example, had a 1.7% district-wide increase in chronic absenteeism in 2023 between January and February. This year, the district had an increase of nearly 4%, or nearly 600 more students.
Stamford had a 1.6% increase in 2023 and a slight 0.7% decrease the following year between January and February, but this year’s jump was 2.8%.
“The fear has always been there … the Biden administration was still deporting folks, [but] it was just not at the scale that it is right now, and there was not, at the time, the anti-immigrant rhetoric,” said Barbara Lopez, the Executive Director at Make the Road CT, a nonprofit that supports immigrant families. “Whole family units are being targeted. … There is a lot of conversation around supporting not just individuals but whole family units now.”
Sonia Hernandez, a Bridgeport community organizer with Make the Road, said she’s seen a range of responses from families — some who are continuing to send their kids to school despite “being terrified,” some who are opting to keep their children at home and some who have even packed their bags to return back to their native country and decided the risk wasn’t worth it.
“The fear is real, especially for new arrivals, but also the community that has been here for the first administration,” Hernandez said. “It’s not just impacting school, it’s impacting everything.”
Even though Bridgeport Public Schools issued the first statement in Connecticut reaffirming the district’s “commitment to protecting the safety and privacy of all students and families,” at a local board of education meeting on Jan. 21, Hernandez said families are still weighing their options.
“[The district] did help reinforce trust, but … the fear is still there,” Hernandez said. “Even with all [the training and reassurance], our community is still afraid of showing up to places … and what can happen.”
There are hints, however, that more direct contact with parents may be the key to bringing students back to their schools.
An outlier
Most urban hubs in Connecticut have similar enrollment demographics, but Waterbury was the only district among its peers to see a decline in chronic absenteeism from January to February of this year.
Sandra Romero, the district’s family and community engagement manager, said the attendance improvement is primarily due to earlier intervention, before a student is identified as chronically absent, and long-term efforts to develop interpersonal relationships among the district, principals and parents.
When immigration enforcement threats began trickling down from the federal government, Romero said, several school principals “were able to pick up on the relationship they already have and continue building on them to provide a safety zone.”
“If a family has trust in you, that family is going to send those students to school. Obviously, there’s some families that, because they’re still scared, choose not to, but then that’s when the whole team from the school community steps in to guide and to help the families make that decision of sending them to school,” Romero said.
This means a principal might “directly call to speak to the parent to get more information around what’s going on,” Romero added. “It’s not accusatory, it’s more understanding … [and] developing a plan with a family. … I know in some schools that they have asked, ‘Would you like someone to go pick up the child?’ Because even families are afraid of stepping out of their home.”
Tavi, of the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said she was optimistic that chronic absenteeism among students who are immigrants or children of immigrant parents will stabilize — as it has in some districts, like Waterbury — if school is seen “as a safe place where they can get some of their basic needs addressed.”
Waterbury’s family-centered approach is similar to a state-launched at-home visiting program called Learner Engagement and Attendance Program (LEAP) that was started in April 2021 to tackle absenteeism.
Education officials say the program is a key contributor to the state’s steady decline in chronic absenteeism from its peak of 26.1% in January 2022.
“With 71,000 home visits actually done, engaging directly families and students, to build trusting relationships and to strengthen connections with schools, we know it works,” Russell-Tucker said in late March in a call for more funding toward the program.
Democratic state lawmakers have also prioritized expanding The Trust Act this year, which is legislation that prohibits local and state law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from ICE that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up. A bill supported by Democrats would further prohibit public agencies from sharing information about a person’s home address, workplace, school or “the date, time or location of a person’s hearings, proceedings or appointments with the public agency.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023_0621_SR_SchoolConstructionMugs001-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

(Justin Rex/For The Texas Tribune)Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.
Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(File photo by Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)When my infertility journey began back in 2015, no one I knew was talking about it.
It felt like this secret club no one wanted to admit they were in.
That’s why I’m so proud that, thanks to recent advocacy efforts, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a proclamation (provided below) officially recognizing National Infertility Awareness Week, which will be observed April 20–26.
It’s a powerful step in acknowledging that infertility is real; it’s medical; and it affects 1 in 7 couples in the U.S. — including me.
Awareness about infertility is just the beginning.
Because of my infertility, I tried multiple treatment options — including four rounds of intrauterine insemination (IUI) and three rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF).
In the end, we walked away with one living child and one miscarriage that required a dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedure.
We paid 100% out of pocket for treatment because, as a military family, we don’t have insurance coverage for infertility care unless it’s due to a direct injury to reproductive organs.
That’s something most people don’t realize. And it’s just one example of how broken and inconsistent the system is when it comes to supporting people who want to build a family.
That’s part of what drives me today.
I now run my own business, Empowered Infertility, as an IVF mindset coach and host the “More Than Your Infertility” podcast.
Since 2019, I have worked with women all over the country to help them emotionally navigate the IVF rollercoaster — because I know firsthand how hard it is and how isolating it can feel.
Recently, I participated in a federal advocacy day through Resolve (the national infertility association) where I met with South Carolina legislators alongside other residents impacted by infertility. We shared our stories — the heartbreak, the medical treatments, the financial burden — all in hopes of helping lawmakers understand what’s at stake.
One of the people who joined us was a hopeful grandmother from the Lowcountry.
Her son and daughter-in-law are currently going through IVF to try to start a family — to make her a grandma. And she wanted lawmakers to know that even as a Catholic, she fully supports access to IVF care.
Her voice reminded me that this issue crosses political, religious, and generational lines. It’s about people, not parties.
That’s why I’m grateful for the work of the Women’s Rights and Empowerment Network (WREN).
WREN has been a tireless force in South Carolina for years, helping to secure access to contraception, protect bodily autonomy, and defend the right to make informed reproductive decisions.
They’ve helped pass laws like the Pharmacy Access Act, which allows pharmacists to prescribe birth control directly — a huge win for health care access in our state.
Now, WREN is helping lead the effort to protect IVF, and they’re showing everyday people like me how to use our stories to make a difference — even if we don’t have a background in politics.
And here’s the thing: You don’t have to testify at the Statehouse or publish an op-ed to make your voice count. If you’re in the thick of treatments right now, just getting through the day is enough — I’ve got you.
But if you’re on the other side, or you know someone who’s walked this path, now is the time to speak up.
Infertility and IVF are no longer topics whispered about in secrecy.
More and more people are finding the courage to share — not just publicly, but in everyday conversations.
Start with your inner circle. Talk to your friends, your coworkers, your community.
When lawmakers hear from people they know and love, it changes everything.
IVF isn’t a first option. It’s often the last resort after years of trying less invasive treatments.
It’s not a luxury. It’s a medical treatment option. It’s a lifeline. And it deserves to be protected.
As we recognize National Infertility Awareness Week here in South Carolina, let’s do more than acknowledge the problem.
Let’s support the people going through it. Let’s protect access to IVF for all the people who will need it and don’t even know it.
And let’s make sure our lawmakers understand: Infertility is a medical diagnosis that doesn’t discriminate — and neither should our laws.


Let us know what you think...

He had taken anger management classes, learned a trade and enrolled in drug treatment. And as his September hearing before the board approached, his disciplinary record was clean.

This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with Verite News. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published. 

Alexander, more than midway through a 20-year prison sentence on drug charges, was making preparations for what he hoped would be his new life. His daughter, with whom he had only recently become acquainted, had even made up a room for him in her New Orleans home.
Then, two months before the hearing date, prison officials sent Alexander a letter informing him he was no longer eligible for parole.
A computerized scoring system adopted by the state Department of Public Safety and Corrections had deemed the nearly blind 70-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, a moderate risk of reoffending, should he be released. And under a new law, that meant he and thousands of other prisoners with moderate or high risk ratings cannot plead their cases before the board. According to the department of corrections, about 13,000 people — nearly half the state’s prison population — have such risk ratings, although not all of them are eligible for parole.
Alexander said he felt “betrayed” upon learning his hearing had been canceled. “People in jail have … lost hope in being able to do anything to reduce their time,” he said.

The law that changed Alexander’s prospects is part of a series of legislation passed by Louisiana Republicans last year reflecting Gov. Jeff Landry’s tough-on-crime agenda to make it more difficult for prisoners to be released. 
While campaigning for governor, Landry, a former police officer and sheriff’s deputy who served as Louisiana attorney general until 2024, championed a crackdown on rewarding well-behaved prisoners with parole. Landry said early release, which until now has been typically assumed when judges hand down sentences, is a slap in the face to crime victims.
“The revolving door is insulting,” Landry told state lawmakers last year as he kicked off a special legislative session on crime during which he blamed the state’s high violent crime rate on lenient sentences and “misguided post-conviction programs” that fail to rehabilitate prisoners. (In fact, Louisiana’s recidivism rate has declined over the past decade, according to a 2024 department of corrections report.)
The Legislature eliminated parole for nearly everyone imprisoned for crimes committed after Aug. 1, making Louisiana the 17th state in a half-century to abolish parole altogether and the first in 24 years to do so. For the vast majority of prisoners who were already behind bars, like Alexander, another law put an algorithm in charge of determining whether they have a shot at early release; only prisoners rated low risk qualify for parole.
That decision makes Louisiana the only state to use risk scores to automatically rule out large portions of a prison population from being considered for parole, according to seven national criminal justice experts.

  Calvin Alexander can’t read or write, so he dictated answers to mailed questions from Verite News and ProPublica to a fellow prisoner.
That was not how the tool, known as TIGER, an acronym for Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry, was intended to be used. Developed as a rehabilitative measure about a decade ago, it was supposed to help prison officials determine what types of classes or counseling someone might need to prevent them from landing back behind bars — not be used as a punitive tool to keep them there, said one of its creators.
Criminal justice advocates and civil rights attorneys say the new law could disproportionately harm Black people like Alexander in part because the algorithm measures factors such as criminal history where racial disparities already exist. The law’s opponents also contend that the unique step Louisiana has taken to curtail parole is deeply problematic — and potentially unconstitutional — because it does not take into account the efforts of prisoners to better themselves while incarcerated. “They deserve that opportunity to show they’ve changed,” said Pearl Wise, who was appointed to the parole board by Landry’s Democratic predecessor and served from 2016 until 2023. “You demonstrate over time the changes that you made and that you are not the person that was sentenced on that day.”

An immutable risk score
Alexander is like thousands of prisoners who have previously appeared before the board — repeat offenders accused of nonviolent crimes, often mired in addiction with limited education or learning disabilities. Alexander can’t read or write, having dropped out of school as a fourth grader in the early 1960s. He needed to help support his family in deeply segregated Mississippi and turned to selling crack cocaine as a child. That period was also the start of his own lifelong struggle with narcotics that resulted in multiple arrests and extended stints in prison.
The department of corrections would not allow an in-person or phone interview with Alexander. Instead, Verite News and ProPublica mailed Alexander written questions, which a fellow inmate read to him and then wrote down his responses. Alexander admitted he was reckless in his youth and that he had violated his parole — related to a 1994 drug possession conviction — by drinking and staying out after curfew. That mistake would prove devastating three decades later because a prisoner’s history of parole violations plays a significant role in their TIGER risk score.
Louisiana’s TIGER scoring system was born out of a 2014 federal initiative to help states reduce their prison populations. The risk assessment tool, developed by the state department of corrections and Louisiana State University researchers using a $1.75 million federal grant, was meant to “treat criminal thinking,” said Keith Nordyke, one of the creators of TIGER. For populations with the highest risk of reoffending, he said, the prison would flood them with services — addiction counseling, therapy, job training — to help keep them out of trouble once they were freed.
“The whole purpose of this was to slow down the revolving door,” Nordyke said.
Louisiana corrections officials started using the TIGER scores as part of the parole determination process in 2018, but it was only in 2024 that they became the sole  measure of parole eligibility.
Similar algorithms are used throughout the country in the parole decision-making process, but legal scholars say the way such risk tools calculate a person’s odds of reoffending is among the reasons why no other state exclusively uses them to bar individuals from parole. While algorithms like TIGER can predict on a group level that 40 out of 100 people will reoffend upon their release, they can’t pinpoint exactly who those 40 people will be, according to experts.
The Louisiana department of corrections declined multiple interview requests and did not respond to questions about the state’s use of the risk tool.
The reliance on a TIGER score to potentially block a prisoner’s bid for freedom is especially concerning, experts on risk assessment tools say, because most of the factors considered by the algorithm — the crimes they committed, work history, age at first arrest, whether they had any marijuana-related convictions, prior parole revocations — are from a prisoner’s past, which cannot be changed; they do not include anything related to what people have done in prison to rehabilitate themselves.
Criminal justice scholars say that when scores based on immutable facts are weighted so heavily in parole decisions, prisoners from impoverished, racially segregated communities are more likely to be hurt.

  A fellow inmate wrote down Calvin Alexander’s answers to Verite and ProPublica’s questions on what he misses and what he would have done had he been granted parole.
Take the algorithm’s use of prior employment data: People raised in low-income communities do not have the same work opportunities as those brought up in more affluent neighborhoods, said Megan Stevenson, an economist and criminal justice professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Using such an algorithm to determine someone’s chances of parole, she said, “suggests that poor people should be less eligible for parole than wealthier people.”
Factoring in prior drug convictions, too, is more likely to impact Black prisoners, Stevenson said. Black people use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate as white people, but are arrested and convicted for it in greater numbers because their neighborhoods are more heavily policed, she said.
In using these data points to produce a risk score, “you’re going to create a biased algorithm to make biased decisions,” Stevenson said.
Already, Black people account for nearly two-thirds of Louisiana’s prison population, more than double their share of the state population.
The Landry administration did not respond to requests for comment regarding potential racial biases in the way the TIGER scores are used for parole.
Louisiana’s legislation might also violate the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits laws that retroactively increase the severity of a person’s criminal sentence, according to several legal scholars. Tying parole eligibility to a computerized risk score that can’t be lowered by an inmate through good behavior or other actions appears to do just that since the opportunity for parole has traditionally been considered part of a sentence, said Sonja Starr, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.
Some former Louisiana parole board members also bristled at the idea of an algorithm superseding human judgment.
“It doesn’t make much sense to me that a score generated by a process that the inmate has no control over takes away the authority and the power of the parole board,” said Keith Jones, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and served on the board from 2018 to 2020. “Why have a parole board?”
Jones and two other former parole board members said the introduction of the TIGER tool as part of parole determination wasn’t in itself a bad thing, as long as it remained just one factor to be considered among many.
Although some board members did refuse to parole anyone with a moderate or high risk score before the law took effect, the state’s parole board had much more discretion in determining when a prisoner was released, former board members said.
Tony Marabella, a former East Baton Rouge criminal court judge who served on the parole board until last year, said he had placed greater emphasis on a prisoner’s disciplinary record and completion of self-improvement programs. He also took into account whether the warden or victims supported their release when deciding whether to grant parole.
“If someone was a moderate risk, I wasn’t going to throw them out,” said Marabella, who served on the board for four years under Edwards. “I was more concerned about what they had accomplished.”

  Alonzo Allen, outside of his home in Mansfield, was paroled nearly four years ago. He had a moderate risk assessment score, which, after the passage of a 2024 law, would now prohibit him from appearing before the board. (Kathleen Flynn for ProPublica)
That’s exactly what Alonzo Allen was able to show.
In 2021, three years before the new law went into effect, Allen succeeded in convincing the parole board that he was worthy of release — despite having the same TIGER score and a similar criminal history as Alexander.
Allen had been sentenced to 40 years behind bars in 2012 on multiple drug charges and carrying a gun. While in prison, he was written up for possessing contraband, including a pencil sharpener and $2 worth of sugar, and he previously had his parole revoked twice, according to Allen and the parole board.
As a result, he was marked a moderate risk.
During Allen’s parole hearing, Jerry Goodwin, then warden at the David Wade Correctional Center in Homer, where Allen was being held, lauded Allen for his tireless work overcoming his drug addictions and improving his communication skills. Goodwin noted that Allen took classes even when he knew he had reached his limit for “good time” credits, time shaved off a sentence for good behavior.
“He’s worked hard for this opportunity,” Goodwin told the parole board, “and I think he’s really got his best foot forward.”

Alvin Roché Jr., then a member of the parole board, questioned the accuracy of Allen’s TIGER score. “Is it possible that this instrument might be wrong?” Roché asked during Allen’s hearing. “You think you are rehabilitated to the point where you can prove that assessment wrong?”
“Yes, sir, very much, sir,” Allen responded. “I do think that is wrong.”
The board unanimously voted to parole Allen.
Speaking by telephone from his home in Mansfield, just south of Shreveport, Allen, 61, said he was grateful for the second chance. He’s stayed sober, works full time as a truck driver and has not violated the terms of his parole in the nearly four years since his release.
“God has been good,” he said.

Steeply declining parole hearings
Lawmakers who supported Louisiana’s push to place strict limits on parole have maintained that relying on the algorithm over human judgment was the most efficient way to clear a backlog of parole applications.
State Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, the bill’s author, claimed during a Senate committee hearing in February 2024 that so many unrealistic parole petitions were coming before the board that prisoners most deserving of early release were not being prioritized.
“What I’m really trying to do here is make the system run more efficiently and effectively,” McMath said.
But data from the parole board doesn’t support his assertion. According to the parole board’s annual reports, the number of cases heard by the board actually dropped by 40% between 2016 and 2023.
Prison reform advocates and civil rights attorneys say McMath’s bill was never anything more than a Trojan horse designed to kill parole, given the law’s other requirements that make parole substantially harder to achieve, including a unanimous board vote before parole is granted and an increase in the number of years prisoners must maintain clean disciplinary records.
McMath declined to be interviewed and did not answer questions concerning the impact of his legislation.
Landry, who signed the legislation into law in March 2024, appointed five new people to the seven-member board. None of the seven were permitted to comment about the use of TIGER to deny prisoners parole, according to Francis M. Abbott, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole, citing board policy. Instead, he provided a statement from board chair Sheryl Ranatza: “We believe Governor Landry’s reforms passed in the special crime session will enhance public safety.”
The average number of people paroled in Louisiana has already dropped from 32 per month in 2023 to six per month since the law went into effect in August, according to Department of Corrections data. And at least 70 parole hearings, including Alexander’s, were canceled between Aug. 1 and Dec. 13 because of the prisoner’s risk score, according to the parole board.
Opponents of the bill predict the new restrictions on parole will swell the state’s prison population, costing taxpayers billions of dollars to build new corrections facilities and leading to more violence behind bars as inmates have fewer incentives to behave.
For Alexander, that means he will not have the same opportunity Allen did to show the parole board that he had heeded their advice to improve himself.

With his health rapidly deteriorating, his family fears he will not live to see the end of his sentence in five years. “He’s got one eye. He’s diabetic. He’s got poor circulation,” said Alexander’s daughter, Sabrina Brown. “I don’t want to have to go to a funeral for him.”
Instead of moving into Brown’s New Orleans home as planned, Alexander will be able to see his daughter only when she makes the 85-mile trek north to the Rayburn Correctional Center.
It wasn’t supposed to be this way, he said.
“They told me once I received my risk score there is nothing I can do to change it,” Alexander said. “It’s like walking into a brick wall.”

As the state continues to grapple with budgetary pressures, one solution on the table — cutting funding to nonprofits that serve our most vulnerable residents — comes at too high a cost. While we can all agree there’s room for reducing inefficiencies, eliminating “waste,” and curbing bureaucratic bloat, slashing support for frontline human services is a dangerous move that shifts the burden to systems that were never designed to bear it.
Nonprofit organizations across New Hampshire provide vital, life-sustaining services. They offer housing support, addiction treatment, food security, mental health care, services for older adults, and help for survivors of domestic violence, to name just a few. When these supports are defunded, the needs of vulnerable populations do not disappear. They show up elsewhere — on the steps of our emergency rooms, in the back seats of police cruisers, inside overcrowded jails, and on the shoulders of burned-out first responders.
These are not just theoretical consequences — they are happening now. Hospitals are increasingly filling the gap in mental health care. Police officers are expected to act as social workers and addiction counselors. Jails have become de facto shelters for those with untreated mental illness and chronic homelessness. These institutions are expensive, ill-equipped for this role, and often perpetuate trauma rather than resolve it.
We can debate policy. We can disagree on the role of government. But surely, we can agree that no one wins when a mother fleeing domestic violence has nowhere to go, when a veteran with PTSD is left to spiral untreated, or when an elder is forced into an emergency room bed because there are no home-based supports left.
Ironically, these cuts don’t save money — they merely shift costs downstream. A night in jail or a hospital stay costs exponentially more than preventive community-based care. By underfunding nonprofits, we are not trimming fat — we are eating into the muscle that sustains our communities.
This isn’t about ideology; it’s about humanity. Nonprofits are not line items to be slashed. They are lifelines — essential partners in our public health and safety infrastructure. They stabilize families, uplift communities, and prevent crises before they erupt. When we defund them, we destabilize the very systems that keep our state functional and compassionate.
Yes, we should strive for efficient and accountable service delivery. But we must also fund what works. And what works is investing in people, in prevention, and in the power of community.
Now is the time for leadership that sees beyond the ledger — to recognize that the price of disinvestment is paid in human suffering.

The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed Senate Bill 2159 to allow the Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks to study nuclear energy. 
The House passed the EERC bill 57-32. The bill previously passed the Senate 45-2. The bill returns to the Senate after being amended by the House. 
Advocates of nuclear research said North Dakota should not fall behind amid a resurgence of interest in nuclear energy. 
  Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby. (Photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)
“We need to be a part of the conversation,” said Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby. 
Nelson represents an area where the U.S. Department of Energy proposed drilling an exploratory borehole to test the stability of the rock for nuclear waste storage. 
After that proposal, North Dakota lawmakers sought to clarify the law related to high-level radioactive waste storage. A group of concerned citizens pushed for language in a bill approved in 2019 that prohibits “the placement, storage, exploration, testing, or disposal of high-level radioactive waste” in North Dakota.
The EERC research bill could lead to above-ground storage. Some opponents said they feared the bill could allow unwanted radioactive nuclear waste into the state. 
Nelson disagreed. 
“We do not want to become a dumping ground,” Nelson said. “I think the protections are there.” 
The protections include an amendment that the state Industrial Commission, in consultation with  the state’s High-Level Radioactive Waste Advisory Council, must approve any nuclear research that EERC proposes to do.
The EERC is designated as the State Energy Research Center with oversight by the Industrial Commission. EERC submitted testimony in support of the bill.
The EERC research bill was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, who chaired the Energy Development and Transmission Committee that examined the possibilities for nuclear energy between legislative sessions. 
North Dakota eyes next-generation nuclear as replacement for coal plants

Rep. Todd Porter, R-Mandan, pointed to a former coal plant in Wyoming that is being converted into a small nuclear facility as an example of competition from other states that are reusing spent nuclear fuel rods. 
Porter suggested that nuclear fuel rods at the nuclear power plant in Monticello, Minnesota, could be used in North Dakota, but he said the research needs to be done first. 
“Allow EERC to do the job that they’re supposed to be doing for the people of North Dakota … advancing the all-of-the-above energy portfolio that we asked them to do,” Porter said. 
The House also passed House Bill 1025 that calls for a legislative study of the potential for nuclear power plants in North Dakota. 
Rep. Jared Hendrix, R-Fargo, argued for waiting for results of the study before authorizing nuclear research.

Koleszar is running in the 5th District, which was redrawn for the 2026 elections after the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan ruled in 2023 that the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by drawing 13 state legislative boundaries predominantly on the basis of race.
No incumbent senators reside within the new district boundaries, which encompass Canton, Garden City, Inkster, Plymouth, Plymouth Township and Westland, Koleszar’s campaign said.
Koleszar is a former teacher and was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2019. He chaired the House Education Committee in 2023 and 2024 when Democrats held the majority.
“Teachers are some of the hardest working professionals I know, and every single day as an educator turned legislator, I have taken that work ethic to Lansing,” Koleszar said.
Under Michigan’s updated term-limit laws, Koleszar would be eligible to serve four more years in the Michigan Legislature – one full Senate term – once his current House term expires.
Among the signature achievements cited by Koleszar was his sponsorship of the state’s hands-free driving legislation, which was signed into law in 2023.

“O LORD, We Thy People unite in prayer for your servant, Donald John Trump, still battling eternal threats of Evil and Hate,” it says.
This bit of unseemly genuflection to one of the most un-Christ-like figures in American society hints at a truth about TABOR that, while long obscure, is now obvious: The state constitutional amendment and the MAGA movement come from the same place. Same political wellspring. Same scorched-earth style of policymaking. Same bad faith populist appeal to “freedom.” Same frothing contempt for government.
And, like MAGA, TABOR will continue to do damage until it’s extinguished.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
TABOR puts a cap on the annual revenue the state can collect and spend, and it mandates that the state refund to taxpayers any money it collects above the cap. It also says government entities must get voter approval to raise taxes. The insidious nature of the measure is that it can sound reasonable on the surface.
But the problems are legion.
TABOR undermines the very structure of state government by stripping elected representatives of one of their core responsibilities, sound management of the state budget. It turns much of that responsibility over to voters with the implied expectation that the electorate, according to some direct-democracy fantasy, should mark their ballots only after having pored over a 250-page budget, studied quarterly economic forecasts, weighed hundreds of competing state services, consulted public and private stakeholders, heard testimony from business groups and industry leaders, and accounted for local government interests. 
That’s what representatives are elected to do. 
Though TABOR purports to increase the cap at a regular population-growth-plus-inflation rate, the formula prevents revenue from keeping up with the economy. It forces the state to fall behind the cost of maintaining services and new investments. The point is to force government to wither.
The formula’s failure to keep up with state needs shows. Colorado has long ranked among the worst states for education funding, and it’s often unable to adequately support public health programs. TABOR has compromised the state’s business climate, and in moments of economic crisis it hobbles decision makers — the very people Colorado voters put in office to handle those crises. 
And TABOR, which no other state has adopted, might be unconstitutional. That’s the premise of a proposed state House joint resolution, which the House Finance Committee advanced this week. Resolution backers want a court to decide whether TABOR violates the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee that states have “a republican form of government,” in which the essential power to decide matters of “revenue and expenditure” remains with the legislature. 
Gutted government. Disdain for public services. TABOR accomplishes in the state much of what the Trump administration has set out to do at the federal level. But its kinship with the MAGA program runs much deeper than that.
Bruce successfully pitched TABOR to voters in 1992, during a period that swirled with whispers of what later became the voice of MAGA. This is when MAGA elder Newt Gingrich, then the Republican whip in the U.S. House and an originator of the Republican Party’s vicious style of attacks and insults, sent to GOP candidates a pamphlet that instructed them to use certain words to describe their opponents. “Disgrace,” “pathetic,” “sick,” “traitors” — words that Americans are now so accustomed to hearing from Trump, who in 1992 saw the Trump Plaza Hotel descend into bankruptcy.
Bruce “rebranded the idea of starving a government as a fight for freedom,” as NPR host Robert Smith once put it. It’s striking how closely that posture matches rhetoric around the government destruction project underway in Washington. 
“Smaller government is the only way to restore your freedom,” proclaimed Elon Musk in a social media post in February. Musk leads Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is tearing through federal agencies to impose funding reductions.
Bruce himself behaved in a Trumpian manner that threw rivals off balance. He once provoked then-Secretary of State Natalie Meyer to an outburst when he said in her presence, in front of news cameras, that she had “a mental deficiency.” Then-Gov. Roy Romer likened Bruce to a “terrorist” trying to destroy the state government.
In 2012, Bruce was prosecuted for tax evasion. Like Trump, he is a convicted felon. 
Bruce, however, was hardly the only TABOR campaigner whose true colors more recently were revealed to be shades of Trumpist orange. One of Bruce’s earliest prominent backers was John Andrews, a former state Senate president who is among the most influential Colorado conservatives of the past several decades. In 2016, Andrews emerged as one of the first top GOP figures in the state to throw support to Trump.
In his book about TABOR, former Colorado state Rep. Brad Young notes that the measure’s leading champion nationally was Barry Poulson, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Colorado. By 2020, Poulson had become a public supporter of Trump’s reelection campaign.
While TABOR remains the law in Colorado, the state’s political environment has changed dramatically since the amendment’s passage. Republicans dominated state politics into the early years of the new millennium, but then a shift left took hold, and today Democrats have settled into trifecta control of the Capitol.
The TABOR campaigners found a natural home in the Trump cult while the rest of the state adopted a fiercely anti-MAGA agenda. That opposition implicates TABOR itself.

But months before the new standards will be implemented in schools, the events are canceled due to federal funding cuts. Other summer programs for students and educators are suspended, including career exploration camps for middle schoolers that were expected to serve 600 students.
State Education Department officials did not say whether the suspended programs will be reinstated at a later date. Department spokeswoman Nancy Van Der Weide said the department will work to balance fiscal responsibility with “our equally important priority of providing South Dakota’s K-12 students with the best educational opportunities available.”
Public school advocates worry about lack of planning as Trump moves to close US Education Department

States and school districts can resubmit requests for the federal funding, which was provided as pandemic relief and then extended by the Biden administration. But the projects will be more strictly reevaluated by the Trump administration based on how they address the effects of COVID-19 on students, according to the federal Department of Education. The state has not told South Dakota Searchlight if the department plans to reapply.
East Dakota Educational Cooperative contracted with the state to organize the Civics and History Summit and History Road Trip. The state used federal funds to pay for the events each of the past two years, but the federal Department of Education canceled $2.8 million in funding to pay for this year’s events.
Sisseton School District Superintendent Tammy Meyer said students and teachers in her district have participated in the programs in the past.
“I’ve seen the excitement of staff to attend the summit and road trips to bring back those experiences and to teach their students what they’ve learned. I’ve seen the impact of these career summer camps on students,” Meyer said. “It’s unfortunate the staff and students who anticipated attending those may not have those opportunities this summer.”
Feds cut funding because extensions were ‘not justified’
As of April 7, Trump administration funding cuts affecting South Dakota’s state government totaled nearly $10 million. More than half of those cuts — over $5 million — have impacted the state Department of Education.
U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon notified state education departments in a March 28 letter that COVID-19 federal relief funds would expire that day, instead of in March 2026. The change impacts the final payouts of the American Rescue Plan Act’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund.
Congress approved $189.5 billion in ESSER funding during the pandemic to help schools recover from pandemic setbacks and expenses.

South Dakota was awarded $593.4 million, according to the federal pandemic oversight website. The funds were intended for the state department and individual school districts. The awards’ obligation deadline was set for the end of September 2024, but some entities, including the state department, requested extensions to spend remaining funds. Extensions were granted by the Biden administration, until they were recently revoked by the Trump administration.
McMahon said in the letter that an extension to spend remaining funds “was not justified.”
“Extending deadlines for COVID-related grants, which are in fact taxpayer funds, years after the COVID pandemic ended is not consistent with the Department’s priorities and thus not a worthwhile exercise of its discretion,” McMahon wrote.
Schools could spend the funds on programs and improvements to address student needs, including summer classes, extended programs, educational software, mental health services, indoor air quality improvements and building renovations. All projects were subject to approval by the state Education Department.
Three South Dakota school districts were impacted by the loss of extended funds. Sisseton lost $448,071, Iroquois lost $69,662, and Armour lost $9,061, according to the Bureau of Finance and Management. 
Sisseton was awarded a total of $11.7 million in ESSER funds over its three phases, using the money to renovate its high school building and classrooms, replace its roof, and purchase school buses and student laptops, among other programs and improvements, Meyer said. Some of its lost funding was due to unused funds, but about $319,000 was renovation spending that had yet to be reimbursed.
Meyer said she’s working with the state department to resubmit its extension request. Otherwise, the $319,000 will have to come out of the district’s own budget, which might cause a postponement other projects.
“It’s late in the budget year,” Meyer said, “so a lot of our projects have already been assigned and established for this budget.”
Beyond the history summit and road trip, another $2.37 million in extended funding would have supported middle school career summer camps, mentoring academies for teachers and a state website listing open teaching positions in the state. The Associated School Boards of South Dakota also hosts a website for educator openings.

According to the South Dakota Board of Regents, the Dakota Dreams summer career exploration camps served 1,800 middle school students between 2023 and 2024. Another 600 students were expected to attend camps this summer in nursing, health sciences, education, law enforcement, cyber operations, computer science, engineering and more.
The state’s teacher apprenticeship pathway, which allows paraprofessionals to earn a teaching degree for a reduced rate while working full time, lost $58,178 in federal funding. The state Jobs for America’s Graduates program, which helps struggling middle and high school students complete their education, lost $88,414. The state Department of Education hasn’t responded to questions about the fate of the two programs.
Social studies standards implications
The South Dakota Board of Education Standards approved social studies standards changes in 2023 after almost two years of controversy over their age appropriateness, feasibility and the scope of Native American history included.
Shortly after, then-Gov. Kristi Noem and South Dakota Department of Education Secretary Joe Graves said students “will be taught the best social studies education in the country” and be equipped “with the solid grounding in history and civics they need to exercise their role as citizens.”
“The department stands ready to support that implementation with professional development and standards-aligned resources,” Graves said at the time.

Rob Monson, executive director of School Administrators of South Dakota, said educators “were counting” on the professional development opportunities this summer.
“A lot of districts were looking forward to having conversations at the history summit and road trip locations to get clarity on the new standards,” Monson said. “It’s unfortunate for those who would attend and those who would benefit.”
The civics and history event cancellations won’t affect the social studies standards implementation this fall, Van Der Weide said.
“We’ve successfully hosted these programs within the past two years and continue to offer implementation support for our educators,” she said, adding that the department provides standards-aligned books and resources along with a weekly social studies curriculum to South Dakota classrooms.
Dismantled federal Education Department won’t negatively impact SD, secretary says
The funding cuts compound existing worries public school advocates have surrounding the uncertainty of education funding. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing McMahon to dismantle her department and “return education authority to the states.” The move followed a 50% reduction in department staff. 
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Graves said he doesn’t see the move to dismantle the federal Department of Education “negatively impacting South Dakota.”
“I think some people have had some real concerns about what’s going on at the federal level,” Graves said. “The truth is, I don’t see it having much of an impact or causing that much change for us other than returning decision-making to the state level where constitutionally,  pragmatically and ideally it would remain.”

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

The proposal, which is included in a sweeping health bill, aims to add “protections for families looking to place their loved one in a facility,” Republican state Rep. Tara Peters of Rolla, told lawmakers shortly before the House approved the bill last month. 
The Senate Committee on Families, Seniors and Health heard public testimony Wednesday.

The bill has won support from advocates for seniors as well as lobbyists representing associations for long-term care facilities.
The only opposition came from the referral companies themselves, who said the requirements were a regulatory burden that would confuse families trying to get information on facilities.
Washington, Colorado, Arizona, and Maryland have passed similar laws.
Companies such as the national, private-equity backed A Good Place for Mom offer free assistance for those looking for assisted living facilities. They make money by receiving fees from facilities for referrals. 
A Good Place for Mom, which is based in New York, hired seven Jefferson City lobbyists on March 4, according to the Missouri Ethics Commission. 
The legislation would require agencies to disclose any relationship between the company and long-term care facility, and the fact that the company receives a fee for the referral. It would also require the consumer to sign off on an agreement before the agency shares their contact info.
Proponents argue that consumers aren’t made aware of the companies’ motivations for recommending certain facilities. They also say that when consumers enter their contact information into a company’s website, they are not aware that they are giving permission to share that information with facilities.
Jeff Balleau, who testified in support of the legislation, runs a local referral agency and believes there should be more transparency. 
“The only people that don’t support this are billion dollar venture capitalist companies who feel like honesty and transparency doesn’t meet family needs,” he said. 
He added that when his father was searching for a facility, he got “40 calls in a day” and “I’m not sure who finds that helpful.” He said he’s seen clients have trouble opting out once they’re signed up and their information has been shared.
Erin Dwyer, who works at Senior Care Authority, another local referral company, as a senior care advisor said “these online lead aggregators don’t listen to client needs. They blast their client info, and the families need to be able to opt out.” 
A Washington Post investigation last year found that A Good Place for Mom, the largest such agency, regularly recommends facilities on its website that state regulatory agencies have found to be substandard. Reporters found more than one-third of facilities recognized by A Place for Mom from 2023 to 2024 as award-winning, across 28 states, were cited by the state for “serious violations affecting resident care.” The U.S. Senate’s Special Committee on Aging subsequently announced it was launching an investigation into A Place for Mom.

State Rep. Phil Amato, a Republican from Arnold, sponsored the standalone version of the bill that passed out of committee earlier this year unanimously for the second year in a row. It was later added to Peters’ health care bill as an amendment. 
Amato was inspired to file the bill after hearing from constituents, he told a House committee in March.
Amato said in one instance, the sibling of a potential long-term care resident entered her info to one of these sites. The woman, who’d recently lost her husband, then received a barrage of calls from facilities that appointments had been set up for her to visit. She didn’t even know if assisted living would be right for her yet.
“She’s grieving the loss of her husband, and now she’s getting all of these pestering phone calls,” Amato said. “…When it was told to me, I couldn’t believe it. And then since then, I’ve had other horror stories.”
Amato’s bill last year was nearing passage, he said in March, but died when the Senate adjourned early. 
“This year, there’s getting some pushback,” Amato said, “because there’s been some, I know you’re shocked to hear, but somebody has hired lobbyists to come and try to make sure that this thing is defeated.”
Michelle McGovern, the chief legal officer for A Place for Mom, testified that while her company supports transparency, the bill imposes an “unnecessary regulatory burden,” and will confuse families trying to access information.
“Forcing families into fee disclosures and business negotiations, especially during times of emotional stress will add confusion and not clarity to families,” she said. 
McGovern said the provision requiring families to sign off on an agreement with the company could prove confusing and negative to their business.
“We just want to keep the contracts between us and the community,” she said at the March hearing, referring to the facilities they contract with.
A Place for Mom contracts with 200 care facilities across Missouri, McGovern said.
State Rep. Jo Doll, a St. Louis Democrat, pressed McGovern at last month’s hearing.
“It’s kind of like you’re selling the information to your community customers,” Doll said.
McGovern responded that consumers are “consenting for us to share. I mean, there’s no other way to do a referral. They are consenting to us to share their information with the community.” 
Doll said people who provide their contact info may just want to see the options, not have their information shared with facilities.
Jewell Patek, a longtime Jefferson City lobbyist representing A Place for Mom and another referral company called Caring, said Wednesday the bill would hurt seniors.
“This bill would be very harmful to the business practices of the people who are providing the most information that’s free and available and trustworthy,” he said, “and I think it would be harmful to the folks that everyone’s saying they’re trying to protect.”
The committee concluded without taking a vote on the bill Wednesday.

[&#8230;]","Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo making remarks during his State of the State Address in the Assembly Chambers in Janaury, 2025. (Photo by Richard Bednarski for Nevada Current)Sounding more like Rodney Dangerfield than the chief executive of Nevada, Gov. Joe Lombardo complained last weekend to a Republican gathering that he’s getting no respect in the Democratically-controlled Nevada Legislature, which he says has left him impotent to chart a course for the state. 
“Unless you have that majority, you can’t make this difference. Can’t make a difference,” Lombardo lamented while addressing the crowd at the Republican Party’s annual Lincoln Day Dinner in Pahrump. 
The governor told the crowd he “had a discussion” with Majority Leader Nicole Canizzarro. “And I said, ‘Hey, what the hell is going on? My bills haven’t been heard. And the response was, ‘just because you’re the governor doesn’t mean you get a hearing.’” 
The speech was an illustration of Lombardo’s fleeting efforts at bipartisanship.
“As governor, I am filled with hope and optimism [in] what we can accomplish if we simply summon the will to work together,” Lombardo said in his inauguration address in 2023. “This is the central covenant of my administration.”
He went on to veto a record 75 bills. 
In January, during his State of the State speech, he urged state lawmakers to “set aside partisan politics.” 
But on Saturday, common ground was beyond the governor’s grasp as he maligned Democratic voters as well as elected officials.  
“I think it’s important for people to realize that the strategy associated with the Democratic Party is stay at home. ‘What can the government do to give handouts to us in order to ensure that we continue to support the government’ and re-elect people that represent them in that manner?”
The governor complained that he’s stifled by the Legislature’s Democratic majority. 
“People are freaking tired, and the Democratic Party has not seen the election results of November as a mandate,” he said. “They see it as an obstacle of what they’re trying to achieve.”
“Every day on social media, I get a submissive (sic) that says, ‘Why isn’t Governor Lombardo doing what Governor DeSantis is doing? Why isn’t Governor Lombardo doing what Governor Youngkin is doing? Why isn’t Governor Lombardo doing what Governor Abbott is doing?’ Because I don’t have that luxury of a majority of the Legislature that is of the Republican Party.”
Lombardo had a message for the “individuals on social media – that are talking bad about all of us, in particular me. And a little bit on [Lt. Gov.] Stavros Anthony,” he joked. “Who cares? Stavros said the line is ‘f**k you.’ He actually didn’t say that. I said that.” 
Lombardo suggested “those stupid protests that occur in the state capital” are paid for by the Democratic Party, adding momentum among Democrats “isn’t because they’re pissed because they want to make a difference, it’s because they’re being paid.” 
The governor observed that two months into the 120-day legislative session, only two bills have landed on his desk. “One is to pay for the Legislature, and two is whether they let chickens roam,” Lombardo said of legislation that, in light of high egg prices and scarcity resulting from bird flu, suspended the law for 120 days that  requires that egg-bearing hens have the ability to roam. 
Among Lombardo’s legislative priorities, he told the Republicans, is economic development, adding that “under the two years of my tenure as your governor, we have brought $5 billion in economic development into the state.” 
Yet, he observed, Nevada leads the nation in unemployment and job availability. 
“You know why? Because they’re not quality jobs,” he said. “People would rather manipulate the government process and receive unemployment or to sit at home versus occupying a job that’s available that doesn’t see their family moving forward.”
Lombardo announced he endorsed Nevada Republican Party chairman Michael McDonald for re-election. 
“Everybody complains about like, ‘Why is he still the chair? Why is he still the chair? One, he wants to do it, which is very important,” the governor said. “Two, he has the fire in his stomach to do it. And three is he’s made a difference.” 
McDonald, who like Lombardo, is a former Las Vegas Metro cop, was one of five fake electors who cast Nevada’s electoral votes in 2020 for Donald Trump.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/grim-lombardo-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-10 10:04:35.392817

Nevada Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford heard it, while he was in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday [&#8230;]","""WTF. Who's in charge?""
Rep. Steven Horsford asked U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer Wednesday. (House Ways and Means Committee screengrab) Did you hear the one about everybody worldwide, probably even the penguins on those islands, telling Trump they would do whatever Trump says because he’s the greatest tariff negotiator in the whole history of ever?
Nevada Democratic U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford heard it, while he was in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday in which Trump’s U.S. Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, was testifying.
And Horsford wasn’t buying it.
Asked by Horsford for details on Trump’s “pause” on the trade war against pretty much the entire world that Trump launched with much fanfare last week, Greer said “my understanding is that because so many countries decided not to retaliate…”
“Excuse me?” interjected an incredulous Horsford.
“China increased their tariffs on the United States. Trump blinked,” Horsford told Greer
Horsford could have added that the European Union Wednesday approved 25% tariffs on a host of U.S. goods aimed primarily at Republican states — not in response to Trump’s preposterously named “reciprocal” tariffs he announced on the also preposterously named “Liberation Day” last week, but in retaliation for 25% tariffs Trump slapped on EU steel and aluminum last month. (Thursday the EU announced it would pause implementation of those tariffs to see if the 78-year-old toddler gets a clue while in his self-imposed time out over the next 90 days, although the EU phrased it more diplomatically.)
Horsford might also have reminded Greer that rather than trembling in terror at Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, the EU had been crafting retaliatory tariffs to those, too, through joint consultation between not only member nations but also potentially affected industries, in a methodical and thoughtful process of the sort unthinkable under the Trump-Musk freak show.
And Hosford could have even noted that Canada Wednesday announced 25% tariffs on U.S. autos and parts exports, matching Trump’s 25% tariffs on Canada autos and parts that went into effect last week. 
Who’s reciprocal now?
While Horsford was pressing Greer for details on what Trump’s tariff policy is now and how and when the determination to pause the big beautiful tariffs Trump announced last week was made, it became obvious that Greer — Trump’s top trade negotiator — only learned about it when a staffer whispered it into his ear during the Ways and Means hearing.
“WTF? Who’s in charge?” Horsford exclaimed, adding that Trump had “pulled the rug out from under” Greer and Horsford would feel sorry for him, except he doesn’t.
“There’s no strategy. You just found out, three seconds ago, sitting here. We saw you,” Horsford added.
“What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy?” Horsford continued. “How are you in charge of negotiations if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?”
At one point Wednesday Horsford referred to Trump administration tariff policy as “amateur hour.” He’s right. Trump’s tariff policy isn’t the product of some brilliant and carefully calibrated strategy. It’s dictated by Trump’s erratic temperament and crackpot obsessions.
But that’s no reason to ignore Trump’s venal side. And Horsford didn’t.
Before Trump tweeted his tariff policy, he took to social media to tell everyone “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!”
When he posted that, did Trump already know that within hours he would make an announcement that was sure to prompt the markets to rebound, and the social media post was a signal for those in the know? Did Trump by some other means tip off people prior to his announcement, thus allowing them to score a substantial financial windfall yesterday?
Or as Horsford put it to Greer, “Is this market manipulation?” 
“No,” Greer responded.
“Why not?” Horsford asked. “If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?”
“It’s not market manipulation,” Greer responded.
“So if it’s not market manipulation, what is it?” Horsford asked again. “Who’s benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?”
Whatever else it was, “it sure is not a strategy,” Horsford added.
It’s hard to imagine some billionaire or three didn’t make a killing yesterday because Trump, wittingly or not, spilled the beans early. Trump and his courtiers are nothing if not messy.
Alas, even if Wednesday was a day of historic-folkloric insider trading, Oval Office style, the U.S. Supreme Court has decreed that laws are for mere mortals, not Trump.
Meanwhile, Trump wants everyone to believe he perfectly executed his “Liberation Day” tariffs and the world surrendered to his invincible Trumpness, and it was all part of his brilliant plan.
But Horsford’s right. Trump didn’t “pause” his tariffs because the world bowed down before him. Faced with markets crumbling because of him, nations standing up to him, and even some congressional Republicans publicly (gasp!) questioning his greatness, Trump lost his nerve, and blinked.
By the time the markets opened Thursday morning, Wednesday’s rebound, which fell far short of recouping losses since Trump’s Rose Garden “reciprocal” tariff tantrum last week, was already in retreat.
And whether it’s in 90 days, or 30 days, or every ten days, Trump’s aforementioned erratic temperament, combined with Republican congressional cowardice, guarantees a lot more episodes just as nerve-wracking and destructive as the fiasco Trump foisted on us with his asinine “Liberation Day.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-9-25-at-8.27-PM-1024x579.jpeg,,,2025-04-10 10:04:35.392817

Elissa Slotkin has condemned the detention of a Dearborn attorney by federal agents as he returned from a vacation with his family, calling it an attack on the legal profession by the Trump administration.
Amir Makled was detained by customs agents at Detroit Metro Airport on Sunday as he and his family returned from a trip to the Dominican Republic.
“When coming into the airport, I was screened and flagged when a Customs and Border Protection agent requested that they need a TTRT agent, Terrorism Task Force Response Team, to be summoned to the scene,” said Makled in a video posted to TikTok. “I said, ‘Oh, crap. Here we go.’”
Makled said he was subjected to prolonged questioning, during which agents demanded he surrender access to his phone despite not having a warrant and refusing to specify what it was they were looking for. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This kind of intrusive border search, untethered from individualized suspicion, not only raises serious constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth Amendments, but also risks chilling protected speech and association,” Makled said in a statement released by the Detroit & Michigan chapter of the National Lawyers Guild.
But an official with Customs and Border Protection said Makled was referred for secondary inspection, which she called “a routine, lawful process” that can apply for any traveler. 
The guild noted that Makled currently represents Sammie Lewis, a pro-Palestinian demonstrator who was of seven individuals charged by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel with misdemeanor trespassing and an additional count of resisting or obstructing a police officer, a felony that carries a penalty of 2 years in prison, after officers cleared out a protest encampment from the University of Michigan campus.
“Attorneys, regardless of whom they represent, must not be subject to intimidation tactics by the government,” the guild said. “This incident is a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to deter attorneys from representing clients in politically sensitive cases.”
In response to the incident, Slotkin (D-Holly) also denounced Makled’s detention.
“You can’t just detain the people you don’t agree with. That’s not how our democracy works. Everyone in our country has a fundamental right to representation in court, and this Administration is attacking lawyers and the legal profession for simply doing their job,” Slotkin said in a Facebook post.
After about 90 minutes, Makled was released, but not before letting agents see his phone’s contact list. However, he said he refused to surrender access to the phone itself as it contained privileged attorney/client information.
“The lawyer has a fiduciary duty to protect the secrets of their client. Border patrol agents, Customs and Border Protection, the law allows them to seize our phones at the border crossing. They do have the right to take your phone. They do not, however, have the right to go through your phone without consent unless they have a search warrant,” Makled said.
Makled’s detention follows a March 22 presidential memo issued by President Donald Trump directing the U.S. Justice Department to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.”
“It is because I took a position in the protester cases that I have been targeted. It is because I choose to stand firm on the beliefs that we should all have the right to speech, the right to protest, and the right to say no,” Makled said.
Customs and Border Protection Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Hilton Beckham posted to social media Wednesday and called Makled’s accusations “blatantly false and sensationalized.”
Beckham said officers worked to ensure Makled’s attorney-client privilege was respected and that all actions were conducted in accordance with established protocols. 
“Claims that this was an attack on his profession or were politically motivated are baseless. Our officers are following the law, not agendas,” Beckham said.
However, the National Lawyers Guild disputed that characterization.
“We decry the use of law enforcement agencies to attempt to chill dissent and undermine the rights of our members, attorneys, and their clients. We applaud Mr. Makled for safeguarding client information as well as his personal data from government intrusion and intimidation, and demand an end to these tactics from all parts of the government,” the guild said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-886265002.jpg,,,2025-04-10 10:04:35.392817

But that money has been cut off.","In March, President Trump signed an executive order requiring the elimination of seven federal agencies he labeled “unnecessary.” Among these was the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).
The IMLS has been a significant source of federal funding for museums and libraries, providing millions of dollars in grants since 1996.
Among them are grants to Connecticut’s statewide library services — including early literacy resources and programs, summer reading support, digital skills and job training.
In 2024, the federal government gave Connecticut a little over $2 million, which was intended to last until Sept. 30. But earlier this month, Connecticut — along with Washington and California — had its federal funding cut off mid-year.
Scott Jarzombek, the president of the Connecticut Library Association, said that deciding to attack libraries is like declaring war on democracy.
“Free flow of information is how you keep democracy alive,” he said. “So defunding libraries, at any level, is really just saying that you don’t value democracy, that you don’t value free-flowing information, and that you don’t want to benefit people who maybe lack the resources that you have. There’s a total lack of empathy here, which completely blows me away.”
Jarzombek said libraries and their services are fundamental for cities and towns.
“There is always a segment of a population that believes libraries aren’t necessary,” he said. “They tend to be vocal, but they tend to be few. If anyone looks at our numbers, the amount of visits that we get. The amount of programs that we do, the kind of programs that we do, from helping people get their taxes filed to helping people learn digital literacy skills. If people really paid attention, they would get why libraries are necessary.”
Connecticut State Library director Dawn LaValle said the grants also help pay the salaries at her organization, which benefits libraries across the state.
“We provide services to 509 schools, 210 public libraries and academic libraries,” she said. “And we do this all with $2.1 million, which, in the bigger picture of a state budget, is a drop in the bucket.”
Now the question is: Would the state be able to replace the money from the federal grant that’s been cut?
LaValle is not sure.
“Our state librarian, Deborah Schander, has been working very closely with state and state government officials as to the possible impact of this federal funding cut,” she said. “So, you know, we are working with our state agencies to make them aware of this situation. It’s incumbent upon that decision-making process.”
Public libraries are funded by cities or towns and are not directly supported by federal funds. However, librarians say their communities would still feel the impact of losing these services.
“There’s anxiety in the state, in libraries,” said Hamden Public Library director Melissa Canham-Clyne. “And we’re a small state. We have a lot of public libraries in the state, 169 municipalities, 171 public libraries, and each library has a mission to serve its public.”
She said libraries are more than just book repositories. They provide many services that most people take for granted.
“So a lot of people who don’t have to think about it just assume that everybody can get on their smartphone and do whatever they need to do on their smartphone, or that they have the internet at home, or they can get the internet or whatever,” she said. “And that’s just not the reality. There are a lot of people who don’t have access to the internet in their homes. There are a lot of people who have a smartphone who want to do things that are actually very difficult to do on a smartphone. Like applying for a job, applying for benefits from the state, and even doing banking things that a lot of us — and I’m going to speak for myself as a middle-class person — take for granted, and we just assume that other people might be able to do it. But when you take a deep dive, they can’t.”
She said they’ve given away laptops or tablets to people who did not have them.
“And when people say, ‘what do you mean a library? A library is giving things away?’ Well, we realized that to get somebody as an act, to become an active citizen, a digital citizen, you need to give them the device that’s going to allow them to do it.”
And without federal funding, she said, all these services are doomed to go away.
“I find myself becoming very protective and fierce regarding ensuring that the freedom to read, learn, create, and think is being called un-American or unpatriotic,” she said. “Americans value their ingenuity and the belief that one can transcend their individual challenges. Public libraries are here to help any person live those values. It is wearisome, but I think of a quote from the second president of this country: ‘There are two kinds of people. Those who make commitments and those who keep them.’ Libraries have always been and always will be committed.”
Earlier this month, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong joined a coalition of 20 state attorneys general who are suing the Trump administration. They want to stop the administration’s plan to reduce or eliminate three federal agencies that help support libraries, museums, workers, and minority-owned businesses.

Under state law, only American citizens may vote in Alaska.
Those 10 new cases follow an 11th, opened in 2023, that has caused a legal debate in the Alaska Court of Appeals about whether someone must have the intent to deceive elections officials in order to be convicted for elections misconduct after incorrectly registering to vote.
That first case involves a Whittier resident named Tupe Smith who ran for a local school board seat and won, only to be prosecuted after elections officials learned that she was born in American Samoa and was not a U.S. citizen. American Samoa is the only U.S. territory whose residents Congress has not recognized as having birthright U.S. citizenship.
“These are actually the first criminal prosecutions that we’re aware of, based simply upon the fact that someone was born in American Samoa,” said attorney Neil Weare of Right to Democracy, a national group that is defending Smith in court.
“Had any of these individuals been born in Alaska, or Guam or Hawaii, Alaska would not be prosecuting them,” he said.
Smith’s attorney sought to have her case dismissed in 2024, on the grounds that Smith didn’t intend to deceive officials and believed that as an American national, she had the ability to run for office and vote in local elections.
A lower-court judge ruled partially in Smith’s favor, and her attorneys sought an interlocutory appeal, asking the Alaska Court of Appeals to rule on the issue before her case is finished.
Typically, the appeals court asks appellants to wait until their case is finished, but in this instance, it accepted the appeal. Oral arguments are expected later this year.
Weare said he believes Smith’s case and the new cases have a great deal in common.
According to the affidavits accompanying the new charging documents, the Division of Elections “received an anonymous complaint that alleged that ‘a large family group, many of whom were not U.S. Citizens,’ had also registered to vote and had voted in a recent election.”
That complaint came from someone who was familiar with the Smith case and the investigation that led to charges against her.
The division forwarded the new complaint to the Alaska Bureau of Investigation, a part of the Alaska State Troopers. 
The troopers investigated and visited Whittier in September “to interview … individuals who had registered to vote and had voted in a recent prior election but who were either not U.S. Citizens or whose citizenship status was unclear.”
Preliminary court dates have been set for the 10 accused people, who face a variety of felony and misdemeanor charges. 
“Everyone who is eligible to vote and properly registered to vote is encouraged to vote. Voting is a right of citizenship. It is how our leaders are selected and how everyday citizens get to influence policy on a local, state, and national level. To be clear, you must be a citizen to vote in Alaska in any election — federal, state, or local,” said Alaska Deputy Attorney General John Skidmore, in a statement announcing the charges against the 10 people.
Since President Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, Republican politicians — including Trump himself — have claimed that fraud caused Trump’s loss.
In Alaska and elsewhere, no evidence has been found to uphold that idea.
The 10 charges filed last week more than double the total number of voter-fraud-related cases related to Alaska since the 2020 election.
Even these new cases, Weare argues, are on shaky legal ground.
A U.S. District Court judge ruled in favor of American Samoans seeking recognition of citizenship in a case that was later overruled by an appeals court in 2021. But in a separate case, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch has questioned the soundness of a legal precedent that helped underpin the appellate ruling.
Weare said he intends to argue that under the 14th Amendment, people who are born in American Samoa have a right to U.S. citizenship.
“The Constitution guarantees them that right,” he said. “So that’s a question that will come out over the course of this case: Can the state of Alaska, in fact, prove that these people born on U.S. soil, who owe permanent allegiance to the United States, who have a U.S. passport, are not U.S. citizens? And we don’t think they’ll be able to do that.”

A year later, the City Council rewrote the ordinance, exempting new buildings for the first 20 years and allowing landlords to raise rents [&#8230;]","An apartment building under construction in St. Paul in February 2020. Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. In St. Paul, a debate has been brewing about whether the city should update its rent stabilization policies. 
The city first implemented a strict rent stabilization policy after a 2021 ballot initiative. A year later, the City Council rewrote the ordinance, exempting new buildings for the first 20 years and allowing landlords to raise rents by more than the 3% limit after a tenant leaves.
After seeing a large decline in housing production — rent in St. Paul has actually grown slightly faster than in Minneapolis since 2021 — the mayor and some councilmembers are looking to rewrite the ordinance by exempting all buildings built after 2005. 
Although the explanations behind St. Paul’s current economic development struggles are multiple, this is a step in the right direction for the city.
There’s no denying St. Paul’s development downturn over the past few years. Housing markets are complex systems, and this slowdown has multiple causes. Though opinions may vary on which is the biggest factor, there is broad consensus that high interest rates, high construction costs, and rent stabilization are all major contributors to our housing production slowdown. 
Interest rates are elevated, raising the borrowing costs for developers. COVID-related supply chain shocks led to two years of rapidly rising construction costs. As I’ve recently argued elsewhere, low rent growth in Minneapolis and St. Paul — which is in many ways a positive outcome — has likely also reduced development in the Twin Cities, because developers want to build in markets with rising rents. 
Although construction has slowed throughout the Twin Cities metro recently, the municipal and county-level permitting numbers tell a more complicated story. Consider the figure below, which shows multifamily housing permits — specifically, buildings with 5 or more units — in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and the rest of Hennepin and Ramsey Counties.

Although development has cooled off from a hot post-COVID period everywhere, development in St. Paul fell faster and earlier than its neighbors, starting just before rent stabilization was passed. Only in 2023 did Minneapolis’s development really start to slow. 
St. Paul City Council candidate Cole Hanson has argued that homelessness and public health challenges are the primary factor discouraging local housing development, citing problems near Allianz Field, where new development has stalled.  No doubt, these are important barriers to development, and Hanson is right to focus on humanely assisting St. Paulites forced to sleep on our streets. 
But can this really explain why housing development has slowed down so much across the city, with developments struggling in Highland Bridge and the West Seventh neighborhood? 
Hanson also pointed to zoning and permitting. There’s no doubt that St. Paul could stand to further improve its zoning laws to encourage more housing and streamline administrative processes for new development. However, this can’t explain why there has been a particular slowdown in development recently — especially considering that St. Paul’s zoning and land use policies have become increasingly supportive of new housing in recent years, as the city has legalized fourplexes citywide and eliminated minimum parking requirements (I recently covered some anecdotal cases of new development responding to these reforms). 
Still, for the sake of argument, let’s say St. Paul is burdened by red tape and that developers are passing on St. Paul and hopping over to Bloomington or Minneapolis to build more easily. If you buy that argument, then surely rent stabilization is also disadvantaging St. Paul relative to its neighbors, none of whom have rent stabilization. 
The world is messy, and we will likely never have a study that can precisely isolate the impacts of St. Paul’s series of rent stabilization policies. But a consideration of various factors suggests that rent stabilization — particularly in its strongest form — has meaningfully contributed to St. Paul’s decline in housing development. 
A corollary of all this complexity is that making a modest change to rent stabilization will hardly transform the near-term state of housing development. Indeed, it’s likely that there will continue to be some development disappointments even if the city permanently exempts new housing from rent stabilization.
By their very nature, however, macroeconomic conditions are not forever — while local policymakers cannot change interest rates themselves, they can count on interest rates to change eventually. 
St. Paul seemed to miss out on much of the last housing development boom. When interest rates eventually fall and developers start building again, will St. Paul miss out again?
Fundamentally, cities must balance multiple precarious and often-contradictory goals. These include providing renters with stability, increasing the supply of subsidized affordable housing, building more overall housing supply to keep market pressures in check, and growing the city’s tax base to support city services. 
That’s a tough challenge for any city, and it’s especially tough for a place like St. Paul as it reels from a host of challenges in recent years. While it’s possible for a well-designed rent stabilization policy to be a part of this mix, the current policy has almost certainly certainly depressed development and tax revenue. 
Proposed reforms of the policy will hardly fix all of St. Paul’s challenges, but it’s a worthwhile first step.

For some people, the high-pitched drilling, bright fluorescent lights and uncomfortable poking and prodding can make visiting the dentist’s office daunting. But for people with special needs who are often hypersensitive to sounds, lights and touch, it can be especially tough.
As CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang explains, dental offices that can accommodate patients with autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome or even Alzheimer’s are few and far between in California.
Patients with special needs often have to be sedated for routine exams or require more time to become desensitized. Those with physical disabilities may need specialized equipment, such as wheelchair lifts. For complex procedures, Medi-Cal insurance from disabled patients typically doesn’t pay very well, further limiting patient access to private dentists.
Many of these patients are put on waiting lists or must drive hours to the nearest clinic that will take them — making them one of the most underserved populations in the state for dental care, according to the California Dental Association.
To help improve dental care for people with developmental disabilities and other special needs, the state has issued its latest round of specialty dental clinic grants in February totaling $47.2 million to 13 dentists and clinics.
One recipient is Dr. Maxmillian Chambers, an Imperial County dentist, who received a $5 million grant to open a dental surgical center for special needs patients. The grant will cover construction costs for eight chairs and two surgical theaters. Chambers said when the clinic opens, it will be able to serve about 2,100 people a year and will likely treat patients traveling from Arizona and Mexicali. 

Chambers: “I want to make a difference. I don’t want them to have to wait two to three years to see a dentist by which time everything has changed and deteriorated.”

Trump targets CA climate change policies

On Tuesday President Donald Trump issued an executive order that targets state and local climate change policies — singling out California’s key cap-and-trade program in the process, reports CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo.
Trump’s order directs the U.S. Attorney General to review and identify state and local acts that may be unconstitutional or preempted by federal law. The attorney general has 60 days to report back to Trump with findings and recommendations for action.
In addition to New York and Vermont, the order calls out California for “enacting burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.” Namely, the state’s program that aims to curb greenhouse gas emissions by allowing companies to buy and sell emissions credits.

The order: “California … punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to ‘trade’ carbon credits to meet California’s radical requirements.”

Some legal experts, however, cast doubt over Trump’s claims that states are overreaching their authority or that their policies are unconstitutional.
Californians’ power bills are lower than usual this month thanks to a twice-per-year climate credit funded by cap and trade. The amount of the credit depends on the utility, but most people will get a credit between $56 and $81.38.

Opening the door for AI-powered nuclear plants?

As state lawmakers and tech companies look to nuclear power as a potential energy source for artificial intelligence, California’s last remaining nuclear power plant is looking to artificial intelligence to help manage its own work, writes Alex Shultz for CalMatters. 
Last year Pacific Gas & Electric said they had a deal with AI startup Atomic Canyon to carry out “the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. nuclear power plant” for Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obisbo. The AI data-mining tool, known as Neutron Enterprise, helps workers go through millions of pages of technical reports, regulations and documents from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Maureen Zawalick, PG&E vice president of Business and Technical Services: “We probably spend about 15,000 hours a year searching through our multiple databases and records and procedures. And that’s going to shrink that time way down.”

Though Zawalick clarifies that Neutron Enterprise is not a “decision-maker,” it nonetheless paves the way for future uses of AI at Diablo Canyon and other facilities. 
California lawmakers have tried, with varying success, to pass measures regulating AI, and Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a San Luis Obisbo Democrat, said she has “many unanswered questions of the safety, oversight, and job implications for using AI at Diablo.”
At the federal level, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been looking into deploying AI tools at nuclear plants for a few years, but it’s unclear how those efforts will continue under the Trump administration, which opposes AI regulation.

This researcher’s project joins at least 30 others across the University of California system that have been terminated by the National Institutes of Health. Those multi-year awards were worth more than $173 million.


A California neurologist who’s among the nation’s top researchers on dementia has been swept up in President Donald Trump’s purging of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, adding to the growing cadre of research science terminated because of the administration’s edicts. 
In this case, the National Institutes of Health sent Dr. Charles DeCarli of UC Davis a letter in late March telling him that his nearly $36 million research project was being canceled on the grounds that it perpetuated a “DEI” agenda. With that notification, gone are about $10 million in remaining money for a project that included 28 clinical and research sites across the country and 1,700 participants with mild cognitive impairments.“We don’t have the ability to predict who’s going to get worse because we won’t be able to see them,” said DeCarli, who’s also co-director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at UC Davis. His project, with multiple collaborators, also had the goal of placing these participants in treatment and prevention trials.His project joins at least 30 others across the University of California system that have been terminated by the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, since Trump took office. Those multi-year awards were worth more than $173 million, according to a federal tracker, and so far the federal government has frozen almost $38 million in existing grant dollars, based on a CalMatters review. Other UC grants that have been terminated include research on developing a coronavirus vaccine, studying HIV prevention and assessing how racial discrimination affects the health of older gay men.

Sue or hold back? The University of California does both as it faces Trump’s wrath 

by Mikhail Zinshteyn 





The UC’s 10 campuses receive more than $2 billion in research funding from the agency and account for nearly a tenth of all academic research in the country.
Two weeks ago, the list of canceled National Institutes of Health grants across the country was 14 pages long. Since then, it’s swelled to 51 pages. Nationally, more than 700 grants have been canceled.There’s an irony to DeCarli’s work getting ensnared in the federal culling: The National Institutes of Health awarded him the six-year grant in 2020 when Trump was serving his first term in office. In its call for applications, the federal agency specifically required that projects reflect the “gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the United States.” The request for applications also asked that proposals reflect economic and geographic diversity, including people living in rural areas.Those were all research parameters in DeCarli’s project. Both Black and Hispanic Americans are one and a half times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s or dementia as white Americans. More women than men suffer from it, too.In its termination letter, the agency told DeCarli that “research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”DeCarli said the point of the project was to treat all Americans suffering from dementia. “I’m trying to take care of people, and just because they have different colors of their skin, should not in any way affect what I’m trying to do,” DeCarli said.About 5 million Americans suffer from dementia, which is a loss in the ability to think, remember and reason. Advanced dementia means a person is reliant on others for basic tasks, such as eating and bathing. Dementia is more common among older Americans, but it’s not a normal part of aging. 
While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, there are others. DeCarli’s project focused on the role vascular health plays in causing dementia. By treating vascular disease, such as injury to blood vessels in the brain, “you might be able to tolerate Alzheimer’s disease and never become demented,” he said. On the flipside, a patient may have their Alzheimer’s treated but won’t get better, because the patient’s vascular problems weren’t treated. 
Without federal funding, he says his research cannot continue. 
Lawsuits over NIH grants
The grant cancellations have triggered multiple lawsuits. California joined 15 other states whose attorneys general sued the National Institutes of Health last week in a Massachusetts federal court to reverse the project cancellations. The states argue that the grant terminations didn’t follow established federal law for how programs should be canceled and violated the U.S. Constitution. The UC filed a declaration in support of the California attorney general’s motion for a temporary restraining order.
“California universities have begun curtailing biomedical research and delaying the hiring of new staff and students who depend on NIH funding,” California’s attorney general’s office said in announcing the lawsuit Friday.

The lawsuit also alleges that the grant terminations may result in fewer doctoral students in the sciences because universities have less research money to support their education. The UC system is diverting money from other operations, like maintaining their buildings, to pay the salaries of affected graduate students, the multi-state suit says. The National Institutes of Health also terminated at least 17 grants at California State University campuses, the suit said.The American Civil Liberties Union also filed a lawsuit last week, alleging that the federal agency and its parent department — Health and Human Services — was illegally conducting an “ongoing ideological purge” by targeting grants it perceived as focused on DEI and gender. 
The UC and California separately filed suits challenging another decision by the agency to cap how much “indirect” grant funding institutions can use to support general research costs, such as building and maintaining labs and paying the people who run them.
The National Institutes of Health’s order to limit those indirect costs to 15% of a grant would reduce funding to the UC by at least $460 million and California campuses overall by about $860 million annually, according to an analysis by The Chronicle of Higher Education. Nationally, the university average for indirect costs is about 27%, though at some campuses it’s over 50%.A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled last week that the agency must rescind its 15% policy but an appeal is likely.The loss of federal research funding, plus a proposed cut of hundreds of millions of dollars in the state budget, prompted the UC to freeze hiring in late March.
Dementia researcher appeals decision
DeCarli and UC Davis are appealing to the NIH its decision to terminate his grant. He shared with CalMatters portions of his appeal that seeks to refute the agency’s assertion that his grant “does not effectuate NIH priorities” — a phrase included in letters to other researchers whose grants were terminated.For example, the 2011 National Alzheimer’s Project Act approved by Congress established several national research goals, including “action to promote healthy aging and reduce risk factors for Alzheimer’s and related dementias” and “prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer’s and related dementias.” DeCarli’s appeal argues that his research project meets those directives. His study is “developing a risk profile for vascular influences on cognition.” His work is also finding individuals who are at risk for dementia and creating a method for early diagnosis.The appeal also cites Trump’s own policy of “Make America Healthy Again,” which seeks to “drastically” lower chronic disease rates. DeCarli writes that “vascular risk factors, stroke and dementia are all chronic diseases common to older adults.”If the funds aren’t restored, he said “some staff layoffs are inevitable.” How many is unclear, but union contract rules say he’ll need to give notice in about 40 days; the affected staff would lose their jobs 60 days later.There’s a personally demoralizing element here, too. “This particular grant was the pinnacle of my research,” DeCarli said. He wrote one of the seminal papers on vascular cognitive impairment in 1995 and has been working on the subject ever since. He was a staff researcher at the National Institutes of Health for almost a decade before entering academia.Earning an award from the National Institutes of Health is highly competitive — only about 20% percent of applications are funded, or about 11,000 awards annually. It’s a grueling process for an already elite subgroup of specially trained researchers.
Research already affected
Even if the funding is restored through an appeal, DeCarli’s project has been compromised. His team is short 500 participants; the study needs a minimum number of participants from different regions and backgrounds to draw key conclusions about the role of vascular complications in dementia.With the grant funds frozen, the continuous work of evaluating the current 1,700 participants through MRI imaging and blood work also ceases. Though the grant was canceled for including diversity — again, a requirement of the initial grant application — the research project explores other factors about a person’s background, such as education levels and geographic location. “It turns out, if you live in the South in a place called the Stroke Belt, you’re at higher risk for vascular disease. We don’t understand why,” DeCarli said.
“Dementia affects many Americans and their loved ones,” he said. “It is an epidemic. It is a huge public health problem. This study addresses one aspect of that, and is trying to improve the health of all Americans.”

(Photo by Ronda Churchill for Nevada Current)Nevada state lawmakers are once again considering tracking and limiting the purchasing power of cash-rich corporate investors, which many believe are inflating the housing market and pricing out middle-class families.
“There are actual families who do want the American Dream,” said Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting Wednesday. “They want to take their pharmacy job, they want to take their teaching job, and they want to translate that money into a mortgage. They want to own a home, and they’re not actually able to do that in this current market.”
Neal believes the Legislature could help families like that by establishing a corporate landlord registry and restricting the number of single-family housing units that can be purchased by corporate investors. She is proposing both in Senate Bill 391, which passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
SB391 mirrors a 2023 bill Neal sponsored that was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, with one notable difference: The vetoed bill would have limited corporate purchases to 1,000 units a year. This year’s bill would limit corporate ownership to 100 a year.
To explain that change, Neal recalled that,  shortly after the last legislative session ended, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that corporate investors purchased 264 homes in a single day for $98 million.
“I was like, I really need to drop this number because it’s amazing that someone in one day could buy 265 homes and not bat an eye,” she said.
Neal said she believes the state has the power to temporarily cap corporate investors during a housing crisis.
The Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas has estimated that investors own roughly 15% of homes in the City of Las Vegas. That percentage is expected to grow both in Nevada and across the country.
The full extent of corporate ownership of single-family homes in Nevada is unknown. Companies often have multiple LLCs with nondescript names. The registry component of SB391 would provide more transparency, said Neal.
State Sen. Ira Hansen, the only Republican to vote for Neal’s bill in 2023, is again supporting the proposal.
“If Senator Ellison and Senator Hansen and Senator Krasner all want to  buy the same house, we bid against each other” around market value, he said. “But what if you’re bidding against somebody who can … very comfortably very easily push it to a million dollars and win the bid? That’s what’s happening in these markets.”
Hansen said Neal and the bill are up against “corporations that have literally unlimited resources to hire lobbyists and influence legislators.”
“All the policy people are going to be like ‘we can’t interfere with the free market,’” he said. “This isn’t the free market. This is an artificially manipulated market.”
Closing a tax loophole
Making each rental property its own LLC is often is a way to protect owners from legal liability. 
And, for large corporations with thousands of properties, the practice could also be shielding them from paying Nevada’s commerce tax.
Democratic Assemblymember Venicia Considine’s Assembly Bill 457 wants to close that loophole. The bill proposes that if there is a controlling owner whose LLCs combined would meet the state’s threshold for paying the commerce tax, then those LLCs must be aggregated into what’s known as a “combined taxpayer group” that is subject to the tax.
Businesses with gross revenue exceeding $4 million in a taxable year are subject to Nevada’s commerce tax. Only revenue above the $4 million threshold is taxed.
The concept of aggregating business entities that have the same controlling owner for tax purposes exists in other states, including Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as at the federal level.
AB457 requires approval by two-thirds of both legislative houses because it would potentially raise state revenue. But Considine and Legislative Counsel Bureau staff acknowledged in the bill’s Assembly Revenue Committee hearing Tuesday that they have no estimate of how much it would bring in.
The assemblymember framed the proposal as being driven less by revenue and more by tax fairness..
“As businesses they should be paying the commerce taxes that other businesses that meet the commerce tax are paying,” she said.
It’s a cause Considine has taken up before. In 2023 she sponsored a bill to remove an existing exemption in the state commerce tax for real estate investment trusts, REITs. That bill passed the full Assembly and a Senate committee but was not given a vote by the full Senate.
Considine said that in 2019 three entities, which owned a combined 8,000 homes, were known as the landlords with the highest number of maintenance issues and evictions. She referenced studies that have found a correlation between how far away landlords are and how many units they have and “community-level issues” like maintenance problems.
Hedge funds, private equity firms and other corporate investors are commodifying the housing market, she added. “They are buying in bulk without investing in communities.”
The Assembly Revenue Committee took no action on AB457. The bill is exempt from standard deadlines, meaning lawmakers have additional time to move it through the Legislature.
A third proposal
Democratic state Sen. Edgar Flores introduced a third proposal to limit the purchasing power of corporate investors.
Senate Bill 242 would prohibit investment companies from purchasing residential properties unless they have been listed on the market for at least 30 days.
The bill, which was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee in late February, has not been given a hearing.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ronda-housing-aerial-cropped-Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-2-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-04-10 09:10:09.221953

""Street pricing"" policies offer a solution, argues a former college baseball player.","Guest Commentary written by

Alex Jacquez
Alex Jacquez is the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative and a former college baseball player.


In 1978, the San Francisco Giants announced a nickel price increase on hot dogs and beer, bringing prices to 80 cents and 90 cents, respectively, to pay for new concession equipment. 
One fan, Ron Gordon, took umbrage. He calculated that the price increase would deliver a windfall for concessionaires well above the cost of the new equipment, and embarked on a nationwide campaign to fight the hike. He succeeded. The Giants rolled back the price increase on hot dogs, and President Jimmy Carter’s chief inflation advisor wrote him a letter hailing his efforts as heroic. 
While I can’t claim to be a modern-day Ron Gordon, my background compels me to take on a similar fight against ever-increasing concession prices. 
I played Division 1 college baseball until my career ended because of an injury. I still love the game, but our national pastime, like other major professional sports, is big business. The league brought in $12.1 billion in revenue last year, and the top five professional sports leagues in North America brought in nearly $60 billion combined. 
While team valuations climb ever higher, and billionaire team owners get richer, it has become increasingly unaffordable for a family. All in all, a family of four can expect to spend an average of $240 for tickets, concessions and parking at a Major League Baseball game. An NFL game will set them back a whopping $631. Those costs are out of reach for many fans, and if younger ones aren’t exposed to the game early, they may never develop the love that I did. 
We need to change things. These days, sports stadiums are nearly always backed by taxpayer funding at the local, state and federal level, meaning fans are footing the bill on both ends. These deals promise economic development and community benefits that too often fail to materialize. But we can stop publicly funded venues from ripping off families and future fans, who are often barred from bringing their own food and drink in for an affordable snack. 
Policymakers should institute “street pricing” for venues that are funded by taxpayer dollars. This means that vendors can only charge prices that are comparable to the same items outside the stadium. 
Nearly 80% of airports (also heavily funded by public dollars) are covered by some form of “street pricing plus.” But as the infamous $9.99 LaGuardia airport Chex Mix proves, these policies are often ridiculous and rarely enforced.
Stadiums and arenas are often financed by private activity bonds, which are tax deductible. As a condition of getting tax exemptions, venues financed by these bonds should be required to have strict street pricing policies. 
State and local policymakers should demand street pricing as part of any negotiated economic development deals for building or updating new venues and stadiums. And the Federal Aviation Administration should condition airport funding on street pricing policies and enforcement.
This is not just a pro-consumer idea. It’s pro-business and a good way to get every member of the family to become a fan. 
The proof is in the pudding (or maybe an ice cream helmet), as many teams have voluntarily instituted limits on concession prices. When the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened in 2017, the Atlanta Falcons instituted a fan-friendly pricing model, cutting concession prices by 50% compared to their previous stadium, offering $2 hot dogs and $5 beers. The discount has paid off as transactions, revenues and merchandise sales remain high, and the team’s fan experience tops the NFL. 
Portland International Airport has had strict street pricing in place since the 1980s, and enjoys retail sales well above the national average. 
When the New York Times explained Ron Gordon’s quest for hot dog justice in 1979, they wrote that “(i)n an era of constantly rising prices and giant corporations, (Gordon) had set out to prove that a lone individual could make a difference.” 
Not much has changed in the intervening 47 years. At a time when attendance at MLB games tops 70 million people, team owners and concessionaires need to remember that the love of the game comes from those special memories we have at the ballpark — of a walk-off home run or a special souvenir they’ll bring home from Oracle Park. 
Families are already getting squeezed by rising costs for everything from groceries to housing to utilities, and giant corporations institute ever-elaborate strategies and fees to get every last penny from consumers. Let’s not take away an affordable day at the ballpark. And let’s hope the billionaire sports owners remember that all we’re asking in return for huge public subsidies to build their stadiums is to offer fair and affordable concessions for loyal fans.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/092424_Oakland-Coliseum_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

Utilities are on board — but regulators turned them down.","In summary
California’s Public Advocate has been pressing for new utility fire maps since 2023. Utilities are on board — but regulators turned them down.


Weeks after deadly fires swept through Los Angeles County, the state regulator in charge of overseeing utility companies declined a request that would have required California’s largest utilities to update maps showing high fire threat areas. 
Consumer advocates argued for more up-to-date maps that could help assess risk to communities and impose more stringent requirements for utility infrastructure within high-threat areas.The maps show the risk of a wildfire caused by equipment owned by the state’s three major investor-owned utilities; they are separate from Cal Fire’s maps that show the potential for fires based on fuel in a given area. Originally filed eight years ago, the maps haven’t been updated as a whole. Instead, the utilities voluntarily file piecemeal updates to mark areas as at risk for fire, or no longer at risk, as they determine this with internal models. 
Even with these additions, the maps badly need updating, according to Cal Advocates, which represents ratepayers before the California Public Utilities Commission. 
A proposal from the agency would have required immediately updated maps and a shorter update period going forward. Originally filed in 2023 by the California Public Advocates Office, a state entity tasked with representing consumer interests, it had support from the three large power companies – Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. But in late January, the commission voted against the proposal, with four commissioners in opposition and one, who previously led Cal Advocates, who recused himself.
“The CPUC is focused on monitoring utilities’ compliance with numerous rules and programs directing their activities in high fire threat areas of California,” Adam Cranfill, spokesperson for the commission, said. “We cannot comment today on a potential future vehicle about the fire maps.”
As investigators examine the causes of the recent fires in Los Angeles County, Southern California Edison, which serves the area, has come under increased scrutiny. The utility said in a regulatory filing that its equipment may have played a role in starting the 799-acre Hurst Fire in the San Fernando Valley, and the company is investigating whether its equipment may have been involved in the 14,021-acre Eaton Fire that burned Altadena and parts of Pasadena.
Southern California Edison spokesperson Gabriela Ornelas declined to answer specific questions about the utility’s fire maps and whether updated maps would have helped prevent or extinguish the recent fires or its response. In a statement read over the phone, she said the company internally reviews the fire risk in its service area using multiple factors.
“Should that analysis determine that changes to the CPUC maps are warranted, SCE will file a petition to modify the map with the CPUC,” she said.
The commission’s fire risk maps sprung out of a regulatory response to a series of fires in late 2007 in Southern California, several of which were attributed to utility equipment. As a result, Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric, which serve the vast majority of the state, submitted maps in 2017 to identify potential areas where utility equipment could cause fires.
The three utilities are required to update their maps every 10 years, but both Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison have updated sections of their maps since the original filing. Southern California Edison is also currently seeking approval to update a portion of its maps. San Diego Gas & Electric has not updated its maps since 2017.
But Cal Advocates argued in its initial 2023 proposal that the maps need both a complete update and to be updated more frequently than once a decade. When Pacific Gas & Electric filed an update in 2023, for example, the new inclusions amounted to about 4.5% of its service area.
“Even its most recent mapping was in dire need of updating.”California Public Advocate in 2023 on a PG&E fire maps updated the same year
“Even its most recent mapping was in dire need of updating,” Cal Advocates said in its 2023 request. “This suggests public safety needs would be better met if utilities across the state update their wildfire risk mapping every five years.”
All three of the utilities with mapping requirements supported Cal Advocates’ position, which would allow the utilities to update the maps based on their own internal models. In a statement, Pacific Gas & Electric spokesperson Matt Nauman said the company updates its internal fire maps annually and expects to file updated maps with the commission at the end of this year.
Mussey Grade Road Alliance, a Ramona community advocacy group, pushed back on the proposal in May 2023 because of the discretion it would give the utilities to choose what counts as risky, which Cal Advocates later agreed with.
With the mapping comes additional regulatory scrutiny, as well as more stringent requirements for inspecting and maintaining utility infrastructure in high-risk areas.
The advocacy group’s Joseph Mitchell said the maps lack sufficient modeling for how wind affects the fires. The annual average of wind in an area doesn’t account for the short-term, significant gusts that were associated with large fires both recently and within the last decade. 
San Diego Gas & Electric comes the closest to accounting for this, he said. 
Alex Welling, spokesperson for San Diego Gas & Electric, said the utility regularly compares its maps against “wind speeds, historical fire data, fire modeling and more.” The utility will file to update the maps if it “identifies a need for updates,” Welling said. 
“Identifying the most dangerous areas for appropriate mitigation is important and continues to be important,” Mitchell said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/020825_Eaton-Power-Lines_JH_CM_29.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

Lujan Grisham has signed 128 bills — about 65% — of the 195 bills the Legislature passed, and vetoed two bills. That leaves 67 bills pending, including the $10.8 billion budget funding the state government in House Bill 2. 
Lujan Grisham has until Friday to approve or veto bills. Any legislation not signed by the April 11 deadline will not go into law, a move called a pocket veto. Lawmakers unanimously passed a measure to remove the governor’s pocket veto power in House Joint Resolution 2.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Before their failed attempt to violently overthrow the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the four men now charged with conspiracy in federal court spent time training, recruiting and planning their coup attempt in Utah. 
That’s according to a newly unsealed complaint, filed in Utah’s U.S. District Court over the weekend. If convicted, each man could face life in prison. 
It’s the latest development in the story that broke last year after armed rebels attempted to oust DRC President Félix Tshisekedi and Deputy Prime Minister for the Economy Vital Kamerhe.  
The ringleader, 41-year-old Christian Malanga, was shot and killed by DRC security forces during the attack on May 19, 2024 — his son and three associates were captured and sentenced to death by Congolese authorities. But on Tuesday, they were repatriated to the United States, and on Wednesday, the 82-page complaint against them was unsealed. 
Now, Marcel Malanga, 22, Tyler Thompson, 22, Benjamin Zalman-Polun, 37, and Joseph Peter Moesser, 67, have all been charged with various counts of conspiracy.

The failed takeover left at least six people dead, including Malanga, and 37 facing execution. For the past year it has made headlines worldwide, particularly for the Americans’ involvement and videos and images of the attack and capture that spread online. 
Now back in the U.S., the four men, if convicted, could be sentenced to life in prison for conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to bomb places of government facilities, and conspiracy to kill or kidnap persons in a foreign country. They also face a possible 15-year sentence for conspiracy to provide material support and resources.
Marcel Malanga and Thompson could each face an additional 15-year sentence for taking a firearm out of the United States to engage in a felony. 
Malanga, Thompson and Polun are expected to make their initial appearances at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn, New York, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, but will likely appear in Salt Lake City for further proceedings. Moesser is expected to make his initial appearance on Thursday, April 10 at the federal courthouse in Salt Lake City.  
Who are the men behind the attack? 
Christian Malanga was a DRC native with permanent U.S. residency who had been living in Utah since the late 1990s. He moved back to the DRC in 2006, enlisted in the military and became politically active, eventually leading the United Congolese Party, prosecutors say. He declared himself president of the “New Zaire Government in Exile” in 2017. 
His son, Marcel Malanga, was born in Utah and lived in West Jordan. According to the charges, he recruited people to join the rebel army, and supplied equipment, explosives and training. 
Thompson also lived in West Jordan, and according to court documents, was close with Marcel Malanga — they were high school classmates, football teammates, and worked together. FBI agents who worked the case believe he was tasked with being the drone operator. 
Polun had lived all over the world, according to the complaint, including Virginia, Nicaragua, England, Belgium, Republic of Georgia, Senegal and Eswatini. He took multiple trips to Utah between 2023 and 2024, and prosecutors say he was in Utah working construction with Marcel Malanga in winter 2024. Polun is described in the complaint as Christian Malanga’s chief of staff, and if the coup was successful, would “work in finance” under the new administration. 
And Moesser lived in West Valley City. His role, “among other things, was to design, manufacture, and provide assembly instructions for destructive devices. He also intended to provide sniper support during the attack,” according to the charges. 
New details on training and recruiting efforts in Utah 
The unsealed complaint shines a new light on how the four men trained, bought equipment and recruited people in the Salt Lake City area during the months leading up to the coup attempt. 
According to the complaint, Marcel Malanga and Thompson were offering potential recruits $50,000 to “go to Africa to ‘invade’ someone’s home and to join their military expedition,” according to court documents. One of the recruiting meetings took place between Polun, Marcel Malanga and an unnamed individual at a restaurant in West Jordan. 
Marcel Malanga at one point described the coup as an attempt to “go take out some terrorists,” comparing it to “Call of Duty stuff,” court documents read. He told another person it would be like “secret service work” for his father.

Marcel Malanga and Thompson bought and stockpiled drones to be used in the coup, at least one of which was later outfitted with a flame thrower in West Valley City. They also discussed equipping drones with pipe bombs at Moesser’s home, while Marcel Malanga bought drone equipment and had it shipped to an address in Draper, prosecutors say. 
Images included in the complaint show Moesser, sitting in his home in Utah, discussing an explosive device that could be dropped from a drone. And according to the complaint, Thompson practiced flying drones in Utah. 
Some of the firearms used in the attack were purchased in Salt Lake City, and the complaint includes two pictures of U.S. Customs and Border Protection forms signed by Marcel Malanga and Thompson, which were used to register and take firearms abroad. The forms were signed on April 9, 2024, in Salt Lake City. 
The men also practiced shooting firearms at a number of gun ranges in the Salt Lake City area, documenting it on their social media channels. Surveillance footage shows Marcel Malanga and Thompson training with handguns and rifles at a Utah shooting range. 
Marcel Malanga would eventually order 25 patches with the flag of the former Republic of Zaire from a Utah-based company — he was later caught on video during the attack with a similar patch on his arm. 
Both Marcel Malanga and Thompson departed on April 10, 2024, from the Salt Lake City International Airport, according to the charges, arriving in Johannesburg, South Africa, two days later, where they continued training. By the end of April 2024 they were in the DRC, scouting for the coup. 
 Failed coup leaves at least six people dead

The attempted coup began in the early morning hours of May 19, 2024, when an unknown number of armed men met Christian Malanga in a hotel in Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC. Between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., court documents say Christian Malanga and the men attacked a police station, where they stole more weapons. 
Then at 3:30 a.m., Christian Malanga carjacked a Range Rover belonging to someone identified as “victim #1,” whom Malanga shot and killed, according to the charges. At about 4:30 a.m., the rebel force arrived at the home of Kamerhe, the deputy prime minister, where one of the rebels and two guards were killed. 
By 5 a.m., the rebels traveled to the Palais de la Nation, the DRC president’s official residence and workplace — up to this point, Marcel Malanga, Thompson, and Polun’s involvement in the fighting is unclear in the complaint. But according to social media footage, the three men accompanied the rebel forces to the president’s home. 
After being confronted by DRC security forces, Christian Malanga was shot and killed, and Marcel Malanga, Thompson and Polun fled. By 10 a.m., the men were captured. At least six people were killed. 
Moesser’s involvement that morning is unclear, and he is not mentioned in the complaint’s summary of the attack. He “also stated that he had every intent on joining” the rebel army “in Africa to participate in the attack. He stated that he was going to be a sniper,” the complaint reads.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee on Tuesday approved legislation to overhaul the state’s student funding formula.
SB 305, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would establish the Renewing Alabama’s Investment in Student Excellence (RAISE) program and create the RAISE Fund to help address the needs of underserved students through a new funding system. 
The state currently distributes money to schools based on average daily attendance. The new formula would provide weighted funding for students in poverty, English language learners, special education and gifted categories, as well as charter school students.
“An English language learner that doesn’t speak English costs more to educate that child than a native Alabamian that comes from an English-speaking home, and so we want to help those school districts that have those challenges with additional resources,” Orr said after the committee meeting.

The committee also approved a related bill that will transfer $375 million from the state’s Educational Opportunities Reserve Fund, a state savings account for budget surpluses intended for educational initiatives, into the newly created RAISE Fund. Orr said that the transfer is intended to fund the program for the first three years, though he left the possibility of additional appropriations open in a conversation with reporters after the meeting.
“We could do more if we wanted to. There’s nothing that requires us to, but we wanted to start drawing down from the Educational Opportunity Fund . . . we don’t know about the economy, and we see what’s going on with Wall Street and tariffs, so we want to hold some back in case we need it,” Orr said.
The senator said during the committee meeting that $100 million of the $375 million would be spent on the move to the new funding system in the first year; $125 million for the second year and $175 million for the third year.
Orr said it was important to give school districts long-term stability. 
“We don’t want to pull the rug from beneath them… they go out and hire teachers and make investments relying on us,” he said. “This is a long-term commitment.”
The legislation came after months of discussions between lawmakers and advocates who pushed for a weighted student formula that would provide a base amount per student with additional weights for different student needs, such as English language learners.
The bill passed without much discussion, though one senator voiced his support for the measure.
“There are so many of the one-size-fits-all solutions that we’re forced into, many times for political reasons,” said Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road. “I look forward to supporting this program.”
Orr said the bill is a step toward more equity in education.
“It’s a challenge and the research shows to educate children coming in those particular areas, it certainly costs more money … but if you don’t start, you won’t get there,” Orr said.
The bill now moves to the full Senate for consideration.

Perry Courthouse in Columbia on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A civil rights group asked a federal judge Wednesday to pause enforcement of a South Carolina law that keeps secret everything about the people and companies involved in executions.
The requested suspension of penalties for disclosing the confidential information would not affect Friday’s scheduled execution by firing squad. Rather, the American Civil Liberties Union is seeking to block charges indefinitely while its challenge to the secrecy law progresses through the courts.
No other death warrant of an inmate is imminent. The pending execution of Mikal Mahdi is the last of a series expected after a state Supreme Court ruling allowed executions to resume last fall.
But if the state can no longer guarantee people involved in executions that they will be free from public scrutiny, the state would again be unable to carry out executions scheduled in the future, attorney Grayson Lambert told U.S. District Judge Joseph Anderson.
“It’s about public safety and protecting those involved in the execution process,” said Lambert, who represents Gov. Henry McMaster.
But attorneys for the ACLU’s state chapter argued the law, which legislators expanded in 2023, violates citizens’ First Amendment rights to free speech by preventing them from learning or sharing information.
Anyone who violates the law, which since 2010 has shielded the identities of the execution team, can be sentenced to up to three years in prison.
In 2023, the secrecy law was extended in a successful attempt to restock the drugs for a lethal injection execution, with the definition of “execution team” broadened to include any person or company involved with supplying the drugs or medical equipment. The state’s supply had expired a decade earlier, and officials couldn’t restock since pharmaceutical companies didn’t want to be associated with selling the drugs that kill people.
The lack of lethal injection drugs began providing inmates a reprieve in December 2020, when the first scheduled execution was put on hold.
Corrections Director Bryan Stirling tried contacting drug manufacturers, drug compounders and even other states in an effort to get the drugs needed to carry out lethal injections, said Lambert, attorney for Gov. Henry McMaster.
“We tried, we tried, we tried, and it didn’t work,” Lambert said.
But within months of the 2023 law granting secrecy to any supplier, manufacturer, compounder or pharmacist involved with providing the drugs, Stirling was able to secure them.
Since September, four condemned men have been put to death. Three of them chose lethal injection. Mahdi is set to be the fifth man executed and the second in state history by firing squad.
The question in the case heard Wednesday comes down to whether or not the law was put in place specifically to keep advocates for inmates from learning more about the execution process.
The law isn’t a constitutional violation because it applies equally across the board, Lambert argued.
The ACLU pointed to a public records request denied under the law as proof it stifled the group’s ability to gain information.
But everyone’s denied that information, Lambert said: “If a pro-death penalty group would’ve sent the same request, that group would’ve gotten nothing in response for the exact same reason.”
Knowing as much as possible about the drug manufacturers allows for greater public discourse, attorneys for the ACLU argued.
If the state were using a disreputable or dangerous company, for example, people would be able to raise that as a reason not to carry out executions, said Jonathan Spratley, who represents the ACLU.
The ACLU claims it has information that falls under the law but won’t say what it is, who provided it or when the team got it. That’s because of the law’s penalties for disclosure, according to the group.
“This case is not about whether you agree or disagree with the death penalty,” Spratley said. “It’s about whether South Carolina can place a muzzle on citizens who seek to scrutinize and criticize” the process.
That’s especially important amid questions over the efficacy of the drug, Spratley said.
He pointed to autopsy reports that suggested a prolonged death, with inmates declared dead 20 minutes after their executions began, and that their lungs filled with fluid.
In response, experts for the state have said that’s typical of an execution, and nothing has gone wrong.
The judge seemed skeptical that the drugs didn’t knock out the condemned men long before their declared time of death. He recalled his own recent surgery involving anesthesia, noting he was told to count down from 10 after the drugs started flowing.
“I got to nine and I was out, and I didn’t feel one thing — not one thing — as they were cutting into my muscles,” Anderson said. “Why is that different when we take a life?”
Anderson asked both legal teams whether he could prevent enforcement of most of the law but leave intact the part barring disclosure of the pharmaceutical companies’ names.
“Does the public have a burning interest in knowing whether the chemicals are made by ABC pharmaceutical or XYZ pharmaceutical?” Anderson said. “Does it really matter?”
Lambert said any information at all about the companies could make it easier for people to identify them.
“In a 100-piece jigsaw puzzle, if we give you 87 pieces, you don’t need the last 13 pieces to figure out what the picture is,” Lambert said.
The state is seeking a dismissal of the case. If it proceeds, the evidence the state will need to prove its case could violate the law it’s trying to defend, Lambert said.
Anderson said he would issue a decision within several days.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/court-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 09:10:09.221953

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)The Nevada Realtors Association hopes to kill legislation that authorizes one year of rent stabilization for seniors and puts modest regulations on the collection of rental application fees, despite backing the same bill in the previous legislative session.
Assembly Bill 280, which passed out of the Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee last week on a party line vote, revives a similar effort from 2023 to limit landlords from raising rents more than 5% on tenants 62 years or older or relies on Social Security payments through the end of 2026. 
This year’s bill, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, also requires landlords to refund application fees if they don’t screen a tenant who applied for the unit. 
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed the 2023 version of the bill saying the legislation was admirable but “needlessly heavy-handed in its approach.”
Nevada Realtors, who typically oppose expanded tenant protections, backed the bill during the 2023 session.
Keith Lynam, president of the Nevada Realtors during that time, and Jonathan Norman,  the statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers, helped present alongside Jauregui that year.
In 2023, Lyman called the bill “common sense solutions to affordable housing for those who are leasing and renting homes,” Jauregui noted while describing the bill to the committee during last month’s hearing. He gave his full-throated support of the bill, she added. 
The bill’s intent stayed the same. The Nevada Realtors’ position changed. 
Azim Jessa, a lobbyist for Nevada Realtors, told lawmakers the group changed its opinion because of “market statistics” that showed “the average rental price for a single family home dropped 5.9%.”
Rent prices have soared drastically since 2020, with elected officials noting rents spiked between 20% and 30% within the first two years of the pandemic. 
Jauregui called the association’s reversal this session “deeply disappointing,” especially since it was the association, along with legal aid, who worked for months to craft the provisions of the 2023 bill. 
When AB 280 was first heard in March, it originally sought the same 2023 provision that limited landlords from increasing rents on seniors living on fixed incomes by more than 10%.
Jauregui said during the March 26 bill hearing that while she thought a 10% cap was too high, the limit was included out of “a consensus” and the language was agreed upon by both the Realtors Association and legal aid groups.
Between that hearing and committee passing AB 280 last week, Jauregui amended the language to reduce the cap to 5% because “there is a party who did not negotiate in good faith.”
Jauregui said the bill is still a pilot program that would allow lawmakers to assess its effectiveness. 
“The key is that we take action now rather than allow seniors and those on fixed incomes to continue suffering, face eviction or end up homeless,” she said. 
Though Lombardo vetoed the bill in 2023, his message didn’t mention anything about the temporary rent stabilization it sought for seniors and those relying on federal assistance. 
At the time, he wrote that the bill “is an unreasonable restraint on standard business activity” and  the legislation would prevent landlords “from collecting, and retaining, any fee related to the rental of a dwelling unit.”  
AB 280, like its 2023 version, seeks to prevent landlords from collecting application fees even when they don’t use the money to screen tenants. 
“If ten applications come in for one unit and the first application is taken, then the fees for the other nine would have to be returned,” Jauregui said. “Any hard costs wouldn’t have to be returned.”
The legislation would also require landlords to include an appendix in the lease listing fees that can be charged.  
Ben Iness, the coalition coordinator for the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance, said the bill doesn’t go far enough. The coalition testified in neutral. 
“In terms of scope and applicability, we would love to see this applied to all Nevadans,” he said. “A lot of the comments focus on supply and demand and ignore things like RealPage that interfere with the market.”
RealPage, a rental pricing software firm, was accused of colluding with corporate landlords to use algorithms to collect lease transaction data in order to artificially inflate rents via price fixing. The company has denied wrongdoing. 
The allegation against the company, as well as other property management companies, has resulted in lawsuits across the country and legislative efforts to rein in the practice. 
In the absence of regulation to prevent rent price fixing, Iness said the market isn’t fair for renters. 
“Rent stabilization makes sure things stay attainable, accessible and affordable,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SandraJauregui-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-10 09:10:09.221953

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Immigration advocates urged members of an Alabama House committee Wednesday to reject a bill targeting immigrants and potentially those who provide assistance to them.
SB 53, sponsored by Sen. Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, would require law enforcement to determine the legal status of those they have a “reasonable suspicion” of being in the country without status during stops. The bill also makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a person to “knowingly transport into this state another individual if he or she knows is an illegal alien,” which the bill defines as human smuggling.
“This bill came for our sheriffs, to give them the tools that they need,” Kitchens said prior to public hearing on the bill before the House Judiciary Committee. “If someone is arrested, if someone is brought into a jail, whether it is a state, local or county jail, they have been arrested. This provides them really with a process, the clarity they need for the process to determine their immigration status.”

Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, who spoke directly against the human smuggling provision in the legislation, saying it would make it illegal for family members to check on those threatened with deportation.
“Any family that is trying to make sure their family is not separated in the case of deportation has to leave the state in order to make sure that happens,” Hamilton said. “This provision would make that impossible. Not only is it a huge risk for families to drive themselves across state lines with everything that is going on, but to criminalize anybody who just wants to be a good Samaritan and help, to make it a felony for someone to do that, is extremely concerning to us.”
Shane Isner, senior minister with First Christian Church, said the bill conflicts with Christian values.
“I am here to say that compassion is not a crime,” he said. “Compassion in the Scripture of my religion is a command; it is a duty.”
He then invoked the parable of the Good Samaritan.
“At the end of the parable, Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Go and do likewise,’” Isner said.
The committee did not vote on the legislation on Wednesday. A vote could take place next week.
SB 53 is receiving its first consideration in the House after it was approved in the Senate despite gathering sharp criticism over language in the original bill that echoed a section of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, which forced officials to help slave catchers trying to return people into bondage and threatened those who assisted escapes from enslavement with jail time and fines. The language was removed before the Senate approved the bill. .
The bill provides a few exceptions to the smuggling provision, such as attorneys who are transporting their clients to different immigration facilities or teachers who are taking students on a field trip.
SB 53 is one of several bills targeting immigration currently working their way through the Legislature. In the past month, members of the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation that allows local law enforcement to enter into agreements with the federal government to enforce the country’s immigration laws and require labor brokers to register with the Alabama Department of Workforce and provide the state agency with a list of foreign nationals they recruit and employ for clients.
The committee also approved a bill that enhances the penalties for crimes committed by people not legally authorized to live in the U.S.
Rep. Tim Wadsworth, R-Arley, also had concerns with the human smuggling provision. As an immigration attorney, said he does not typically drive his clients to immigration centers to address a problem with their immigration status, they have family members or other people do that.

He’s just spent the afternoon in a safe, vibrant place where he could play, learn, and grow, at no cost to our family: the library.
Libraries are much more than buildings full of books. As a social work educator, I helped launch a social work internship at a local branch in 2024. The social work intern quickly became, and has remained, an integral part of the library, helping patrons navigate everything from housing challenges to emotional crises. It was a natural fit, because libraries today are true community hubs.
That’s why recent waves of budget cuts, closures, and censorship should concern all of us. These aren’t just policy decisions. They’re attacks on one of the last truly accessible, inclusive, and free public spaces we have left. Libraries are often the quiet heroes, filling gaps in underfunded schools, overwhelmed health systems, and stretched social services.

For children especially, libraries offer so much more than just stories; they offer belonging. Kids can find books that reflect their hopes, dreams, and identities. And for those young people facing great hardship or lacking support, a library can be a place of comfort and vital self-discovery. In the stacks, they can find themselves and the tools to navigate a world that doesn’t always feel safe or welcoming. That kind of access isn’t a luxury, it’s a lifeline, and it should be protected.
Yet across the country, libraries are being targeted for carrying books that include LGBT+ characters, confront the realities of racism, or that make some people uncomfortable. This effort to silence needed and varied voices is not some harmless “culture war.” It erases history and identity. It also sends a chilling message to those still figuring out who they are: “You don’t belong.” One group being particularly targeted by this type of behavior is trans youth.
This fight over books may seem symbolic to some, but the related issues are painfully real. As Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, recently shared, 86% of trans youth report feeling suicidal and 56% have attempted suicide. Whatever your politics are, we should all agree on this: No child should be made to feel unsafe, unloved, or unworthy. Removing books that reflect people’s lives or offer them hope is not protecting anyone. It is needlessly cruel and deeply isolating for people who may need the support most.
Fairhope Public Library supporters raise money to replace funds state plans to withhold

Libraries are also a lifeline for low-income families and individuals. They provide free Wi-Fi for job seekers and many locations offer other types of assistance like mental health referrals, literacy programs, self-care workshops, and voter registration assistance. So, when we cut library funding, we’re not just changing a budget, we’re gutting a key part of our nation’s social safety net.
When a library closes because of those budget cuts, communities lose a lot more than books. Individuals and families lose essential services and safe spaces, and children lose a place which encourages their growth and curiosity. And when we censor what children can read, we don’t just limit their access to information, we limit their ability to cope and dream, as well as who they can become.
We talk a lot as a society about wanting the best future possible for our children. But building that future requires more than words. It requires investing in places that feed their mind, nurture their interests, and help them feel seen. That place, for so many, is the library. When we invest in libraries, we invest in our neighbors, our children, and a more informed and compassionate society.
During National Library Week — as a parent, a social worker, and lifelong lover of books — I am reflecting on the important role libraries play. They are sources of information, imagination, and connection.
Cutting library budgets doesn’t just close doors, it silences stories, limits dreams, and deepens divides. And censoring books isn’t protection. It’s restriction. Every child deserves a place where their imagination can run wild and every adult deserves a space where they can access tools to grow, thrive, or just be. During this National Library Week, libraries deserve more than just our gratitude; they deserve our protection.

The students took a field trip there on April 2, 2025, to do water experiments. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)SANDYSTON — Near the brook that feeds Lake Wapalanne, the city kids teeter and trip over mossy rocks on their way through the woods to collect water samples.
They’ll test for dissolved oxygen, nitrates, acidity, and more, but they’ll also test their grit as they navigate nature 75 miles from their New Brunswick high school. The mud sucks the sneaker off one teen’s foot, leaving his classmates cackling. Another student pirouettes at the water’s edge to avoid falling in.
Barbara Cabrera, their teacher, knows the field trip to the New Jersey School of Conservation in Sussex County holds valuable lessons beyond chemistry.
“I don’t even have windows in my classroom,” she said.
School of Conservation officials warn that field trips like this could soon end.
Under Gov. Phil Murphy’s $58.1 billion budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins July 1, state funding for the 240-acre school in Stokes State Forest would fall from $2.8 million to $500,000.
Kerry Kirk Pflugh, the school’s executive director, said that cut likely would wipe out all programs and most staff at the state-owned site, the oldest year-round, residential environmental education center in the country.
“The funding is not only critical for us to be able to deliver the programming that we’re legislatively obligated to deliver, but it’s critical to provide the means for these students to have these kinds of experiences that can be life-changing,” Pflugh said. “In today’s climate, there is no greater benefit to a young person than to be in the outdoors, learning, having an immersive experience, seeing how it relates to their life, and learning how to more effectively work with one another.”
The school has been here before.

Montclair State University, which had managed the site since 1981, closed it in 2020 after a decade-long decline in state support. It reopened in 2021 after nonprofit the Friends of the New Jersey School of Conservation contracted with the state to manage it.
The school doubled its reach from 2023 to 2024, when more than 2,200 people from 75 schools across 13 counties attended its programs and over 200 teachers visited for 13 professional development workshops, according to Tanya Sulikowski, the school’s director of education. The school should double its reach again this year, Sulikowski added.
Renovations are underway — and completed in some places — at many of the site’s 57 buildings. Some of its more dilapidated structures date back to the 1930s, when a work relief program under President Franklin D. Roosevelt built the camp that the state transformed into the School of Conservation in 1949.
State funding in the current year’s budget fell short of the $3 million school officials requested last year. Murphy had proposed $800,000, but several state legislators secured the school an additional $2 million. For the coming fiscal year, the school sought $3.5 million, Pflugh said.
“A $500,000 allocation right now would devastate us. There is absolutely no way we can operate with that kind of money. It won’t cover our staffing. It won’t cover the restoration that we need to do,” she said. “We would probably have, like, a skeleton crew coming through to make sure that the buildings are not being vandalized. But there really wouldn’t be any programming.”
Murphy spokeswoman Maggie Garbarino declined to comment on the school’s budget concerns, directing the New Jersey Monitor to comments Murphy made in his February budget address about needed “belt-tightening.” Murphy’s budget plan recommends eliminating most new direct grants included in the current budget and reducing older direct grants.
Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) was one of the state legislators who secured an extra $2 million for the school last year. He told the New Jersey Monitor he has long supported the “very special” school, which he said serves to inspire the next generation of environmentalists.
“I thought it was something very worthy of what’s a relatively small sum of money for the benefit that it derives. But it’s a difficult budget year, and all over our state are nonprofits and other type of endeavors that are in need of resources,” McKeon said. “But the governor didn’t zero them out, which is a good thing. And we’ll see. The budget is a dynamic document, and it’s something that continues to be a priority for me. So we’ll see the best that we can do for them.”

Pflugh said the school has expanded its efforts to fundraise privately and partnered with universities and community groups to build a research consortium, recognizing that the school serves as “a living laboratory.”
The New Brunswick students who visited last week were from Pathways in Technology Early College High School, or P-TECH. About half the students that visit come from low-income and urban districts, with the School of Conservation subsidizing the trips to remove pricey hurdles like buses that otherwise might make field trips impossible, Sulikowski said.
Sophomore Anthony Rodriguez, 15, called the field trip “great.”
“Better than a lab, because we’re actually outside,” he said.

Rodriguez and his P-TECH classmates had traveled up for the day, but the school has several cabins with bunkrooms for overnight stays.
“Overnights are really where the magic happens,” said Allyson Lance, the school’s environmental education coordinator. “Being able to be in the woods and sit around the campfire and stay up until 3 a.m. with your friends is really where a lot of kids get that, like, spark.”
That spark is one of many reasons the school’s supporters hope state lawmakers will ultimately come through with more funding. Pflugh also points to the school’s role in educating teachers to carry out a climate change curriculum state lawmakers mandated in 2020.
“We are in a very difficult fiscal climate right now, and we are one of many organizations who have need,” she said. “But this is a state asset, and we’re stewards of a state property. So we feel like we should always be partnered with the state to help take care of their property.”

Bob Ferguson announced this week for the state’s Fish and Wildlife Commission.
In January, shortly after he took office, Ferguson halted two nominations former Gov. Jay Inslee made to the commission, including the reappointment of Tim Ragen, a retired marine mammal expert who had served as the panel’s vice chair since last year and had strong support from wildlife protection groups. 
Though Ferguson removed him from the nine-member commission, Ragen remained in the running for the job alongside 13 other eligible candidates, but the governor ultimately cut him loose. And he nixed Inslee’s other nominee — Lynn O’Connor, who operated a sign company in northeast Washington for two decades and was a former park aide and ranger.
Instead, he reappointed two commissioners — Jim Anderson and Molly Linville, who O’Connor would have replaced. Both Anderson and Linville are backed by hunting and fishing groups and a coalition of tribes that support hatchery fish production. Some environmental groups in Washington oppose fish hatcheries, pointing to evidence that they are a threat to wild fish populations.
Ferguson also appointed Victor Garcia, who is less known to key groups lobbying the governor’s office on the nominations. Garcia, a retired teacher, is a longtime hunter and fisherman who worked earlier in his career as a commercial fisherman in the Bering Sea region.
“We’re going to have people that we can work with again,” Ron Garner, state board president for Puget Sound Anglers, said by phone on Tuesday. “I’m excited.”
Lisa Wilson, vice chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission and a member of the Lummi Indian Business Council, said she was, “Just really happy with feeling heard by the new governor.”
“We did have concerns about the appointments that Inslee left us with,” she added. “It took a lot of footwork to reverse that.”
But for wildlife advocates and those who want to see the commission expand its focus beyond species that are hunted and fished, to look more at broader issues around the ecological value of wildlife and strengthening biodiversity, Ferguson’s picks were a deep disappointment.
“Governor Ferguson, by aligning himself with special interests of hunting and angling … has taken a step backward from a more forward-thinking agency that will protect the wildlife trust for current and future generations,” said Fred Koontz, a former commissioner who resigned in 2021 after clashing with hunting interests.
The group Washington Wildlife First, which had pressed for Ragen’s reappointment, issued a statement saying that they felt “betrayed” by Ferguson’s actions.
“Governor Ferguson insisted that he wanted to create a more ‘balanced’ Fish and Wildlife Commission, but instead, he has tilted it away from the values of Washingtonians, and toward the powerful special interests that have long controlled state fish and wildlife policy,” the group said in a statement shared on Wednesday.
The Fish and Wildlife Commission establishes policy and provides oversight for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. The commissioners are appointed by the governor and serve six-year terms.
While for many state residents the commission is a lesser-known government entity, it’s a frequent venue for thorny debates. For example, last year, the commission took sharply divided votes to maintain state-level endangered species protections for gray wolves. At a meeting last week, commissioners were dealing with hunting rules for cougars and black bears.
Contentious process
Ferguson said he opted to pull back Inslee’s nominees because of a December report from the nonpartisan William D. Ruckelshaus Center that highlighted criticism of the commission, and after “outreach from multiple individuals, entities, and tribes.”
The Ruckelshaus Center report included findings from more than 100 interviews with people familiar with the agency. It said interviewees described the commission as “dysfunctional, politically polarized, and caught up in conflict,” and specifically raised concerns about a lack of transparency and selection criteria for commissioners.
“Molly, Jim and Victor offer deep and varied experience, as well as unique perspectives,” Ferguson said in a statement. “The Ruckelshaus report raised serious concerns about the commission, and we believe these individuals will help to address those issues.”
The governor’s office has emphasized that the Senate granted unanimous approval for the governor’s request to cancel Inslee’s nominations of Ragen and O’Connor.
One group to pressure Ferguson on the nominations is known as the Hatchery Coalition. It consists of four tribes — the Lummi, Tulalip, Upper Skagit and Squaxin — as well as Puget Sound Anglers, and a sport fishing charter company based in Ilwaco. Garner and Wilson were both involved in the coalition’s outreach to the governor’s office.
The coalition backed the reappointment of Anderson and Linville. They also wanted to see former state lawmaker Brian Blake appointed. Here, Ferguson didn’t go along. The Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission pushed for the same three candidates.
In another camp were advocates like those with Washington Wildlife First, which describes itself as wanting to “transform Washington’s relationship with its fish and wildlife from an approach centered around consumptive use to a more democratic paradigm that values science, recognizes the intrinsic value of individual animals, and prioritizes protecting, preserving and perpetuating wild lives.”
Advocates on this side pressed for the reappointment of Ragen, who was previously the executive director and scientific program director of the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission.
In mid-March, 74 scientists, conservationists, and environmental advocates wrote to Ferguson urging him to reverse his removal of Ragen from the commission.
“Now more than ever, Washington’s Fish and Wildlife Commission needs leaders with a strong record of decision-making grounded in science,” they wrote.
Ragen’s “unparalleled experience and deep understanding of marine ecosystems — particularly those critical to the survival of Southern Resident killer whales and wild salmon — make him uniquely qualified to guide complex fisheries and wildlife management decisions,” they added.
Koontz was one of the people who signed onto the letter and suggested Ragen, with his credentials as a Ph.D. conservation scientist, had become a symbol of efforts to move the commission in a new direction. “The status quo is not moving us forward,” he added.
But during his time on the commission, Ragen had frictions with those involved with the Hatchery Coalition, particularly Wilson, who flagged concerns she had with Ragen in a letter last year to Inslee. That letter was later forwarded to Ferguson’s office.
Dane Czarnecki, a hunting rights activist, was among those unhappy with recent shifts at the commission. “They moved away from hearing their traditional stakeholders,” he said.
“We can hopefully start bridging these divides,” Czarnecki added.
Anderson, one of the two commissioners Ferguson reappointed, has been on the commission since 2019. He served as executive director of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission from 1985 to 2005 and has hunted and fished since childhood.
Linville has also been on the commission since 2019. In the early 2000s, she worked as a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and now runs a 6,000-acre cattle ranch near Wenatchee that she and her husband took over after her father-in-law passed away.
Who is Victor Garcia?
Garcia, Ferguson’s new appointee, taught biology and other science courses in Washington public schools, most recently in Anacortes. He’s originally from Gray’s Harbor County and has a bachelor’s degree in marine zoology from the University of Washington and a master’s in science education from Vanderbilt University.
“I grew up digging razor clams, dipping smelt up at Kalaloch, crabbing, hunting deer and elk, hiking, kayaking, everything that one does around here when you really love being outdoors,” he told the Standard in a phone interview on Tuesday.
Garcia said he left behind commercial fishing in the 1990s when he started a family. He also worked over the years as a biologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
He suggested his background and interests give him a unique perspective to bring to the commission. “I do citizen science, I work on eelgrass assessment, salmon spawning surveys. I’m a hunter, but I’m also in Audubon,” he said. “I’ve gone all over the world to view specific birds. But, every now and then, I do hunt some of them.”
“I think my job is to really listen and look at the science,” he added, “and not go into it with any one polarized, preconceived notion.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fish-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 07:03:48.943305

HB 244, sponsored by Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, would prohibit public school teachers at all grade levels from teaching or discussing gender identity or sexuality. The legislation also prohibits the display of pride flags and insignia in the classroom.
An amendment from Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, was adopted unanimously to remove a portion of the bill that would prohibit referring to students by their preferred gender if it conflicts with their assigned sex at birth.

HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify. 
“Some felt there was another bill that is addressing that issue. So it’s still there to some degree,” Butler said.
The law currently bans such discussions from kindergarten to fifth grade, but Butler said the expansion aligns with President Donald Trump’s agenda and executive order.
“We’re trying to get as close as we could to President Trump’s executive order,” Butler said.
The House Education Policy Committee held a public hearing on the legislation last week, which drew significant criticism from mostly transgender and nonbinary Alabamians. Former Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, the first openly gay representative elected to the Alabama Legislature, said her sexuality did not make her colleagues gay.
“And you all who served with me know that. Just because I served with you doesn’t mean that you became gay either,” she said last week.
Butler said the law will improve public education. 
“If you saw the headlines yesterday, there were almost 40,000 applicants for the CHOOSE Act, telling you that clearly there’s dissatisfaction of what we’re doing with public education, and this will actually help,” he said.
The bill will now be considered by the full House.

Hudson, who represents the 9th District and heads the House Republicans’ campaign arm, made news about a month ago when he told his GOP colleagues not to hold in-person town halls where they would come face-to-face with angry people and Democrats filling the venues.  
So Democrats have decided to bring what they’re calling one of their People’s Town Halls to Hudson’s district on April 24.

The district extends from part of Cumberland County and Hoke up to Alamance and part of Guilford.  US Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida will be there, according to the Democratic National Committee. 
So far Democrats have held dozens of these gatherings across the country. The next round is kicking in as President Donald Trump’s on-again-off-again tariffs have consumers on edge, and the federal cuts to social safety-net programs loom. 
“Here’s the upshot: Democrats are listening, Republicans are cowering, and folks are as fired up as I’ve ever seen,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a statement. “In both red and blue communities, people are sick and tired of Donald Trump and Elon Musk destroying the economy, threatening health care and Social Security, and making life worse for families.”

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/ Arizona Mirror)The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.
Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

I’m a Florida native, so let me clue you in. Lean in close and I’ll whisper it in your ear. Are you ready?
The Florida Legislature contains more cuckoos than a Swiss clock factory.
Now that you’re aware of this fact, how are you holding up? How’s your blood pressure? Can you handle the truth?
You want some evidence? Just last year, a legislator claimed his new anti-bear bill was necessary because there were bears on crack invading people’s houses. This was, of course, a complete fantasy. Yet his colleagues didn’t question his sanity or call the paramedics. They just passed the bill. It’s the law now!
This year there’s one that’s even kookier. I am referring to the so-called “chemtrails” bill.
In case you’re unfamiliar with that debunked conspiracy theory, the folks who believe in “chemtrails” are convinced the government (or maybe it’s the Illuminati) is dispatching planes to fly over us unsuspecting Americans and spray chemicals on us.
Why? The chemtrails can change the weather, say the diehards. Or maybe they can control people’s minds. Or maybe they’re just going to poison everybody they don’t like. Who knows? After all, it’s a secret, like the 1947 UFO crash landing in New Mexico.
Anyway, there’s a bill in the Legislature to track and attack chemtrails. Instead of being laughed out of the Capitol building, as it deserves, the bill was just passed by the full Senate, because that’s what our state’s elected leaders are like right now. I wish I could tell you the “Looney Tunes” theme song played while they voted.
  Sen. Ileana Garcia, via Florida Senate
“The measure (SB 56), sponsored by Miami Republican Ileana Garcia, would prohibit the injection, release, or dispersion of any means of a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere for the purpose of affecting the climate,” my colleague Mitch Perry reported in the Phoenix last week. “Any person or corporation who conducts such geoengineering or weather modification activity would be subject to a third-degree felony charge, with fines up to $100,000.”
The bill would require the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to set up a hotline so anyone concerned about streaks in the sky can call and report them. I’m sure the DEP will jump right on those reports, just the way the agency has jumped on reports of rampant water pollution that fuels toxic algae blooms, kills seagrass, and leaves manatees to starve.
I tried calling Sen. Garcia to ask her some questions about her bill.  While I waited to talk to her, I was struck by a subversive thought:
What if the chemtrails bill becomes law and we folks who still live in the real world use it to flip the script? What if we employ its provisions to go after the people who really ARE changing the weather — with their greenhouse gas emissions?
 A healthy skepticism
The most shocking thing about this chemtrails bill is not that it was filed — filed, I should add, by a senator who won her seat by just 32 votes, thanks to an illegal ghost candidate scheme backed by Florida Power & Light.
Nor is the most shocking thing that it passed one house of our Legislature by a vote of 28-9 and now is headed for the other.
No, what’s shocking is that it was endorsed by Senate President Ben Albritton and Gov. Ron DeSantis, two allegedly well-educated people. At this rate, they’ll next endorse a taxpayer-funded expedition to explore how we ended up living  inside a Hollow Earth.
Actually, DeSantis’ endorsement isn’t that much of a surprise. He’s happy to appease the Tinfoil Hat Brigade if it gets him a mention on Fox News or its imitators.
Remember, DeSantis is the guy who appointed as his surgeon general the world’s biggest vaccine skeptic and now lets him run around the state trying to convince everyone to stop preventing children’s tooth decay. I sometimes wonder if he and RFK Jr. share a brain worm.
  Senate President Ben Albritton via his campaign website
But Albritton’s comments threw me. He’s a longtime citrus man who’s familiar with the need for accurate weather forecasts. Yet he actually called this lunacy “a great piece of legislation” that would address “real concerns from our constituents.”
If some of those constituents also think their elected politicians are all lizard people, presumably he’d be fine with legislation requiring a reptilian DNA test before administering the oath of office.
“I have heard the conspiracy theories out there,” Albritton said about Garcia’s bill, “but the fact is we should not be shutting down legitimate concerns. Healthy skepticism is important. There’s a lot we don’t know in this field of science and people are rightfully concerned.”
Because I grew up in Florida, I have a healthy skepticism toward anything Florida politicians say. Albritton’s statement suggests that I’m right to be skeptical because there’s a lot that’s wrong with his comments.
We actually know quite a lot about the weather modification attempts. We know they don’t work and have mostly been discontinued.
Florida law currently requires anyone who wants to modify the weather to get a permit first. A Senate bill analysis of SB 56 points out, “There have been no applications for weather modification licenses in the past 10 years.”
Four years ago, eight Western states tried cloud seeding to produce rains to end a lengthy drought. However, Scientific American reported, “there is little evidence to show that the process is increasing precipitation.”
Yet “weather modification” is what our Legislature chooses to tackle instead of lowering property insurance rates, boosting educational test scores, or any one of a dozen more important issues. Maybe they’re under some bizarre mind control method that requires them to be ineffective at good governing.
 Legitimate concerns
Albritton’s statement about people being “rightfully concerned” about chemtrails sounds like he’s endorsing the bogus claims that spread last year that the government steered two hurricanes to clobber specific communities ahead of the election.
Those rumors were, of course, lies spread by the unscrupulous to fool the gullible. They became so pervasive that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had to put out a press release denying it.
“NOAA does not modify the weather, nor does it fund, participate in or oversee cloud seeding or any other weather modification activities,” it said.
Given how Elon Musk is rapidly dismantling the agency now, I doubt they can control the thermostat in their office buildings, much less the weather.
I wish Albritton were as supportive of the “legitimate concerns” many of us Floridians feel about climate change.
We’re on the front lines of it, with our rising sea levels, more intense hurricanes, higher storm surges, and increased temperatures even at night. It’s hurting everything from our seafood industry to our sea turtle nesting. Heck, it’s even hurting Albritton’s own industry, agriculture.
Hard-headed property insurance companies recognize the dangers and disruptions of climate change. Why can’t our state officials?

“If lawmakers want to protect Floridians by addressing substances affecting the temperature, weather, and climate, they should hold power companies and the oil and gas industry accountable,” said longtime Florida climate activist Susan Glickman of the CLEO Institute, a non-profit dedicated to climate education and advocacy. “The pollution they release is warming the climate in increasingly extreme and deadly ways.”
But last year the Legislature voted to delete most references to climate change from state law under the well-known scientific theory of “If We Don’t Talk About It, Surely It Will Go Away.” Given how we were all beaten up by intense hurricanes and big storm surges last year, I don’t think it went away.
Fortunately, I see a way to take this “chemtrails” bill and turn it into a “let’s fight climate change” bill. Let me explain.
 Contrail confusion
I have a confession to make: Every time I read someone’s rants about chemtrails, I always crack up. That’s because I always picture Cary Grant fleeing the evil crop-duster in the movie “North by Northwest,” which is the silliest and most inefficient murder method ever attempted.
Was the pilot supposed to crash into Cary and kill himself too? Cut Cary’s head off with the propeller, which would make the plane stop flying? Or maybe force him to cough up a lung because of all the pesticide he was inhaling? None of these options seem practical.
Similarly, the whole chemtrails theory falls apart on practical questions. How often and how much do you need to spray those chemicals in the sky to affect everyone? There are 23 million people in Florida alone. That’s a lot of folks to spritz with your mind-control concoction.
Seems to me you’d need WAAAAAY more chemical spraying than what we’re seeing if you plan to coat every single one of us with the goop. You’d need to dump it out in quantities like the helicopter pilots dropping the contents of an entire pond on a wildfire.
Nope, what we’re seeing up in the sky are simple contrails — droplets of water vapor clinging to particles of soot that were emitted by an airplane’s engine.
So imagine my surprise when Rafe Pomerance of Rethink Energy Florida told me, “Water vapor is a greenhouse gas.”

“Say what now?” I replied, displaying my usual incisive intellect.
“You warm up the earth, and one of the effects is an increase of water vapor in the atmosphere,” he explained. Then the vapor traps heat in our atmosphere just like carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases do. The heat that created the vapor gets amplified by the vapor.
When I expressed that old healthy skepticism, he referred me to a scientist named Adam Boies of Stanford University. He’s an expert on contrails. He confirmed that chemtrails are bogus and also confirmed what Pomerance told me.

Some of the contrails disappear in minutes after the plane that created them leaves the area, Boies said. But some, say about 20%, linger longer. Those are the dangerous ones that can trap heat in the atmosphere.
Airplane engine manufacturers are worried about this so they are working on engine designs that will stop producing contrails, he said.
“The airlines are so concerned about this that they’re willing to try new fuels or rerouting flight patterns to try to avoid them,” Boies told me.
Thus, for once, the Legislature might do the right thing for the wrong reason — asking people to report something that actually is a cause of climate change. That’s why I think we should embrace this silly chemtrails bill and join DeSantis and Albritton in pushing it forward.
Then, once the bill passes, I say we all start contacting that DEP hotline to report, say, Florida Power & Light and its fellow utilities for burning fossil fuels to produce electricity. They’re building a lot of solar farms now, but they ought to replace their older plants too.
The same goes for all the municipal incinerators across the state, too, and the Big Sugar companies burning their fields and sending billows of thick smoke into the communities south of Lake Okeechobee. I say we report every one of these folks messing up our state.
“Hello, DEP,” we can say, “there’s a chemical plant in Pensacola that’s altering the weather with its nitrous oxide emissions. The clouds of pollutants are going up in the atmosphere and trapping heat here! You should do something about that, pronto.”
Or how about, “Hello, is this the DEP? I want to report someone for altering the weather. It’s the Florida DOT. They’re building a lot of roads for heavily polluting cars and trucks and doing nothing for mass transit. No electric vehicle charging stations, either. Can you get after them for that?”
By the way, I never did reach the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Garcia. It’s too bad. I was ready to congratulate her for doing more to combat climate change than either DeSantis or his predecessor, Rick Scott. Of course, to hear me speak, she’d first have to unwrap all that tinfoil from around her head.

Chung,,,,,https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/04/10/expanding-a-washington-tax-credit-could-be-a-prescription-to-help-lower-income-patients/,"People expect their doctors to give them vaccines, medications, or surgeries, but what do you prescribe when someone’s health problem is poverty?  In my 34 years as a pediatrician, many parents have told me: “You can’t help me with some of the problems that I have.” Many are single parents working two or three jobs [&#8230;]","(Photo by The Good Brigade/Getty Images)People expect their doctors to give them vaccines, medications, or surgeries, but what do you prescribe when someone’s health problem is poverty? 
In my 34 years as a pediatrician, many parents have told me: “You can’t help me with some of the problems that I have.” Many are single parents working two or three jobs to raise multiple children. How can I tell someone to buy more nutritious food when they already don’t eat so their children can?
As a clinician, it can be hard to talk to families about money, but people need access to tangible resources. For me, solutions like tax credits that put money directly into people’s hands make good sense. As tax day approaches, some of my patients will soon get a few thousand dollars back from the federal Earned Income Tax Credit and Washington’s Working Families Tax Credit. These resources make a big difference in people’s lives, and there is more that Washington state can do to help families that we see every day in our clinics and hospitals.
People in my field know that the Pacific Northwest has been a leader in public health. However, our tax code structure is incongruous with how progressive we have been in health policy. In Washington, people with the lowest incomes pay about three times more of their incomes in state taxes than the wealthiest do. This leaves families struggling to afford the basics and our public services chronically underfunded. 
Not only are tax credits one of the most important ways of righting our inequitable tax system, but they are also one of the most effective ways to help working people address their social needs. Unlike more conditional forms of aid, people have control over this money and can use it as they see fit — on groceries, rent, or book supplies for their children. More cash in people’s pockets means better health outcomes, better educational outcomes for children and teens, better maternal health outcomes, and less chronic illnesses down the line. 
So as families are doing their taxes, lawmakers in Olympia could consider ways to improve our state Working Families Tax Credit. They could raise the payment amounts, especially for single filers. They could switch to simpler or even automated payments, as only about half of families receive the money they are eligible for. And they could expand eligibility so that more people across the state can get cash back.
One proposed expansion would remove the age restriction that leaves out 100,000 young adults and seniors who live in poverty. Under the current rules, people without children must be 25 to 65 years old to claim their tax credit.
There’s a misconception among many well-to-do and educated people that young people rely on their families for support. However, one in 10 young adults experiences homelessness each year, and young adults face some of the highest rates of poverty in the US. Our foster care system also ends at 18. The lack of stability in these children’s lives has made it difficult for them to be independent at such a young age.
On the other side of the age spectrum, one in 10 of our seniors lives in poverty. That’s shameful for our country, the wealthiest in the world. A lot of grandparents who come through my office have stepped in to care for their grandchildren. The children are being raised by a grandparent who is often tired and may be dealing with their own health problems. Having already been through a lifetime of sacrifices, they often can’t afford the pair of soccer cleats or the after-school program that would help their grandchildren follow their dreams and build social skills.
If people are struggling to make ends meet day to day, they will have a hard time focusing on education, employment, and health. By expanding successful programs like the Working Families Tax Credit and raising progressive revenue, we can help people rise out of poverty. Poverty is not a fixed condition — it can be a temporary setback that we help people get through. With just a little effort, we can bridge the gap for our friends and neighbors.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pediatrician-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 07:03:48.943305

(Getty Images)The United States is in a behavioral health crisis, and Indiana is no exception. Millions of Americans struggle with mental illness and substance use disorders. Yet, too many lack access to the vital care necessary due to the extreme shortage of behavioral health beds. To remedy the situation and avoid further dire consequences, we must prioritize action to expand access to treatment.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) annual national survey paints a grim picture of mental health and substance use nationwide. The data reveals that 48 million people are battling a substance use disorder and almost 29 million struggle with alcohol use. The impact on young adults is also alarming — half of those aged 18 to 25 reported experiencing either a mental illness or substance use disorder.
‘We better get it right’: Health experts talk new funding, laws

These aren’t faceless figures. They’re our children, neighbors, and coworkers. In my time as Indiana’s Lieutenant Governor and in my own family, I have witnessed the heartbreaking struggle that lies behind these statistics. This drives my commitment to improving our health care system.
Indiana only has 11.9 psychiatric beds per 100,000 people, which is far below the recommended 50 beds per 100,000 necessary for adequate care. This means thousands of Hoosiers with severe mental illnesses are left without access to proper treatment, and health care providers are at risk of being overrun. In Marion County alone, 26,000 adults required but did not receive treatment for severe mental health conditions.
The consequences of this shortage are devastating. Individuals experiencing crisis who do not receive inpatient care often end up in emergency rooms where they can wait days or even weeks for a bed to open up. Others land in jails, where their conditions only worsen, or on the streets, where they struggle to survive without proper treatment.
As those in need of mental health treatment have struggled to access it, there have also been increasing suicide rates. According to the CDC, suicide was the second leading cause of death among people ages 10-14 and 25-34 in 2022. Overall, suicide rates have climbed 36% since 2000. Every statistic represents a life lost, a family shattered, and a community left to pick up the pieces.
Beyond the human toll, the economic cost of untreated mental illness is staggering. A 2023 study in JAMA Network found that Indiana lost $4.2 billion due to the effects of untreated mental health conditions. This includes lost productivity, emergency care costs, and the burden on the criminal justice system.
Caution on cuts
Amid the bed shortage, some federal and state policy makers have discussed reducing funding for Medicaid, the largest payer for behavioral health services. More responsible government spending is a laudable goal, but lawmakers should be careful and thoughtful about any reductions that could exacerbate the lack of behavioral health care coverage.
Indiana has the opportunity—and the responsibility—to take meaningful action. Expanding the number of behavioral health beds should be a top statewide priority.
Investing in more psychiatric beds is not just a moral obligation; it’s a practical necessity. When patients receive the right care in the right setting, it ultimately improves their chances of recovery and reduces strain on other public systems. States that have prioritized mental health care have seen significant reductions in ER visits, incarceration rates, and overall health care costs.
One increasingly common method to make more beds available is joint venture partnerships between hospitals and behavioral health care providers. This model makes it easier to expand treatment by both reducing financial commitments for hospitals and combining the specialized expertise of behavioral health care providers with hospitals’ established infrastructure.
Without offering adequate treatment capacity, more Hoosiers will suffer, more families will grieve, and more communities will bear the weight of untreated mental illness. Let’s commit to expanding treatment access to change the trajectory of this crisis and ensure a healthier and happier Indiana.

And the end of session is hands-down my least favorite.
That’s because for months, the General Assembly has chugged along at a reasonable pace, hearing bills, listening to Hoosiers, making changes, passing measures — even compromising a time or two.
And then we hit the final few weeks, and all best practices go out the door.
I’m going to lay out three examples we have seen in recent days that don’t bode well for a transparent and accountable legislature. It’s also why trust in public service continues to erode.
1 – The massive property tax measure. Senate Bill 1 went from 46 pages when introduced as Gov. Mike Braun’s reset plan helping homeowners. It grew under Senate Republicans to 91 pages. And after House Republicans added another amendment, it is a stunning 354 pages. The GOP folded in tangentially related and even unrelated bills (possibly to harvest votes). And it made the product so endlessly complicated that even someone who has covered Indiana’s property tax system since it was redesigned after being found unconstitutional is struggling to grasp it all.
It now includes a bill that had been moving just fine on its own – Senate Bill 518 – and looked like an easy win for the GOP. It provides property tax sharing in some local school districts for public charter schools. It’s a perfectly good debate to have but now the measure is in this will, which likely means Democrats won’t support it.
The newly amended version has long sought business tax break in a phaseout of the business personal property tax cut. This comes even though the purpose of the bill was long said to be about giving homeowners relief from massive assessment and bill spikes.
Oh yeah, and it also dissolves a school corporation in southern Indiana has almost all virtual students, which has nothing to do with the bill.
Heck, the bill isn’t even titled property tax relief anymore. It’s now local government finance.
2 – Reviving things that already failed once due to lack of support. In the first half of session House Bill 1662 had robust hearings, passed out of committee and then died on the calendar because it didn’t have the votes. The bill has been labeled by critics as criminalizing homelessness. Now at this late hour, it was suddenly put into Senate Bill 197 via an amendment. No one following the issue had notice of the amendment so there was no public testimony. And it is likely headed back to the Senate to see if they “concur” or accept that change. Mind you, senators haven’t heard one iota of testimony on the concept.
3 – Brand new language. We’re in the fourth month, and yet still putting in language that has never even passed a committee. Several bills filed at the outset were bans on advertising marijuana. But none of them passed a committee vote in the first half. So, instead, a Republican lawmaker added it to a BMV bill he authored while it was in a Senate committee. The agency was none too pleased, and the language was removed the next week. But never fear, the language was added again – this time to Senate Bill 73 on utility trailer sales. The language hasn’t passed a single chamber, and most lawmakers have heard no testimony on the pros and cons of such a move. But it would very well become law anyway.
Yes, the session isn’t over until the session is over. And every day counts. But leaders can’t be happy with some of the shenanigans that are just considered to be ho-hum legislating. For the majority of session, cooler heads prevail and then when the end nears everyone forgets that it matters just as much how a law is passed as what is passed.

The measure passed on a 70-27 vote along party lines. 
Braun made property taxes a cornerstone of his 2024 campaign, and had been conspicuously quiet after House leaders unveiled their plan Friday. 
“I am grateful for the leadership of (House) Speaker Todd Huston and (Senate) President Pro Tem Rod Bray and for the ways they have partnered with us to deliver this meaningful tax relief to Hoosiers,” Braun said in a statement shared to X. “I encourage House members to support this amendment and urge the Senate to then take action quickly to get it to my desk for signature.”

The new version of  Senate Bill 1 will increase a credit applied to all homeowner bills to 10% or a maximum of $300, cumulatively saving homeowners $1.4 billion over the next three years. An earlier version had a $200 cap and saved homeowners $1.1 billion over three years. Additionally, the amended property tax bill softens its business personal property tax cuts and further drops local income tax limits.
“This amendment makes a good bill even better and provides even more relief to homeowners,” said Lizton Republican Rep. Jeff Thompson, who authored the amendment. 
Thompson, who also sponsored the underlying Senate motion, said that two-thirds of homeowners will see reduced bills in 2026 when compared to 2025. 
But Democrats again urged caution when voting on the large bill without knowing the full fiscal impact. The Legislative Services Agency doesn’t release fiscal notes on amendments until they are adopted. 
“I just can’t vote on something that has so many uncertainties,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis. 
 Democratic pushback

A handful of Democrats spoke against the amended bill, many of whom mentioned the changes to the business personal property tax as a major concern. Currently, small businesses with less than $80,000 in such property — which can include equipment, billboards and more — are exempt.
Before Wednesday, Senate Bill 1 would have halted the charge on purchases after this year, meaning the revenue to municipalities would gradually fall.
A 2024 study from the Indiana Chamber found that exempting the tax on new business personal property would reduce revenue by $1.2 billion for the state while eliminating the depreciation floor would shave away another $35 million. 
In the amended property tax bill introduced on Wednesday, that $80,000 benchmark increases to $1 million next year and $2 million the year after.

“The government officials in our cities and towns (who) are going to be affected have not been in this conversation. There’s still concerns with what we have, even though this amendment does make a little bit better than what we had in committee,” said Rep. Mike Andrade, D-Munster. “… a lot of elected officials are concerned that they’re going to not be able to have this tool.”
House Speaker Todd Huston made a rare appeal from the floor, urging his colleagues to advance the motion to amend.
“This is historic taxpayer relief. Historic,” said the Fishers Republican. “… This is a complex system. We are making it a better, more transparent system for all — whether you’re a homeowner, a business or a farm. But we are, most of all, making it great for Hoosier families.”
After accepting Thompson’s edit, Republicans batted away over a dozen Democratic attempts to amend the bill, including ones that would grant more relief to renters, a first-time home buyer’s credit and one restricting the personal property tax language to only American corporations.
“The money is tight,” Thompson repeatedly told Democrats, referencing the state’s slim revenue growth predictions for the next two years. 
In a statement, House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta called Senate Bill 1 “a tax hike in disguise.”
“Paying up to 4.1% in income taxes to your city and county on top of state and federal taxes is much more than the $300 max in ‘credit’ you could receive off your property tax bill in 2026,” said GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne. “Businesses still get a break, but working Hoosiers get crumbs. This is a bad deal for working Hoosier families, which is why House Democrats voted no on this plan.”
The bill must pass through the House one more time before the Senate takes action. That chamber can opt to accept the amended property tax bill or dissent, which would go against Braun’s wishes for a quick resolution. 
Dissenting would send the bill back to a conference committee, where lawmakers would hammer out a final negotiation that both chambers could agree upon.

Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, speaks during House debate in March 2025 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).With less than six weeks left in the legislative session, Missouri House Republicans scrapped their latest of several iterations of an abortion ban in search of a new solution. 
The newest proposed constitutional amendment got its first committee hearing Wednesday night with a bill filed by Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis of Moberly presented to the House Children and Families Committee by its new handler, state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican.
Seitz told his colleagues the legislation, a response to Missouri becoming the first state to overturn an abortion ban, “will help foster a culture of life in Missouri, one that all our citizens can support.” 
The amended version of the bill, which passed out of committee after two hours of debate, was not yet available on the House website as of Wednesday evening. 
But Seitz in his presentation of the legislation said it was nearly identical to a bill passed out of the same committee in late March.
That legislation sought to outlaw abortion with exceptions for medical emergencies and fetal anomalies. It would also legalize abortions up to 12 weeks gestation for survivors of rape and incest, but only if first reported to police, a requirement that remains highly-criticized by survivors and their advocates.
The ballot language for the latest legislation was also not yet public Wednesday evening, but the bill it was based on was criticized for excluding any direct reference to an abortion ban. Instead it sought to ask if voters wanted to “guarantee access to care for medical emergencies, ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages,” a right that is already guaranteed in the Missouri Constitution. 
That amendment also would have asked if Missourians wanted to “ensure women’s safety during abortion,” “ensure parental consent for minors,” allow abortions for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, rape and incest” and “protect children from gender transitions.”
Seitz said while his morals don’t align with the rape and incest exception, he believes that adding the allowance up until the end of the first trimester would be more favorable for voters.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City and herself a sexual assault survivor, asked Seitz to imagine someone’s body being violated only to have a reminder of that violence through nine months of pregnancy.
 House Minority Leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City, surrounded by members of the Democratic caucus, speaks at news conference after the 2025 legislative session opened (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
“Could your child have cured cancer?” Seitz asked as the many in the crowd audibly groaned. 
Aune brushed aside his question, calling it “an insane hypothetical.” 
Seitz on multiple occasions said he believes the abortion-rights amendment — which was approved by voters and protects the procedure up until the point of fetal viability — actually legalized the procedure up until the moment of birth. 
Aune called his assertion a misrepresentation of the amendment, saying he wasn’t taking into consideration those diagnosed with “devastating fetal anomalies” late in pregnancy.
“If you think that there are abortions on demand at nine months, shame on you for thinking so little of women,” she said. 
State Rep. Ann Kelley, a Republican from Lamar, said she agreed with Seitz that the abortion-rights amendment’s language allowing abortion at any point if “needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person” was too ambiguous. 
Seitz questioned whether a person who is nine months pregnant could be “in very much pain, as I’m sure most women are when they’re about birth, and declare, ‘I want to have an abortion. I want to have an abortion. I just can’t take it. I cannot go through with it. I cannot have a baby. I cannot financially care for the baby. My boyfriend’s disappeared. I want an abortion.’ I think Amendment 3 opened that door to that possibility at nine months.” 
Up until this week, House Republicans had used a bill filed by state Rep. Melanie Stinnett as the vehicle for their proposed abortion ban amendment. After that legislation underwent three major revisions, including one that was not approved by the bill’s handler, it was seemingly scrapped before it got to the full House for a final vote. 
Seitz added Wednesday that unlike the last iteration of Stinnett’s bill, which sought to put stricter parameters on abortion, his legislation had the support of Missouri Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group. 
Susan Klein with Missouri Right to Life testified in support of the new legislation Wednesday, calling it a true effort to “repeal and replace Amendment 3.” 
In November, just shy of 52% of Missourians voted to legalize abortion up until the point of fetal viability through a citizen-led ballot initiative. 
Missouri anti-abortion elected officials have since vowed to either restrict or repeal the reproductive rights amendment, known as Amendment 3, arguing that Missourians didn’t understand what they were voting on when they checked “yes” at the ballot box. 
A flurry of legislation followed, much of which has been criticized as an attempt to overturn the will of the people and a waste of taxpayer’s time and money. 
But Republicans are adamant that an abortion ban would succeed on a statewide ballot. 
“When this legislation passes, we’ll know the will of the voters,” Seitz said Wednesday. “And it will pass.”
Despite abortion becoming legal nearly four months ago, only a handful of procedural abortions have been performed across three Planned Parenthood clinics in the state. 
The delay is in part due to multiple ongoing court cases around Amendment 3, including a lawsuit in which a judge in February agreed to strike down several of the state’s abortion regulations, citing them as “discriminatory” and allowing clinics to restart the procedure. But the judge kept in place a current regulation mandating that only physicians perform the procedure.
Medication abortions remain inaccessible.

Seitz said his amendment seeks to restore a number of these abortion regulations, adding that it would guarantee only licensed physicians be able to perform abortions. 
“We are not in a place and time where people are randomly hanging out a shingle,” said state Rep. Pattie Mansur, a Democrat from Kansas City.
“Not yet,” Seitz responded.
State Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka who chairs the committee, only permitted five people to testify in support and five in opposition on Wednesday, citing a hearing on abortion earlier this year that lasted four hours. The rest of those in attendance were permitted only to state their name and whether they were for or against the legislation. 
“While you have come this way, you do get to speak,” Jones said. “But we are not going to spend and belabor the points of either side all evening.”
After four people spoke in favor of the bill and more than 55 people voiced their opposition, Jones asked that the hearing room be cleared when Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, called the hearing a “sham,” criticizing Jones for limiting how many people were allowed time to testify and then led abortion-rights advocates in a chant. 
“I’ve been in this building five years. This is the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen,” state Rep. Rep. Marlene Terry, a Democrat from St. Louis, told Jones after she cleared the public out of the hearing. “ … This is their house. You had them put out of this room.” 
“The hell I need to take a vote,” Terry said as she left her seat before the hearing concluded. 
The amended version of the legislation passed out of committee 11 to 3.

But our early history shows what happens when justice is left to those acting outside the law. 
In the 1860s, before Montana was even a territory, rough mining camps like Bannack and Virginia City were plagued by theft and violence. With no real courts or law enforcement, desperate citizens turned to vigilante justice—self-appointed committees who held mock trials and issued swift punishments, often by hanging.
These Montana Vigilantes formed to bring order to chaos. Between 1863 and 1865, they hanged dozens of alleged criminals, including Bannack’s elected sheriff, Henry Plummer, who was suspected of leading a ruthless gang of road agents. While some say the vigilantes brought safety to the camps, they operated far beyond the boundaries of due process or constitutional rights.
That dramatic history serves as a cautionary tale. True justice requires more than good intentions—it requires a fair, impartial, and functioning judiciary whose orders are respected not only by the citizens but also by the other branches of government.  That is what separates a just society from mob rule.
Today, Montana’s legal system looks nothing like it did in the vigilante era. Judges are trained professionals, bound by the rule of law and guided by legal precedent. And while high-profile Supreme Court cases get the headlines, most justice in Montana happens quietly in small-town courthouses.
Last year nearly 57,000 new cases were filed in Montana’s district courts alone. Roughly 700 cases ever make it to the Montana Supreme Court. The rest are resolved by district and local judges—judges who help regular Montanans through real-life problems.
They preside over divorces and custody disputes, ensuring parenting plans are fair and that children are protected. They help sort out estates, wills, and inheritances after the death of a loved one. They settle property line disagreements and water rights claims that affect livelihoods. They resolve disputes between business partners and interpret contracts that went sideways. They even protect intellectual property like trademarks and patents that power small businesses and entrepreneurs.
In short, our judges aren’t just legal experts—they’re guides who help us resolve our most complicated and emotionally charged conflicts. Their work is the backbone of an orderly society.
But access to justice doesn’t just depend on laws—it depends on people. We need enough judges to handle the growing caseloads across the state. Unfortunately, some parts of Montana are struggling to keep up. Yellowstone County, in particular, has seen case numbers climb steadily, leading to delays that hurt families, businesses, and communities.
That’s why we supported Gov. Greg Gianforte’s budget proposal to add three new district court judges in Yellowstone County. 
This isn’t about helping lawyers—it’s about helping people. It’s about ensuring that regular Montanans can get their day in court without waiting months or years for resolution.
Because justice delayed is justice denied.
We’ve seen what happens when people feel like they can’t rely on the courts. As U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts noted in his 2024 year-end report on the federal judiciary, threats against federal judges have tripled in the last decade. And just last month in Helena, a woman was shot and killed after threatening courthouse staff and a judge. 
If we want to keep our state safe, fair, and free, we must protect our legal system. That means defending judicial independence. It means being informed about judicial elections. And it means recognizing that the law isn’t an abstract concept—it’s a promise. A promise that no matter who you are, where you live, or what you’re going through, you can resolve your dispute in a courtroom—not in the street.
We’ve come a long way from the vigilante days. Let’s make sure we never go back.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-2676-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-10 07:03:48.943305

The bill’s harshest critics argued it was nothing more than an attempt by the marijuana industry to stomp out its competition.  “It reminds me so much of a street drug [&#8230;],"Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, offers a floor substitute to his cannabis bill Wednesday, kicking off a lengthy debate of the legislation (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Legislation aiming to regulate intoxicating hemp products like Delta-8 seltzers and hemp-THC gummies stalled in the Missouri Senate on Wednesday after a seven-hour bipartisan filibuster.
The bill’s harshest critics argued it was nothing more than an attempt by the marijuana industry to stomp out its competition. 
“It reminds me so much of a street drug war,” said state Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis. “All drugs have always been about distribution and territory. And this is no different.”
This was the second year that May led bipartisan resistance to legislation that would ban intoxicating hemp edibles and vapes from being sold outside of marijuana dispensaries. 
The bill is backed by the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association and sponsored by Republican state Sen. Nick Schroer of Defiance, who has tried unsuccessfully to guide it through the legislative process the last two years. 
While marijuana products must be sold in dispensaries and be grown and manufactured in state-regulated facilities, intoxicating hemp products are completely unregulated by any governmental agency. They can come from other states and are not required to be tested, though many companies do post test results on their websites.
There’s no state or federal law saying teenagers or children can’t buy them or stores can’t sell them to minors, but some stores and vendors have taken it upon themselves to impose age restrictions of 21 and up. 
“This is not just a loophole,” Schroer said, “it is a public-health crisis.” 
The reason for the difference in treatment is that the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp. Several states have passed laws to prohibit intoxicating hemp products, and Missouri legislators have tried for the past two years to do that as well. 
They have been met with arguments that a ban would further entrench a “marijuana monopoly.”
This year, in an attempt to appease these concerns, Schroer agreed to amend his bill to carve out an exception for beverages, such as THC seltzers sold in cans. It capped the amount of THC at five milligrams per can and excluded drinks made with “synthetic” THC, or THC that has been converted from CBD using a chemical process.
However, May argued it doesn’t protect many other hemp businesses that don’t sell beverages and manufacture high-dose products to treat certain ailments. She proposed an amendment to create special licenses for hemp businesses that would be regulated through the same agency that oversees the state’s marijuana program, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. It failed 8-16.
 Sen. Karla May, a Democrat from St. Louis, debates a bill by Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, in the Missouri Senate Wednesday afternoon (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
May’s amendment came after the Missouri House spent many hours this year debating two bills backed by hemp industry leaders, which were both defeated in committee. Those bills established a similar regulatory framework as proposed by May.
Infighting among hemp leaders contributed to the bills’ demise. One of the bill sponsors, state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon, attempted to come up with a compromise among the splintered hemp industry leaders on regulations. He incorporated a number of the Missouri Hemp Association’s requests into an amended version of his bill. Not only did the association still reject his bill but the hemp beverage distributor that initially backed his bill called members of the committee to kill it before it went to a vote because he didn’t like the association’s additions.
Schroer said that marijuana products are sold in dispensaries to be “kept out of the hands of children,” and to ensure heavy metals, pesticides and other carcinogens aren’t contained in these products.
“If we’re going to have a regulated industry, implement consumer protections to make sure that the potency that’s on the packaging is exactly what it is,” he said. “The main point is making sure that our kids don’t have access to this stuff.”
The filibuster was supported by several Republican senators, including Sens. Mike Moon, Mary Elizabeth Coleman, Mike Cierpot and Curtis Trent.
Coleman said May’s amendment is “really reasonable.” 
“We’ve got to find a path for us to not continually pick winners and losers through the government, when we can’t protect our businesses through the marketplace,” Coleman said. “Increasingly, we see Republicans taking those positions, and I find it very troubling.”
Coleman and Cierpot held the floor for more than an hour and said they agreed children could be protected by requiring the products to be locked behind the counters at convenience stores. Cierpot called it a “turf war.”
“If you’re truly worried about kids and the way this stuff is sold,” he said, “the path forward is pretty clear.”
Just before 8 p.m., Schroer interrupted Cierpot talking about his crypto money investments to lay the bill over, ending the debate.

The Haitians were admitted to the U.S. through a humanitarian parole program in response to lawlessness and deadly violence in their homeland. The newcomers became part of the community, said immigration attorney Marc Chistopher, a New London resident [&#8230;]","Some of the 40 residents of New London who came out Wednesday morning to support migrants, many of whom work at Tyson Foods across the street from where they held a rally. (Photo by Jason Kerzinkski for the Wisconsin Examiner)In 2023 a group of Haitian immigrants began arriving in the central Wisconsin community of New London.
The Haitians were admitted to the U.S. through a humanitarian parole program in response to lawlessness and deadly violence in their homeland. The newcomers became part of the community, said immigration attorney Marc Chistopher, a New London resident whose law offices are in Appleton and Milwaukee.
“Their children go to school with our children,” Christopher told the Wisconsin Examiner Wednesday morning. “They worship in the same churches. They eat at the same restaurants. They join the same civic organizations. They’re in the gyms. They’re our friends, more importantly, and they’re our co-workers. So they’re a part of our community and part of our fabric and we welcome them.”
The legal refugee program through which they were admitted includes a work authorization. More than 100 of the new immigrants  ended up working at a Tyson Foods plant in New London, processing and packaging chicken. Others went to work at stores in the community or in other jobs.
In late March, however, the Trump administration told more than a half-million people from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela that they were no longer welcome. The order from the Department of Homeland Security, terminating humanitarian parole for about 532,000 refugees from the four nations, is one of a flurry of orders targeting millions of immigrants in the U.S. since President Donald Trump took office.
Haitians in New London were among those covered by the March 25 order. They were notified through an online account assigned to every  humanitarian parole refugee, Christopher said.
 “Your parole will terminate upon the earlier of (1) your original parole expiration date or (2) April 24, 2025,” states a Homeland Security message to one of Christopher’s clients, shared with the Wisconsin Examiner. “You should depart the United States now, but no later than the date of the termination of your parole. Failure to timely depart may have adverse immigration consequences.”
Since the notices arrived, Christopher has been scrambling, trying to help a handful of people who hope they might qualify to stay in the U.S. Other New London residents have been organizing on behalf of their new Haitian neighbors. 
On Wednesday morning Christopher and his wife, Eloise DeLeon, also an immigration attorney,  joined about 40 residents of New London gathered across the street from the local Tyson plant, carrying signs advertising their support for the Haitian workers there and hoping to send a message to the community.
“The message is intended for everyone,” said one participant, Sue Krejcarek. “There are people who maybe were Republicans, voted Republican, but don’t agree with this. It’s OK to protest against things you don’t agree with, whether you voted Republican, Democrat. When something is wrong, you stand up for it.”

Emily Tseffos helped organize  the demonstration along with a group of New London activists.
“These folks have established life here because they were expecting to be able to stay here,” Tseffos said. “They came here through legal means. And they are working and paying taxes and they are going to schools and they are dreaming of starting businesses.”
School officials have been working closely with the Haitian families, Tseffos said, and teachers who have the children of Haitian parents in their  classrooms participated in the Wednesday morning rally. Community volunteers have been offering financial help with bills and groceries as the immigrant families grapple with the sudden command to go or face deportation.
“They were not planning on having 30 days notice to leave,” Tseffos said. “And so it’s really sad to see that these folks that are doing everything right and everything they’re supposed to be doing are now facing deportation in a couple weeks here.”
In addition to the notification from the federal government, Tyson plant employees who were permitted to work under the humanitarian parole program have received letters from the company telling them that their employment authorization will expire April 23 — the day before their deadline to leave the U.S.
Christopher said that he has sought to put together applications for a small number of people for whom he could make a case for asylum.
“An asylum claim is one of the more difficult and time-consuming things I do as an attorney,” he said. Asylum claims are decided on a case-by-case basis and require extensive factual details. Claims perceived as frivolous can meet with severe penalties.
An asylum applicant cannot get a work authorization for six months, however, Christopher said. That means even if the application is granted, “if they lose their work on April 24, those families have no means for supporting themselves,” he said.
Both DeLeon and Christopher are former prosecutors, and DeLeon is a former municipal judge. “So I understand the rule of law, following rules, right?” DeLeon said. “But this [following rules] is what our clients did.”
Christopher remains outraged at the way his neighbors’ lives have been overturned. “They’ve been promised they could stay here,” he said. “They came through legally, and they’ve been vetted.”
To be suddenly ejected “is not good for them,” Christopher said. “And it’s not good for our community, either.”

<p>CHICAGO — On a warm Tuesday evening in late June 2019, state Sen. Emil Jones III walked out onto the patio at a suburban steakhouse and into an hourslong dinner that would set the table for alleged bribes — and subsequent federal corruption charges.</p>
<p>Jones, D-Chicago, dressed in a polo shirt that matched the orange rind in one of his dinner companion’s condensation-glazed cocktails, had been asked to the meal by his colleague, state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, in order to broker an understanding with Omar Maani, the co-founder of a Chicago-based red-light camera company.</p>
<p>In three of the General Assembly’s previous four legislative sessions, Jones had proposed measures that Maani and his company, SafeSpeed, viewed as an existential threat to the red-light camera industry. But only one had ever gotten even partially through the legislative process, thanks to Sandoval’s tight control over the Senate Transportation Committee, which he chaired.</p>
<p>“He won’t let my bill even see the light of day,” Jones joked as all three of them laughed. “S---, Marty. I thought you loved me, Marty.”</p>
<p>Maani had just finished explaining that he and Sandoval had been friends for about a decade and were “about as close as people can get.” A few minutes later, Sandoval extended Jones an invitation into that relationship.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“I’m glad you came, Emil,” Sandoval said. “Omar wants to be your friend.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But Maani, who had been bribing Sandoval for years, was motivated by something other than friendship — or even protecting his business. The red-light camera entrepreneur was acting under instructions from the FBI, with whom he’d been cooperating since agents knocked on his door one early morning in January 2018.</p>
<p>Jones and Sandoval were two of “dozens and dozens and dozens” of others Maani secretly recorded for the feds’ investigation, he told a federal jury Wednesday as Jones’ corruption trial kicked off at the federal courthouse in Chicago.</p>
<p>A few weeks after that June 2019 dinner, Maani and Jones met up alone for a meal at one of the senator’s favorite spots: Steak 48 in Chicago’s swanky River North neighborhood. Jones mentioned that he’d previously held a campaign fundraiser at the restaurant, and Maani picked up the conversational thread from the previous meeting, asking about Jones’ next fundraiser. It happened to be scheduled for the following month.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“So let me ask you this: In an ideal world, how much would you want me to come up with or raise or what have you for it?” Maani asked, pausing briefly to order another drink.  “You tell me a number.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“I don’t give folks numbers,” Jones said after a beat. “Just whatever you can raise for me, that’d be nice. I’m not greedy.”</p>
<p>But Maani pressed him, and after a complimentary detour in which the senator told Maani he was “a good guy” and that he enjoyed his company, Jones gave him a goal.</p>
<p>“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” the senator said.</p>
<p>“Done,” Maani replied.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, the jury of five men and seven women were told that Jones never actually received the $5,000 from Maani.</p>
<p>“That’s because FBI agents went to interview the defendant instead,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri said during his brief opening statements. “But the crime here is the agreement.”</p>
<p>Immediately after Maani agreed to raise $5,000 for Jones, the senator raised another request.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office,” Jones told Maani. “And I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Maani quickly agreed to find something for the engineering major, asking Jones to have a resume sent over and musing that maybe the intern could be made a “reviewer” at SafeSpeed, a job Maani explained to the jury Wednesday as the person who reviews red-light camera footage to determine whether a driver committed a traffic violation. Reviewers don’t have final say in municipalities outside of Chicago; a local police department does.</p>
<p>But Jones’ former intern, who is expected to testify Thursday, was never made a reviewer. Instead, Maani began paying him the suggested $15 an hour for 20 hours per week even though he didn’t have any work for the intern to do. After six weeks, the payments stopped when the FBI made Maani’s cooperation known when agents interviewed Jones the same day Sandoval and others were publicly raided in September 2019.</p>
<p>Kolluri accused Jones of engaging in “politics for profit” and promised the jury they’d ""get to hear the defendant’s lies straight from his mouth,” as one of the three charges Jones faces is for allegedly lying to the FBI about his agreements with Maani.</p>
<p>But Jones’ defense team spent their short openings previewing how they planned to go after Maani, with attorney Joshua Adams telling the jury that the FBI mole was a “serial briber” who got an extraordinary deal from the feds.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna hear him testify about all the bribes he made, all the lies he told and the lengths he went to conceal those bribes,” Adams said.</p>
<p>Maani’s bribery charge was dismissed in 2023 — the year after Jones himself was charged, but four years after Sandoval and other local elected officials caught up in the red-light camera probe were indicted. Sandoval died in late 2020 after pleading guilty to his charges. Jones is the only figure to take his case to trial, as the others also pleaded guilty.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Maani told the jury how he developed a friendship with Sandoval “because we needed his support in the legislature,” adding that Sandoval “held a lot of sway” not only in the legislature but also within the Illinois Department of Transportation, which regulates red-light cameras.</p>
<p>Maani said he began giving Sandoval “personal benefits” not long after they’d first met, including cigars and cigar labels.</p>
<p>In the June 25, 2019, recording, Sandoval told Jones that Maani had thrown a bachelor party for the senator’s son at a suburban cigar club, but Jones said he’d recently quit smoking when offered a cigar. Sandoval also joked to Maani that he and Jones were “both brought up by the same daddy,” referring to Jones’ father, former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr.</p>
<p>Jones Jr., who was sitting in the courtroom Wednesday, listened as Maani claimed that when Sandoval said on the recording that the former Senate president taught him “the craft” of politics, it meant “accepting personal benefits.”</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“We took him out to dinner all the time,” Maani told the jury Wednesday when describing what he did for Sandoval. “Gave him campaign contributions, but like I said we tried to conceal it with different companies we control.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam who Maani was referring to as “we,” Maani said it was SafeSpeed, though in his secret recordings, Maani emphasized that he was acting alone.</p>
<p>SafeSpeed, which in 2023 changed its name to AllTech Tracking and sued Maani for reputational harm, said in a statement Wednesday that it was “deeply offended to see that Omar Maani, despite admitting to criminal acts, is now refusing to accept responsibility for his own criminal conduct” and accused Maani of making “false claims about SafeSpeed” on the witness stand.</p>
<p>“We want to be absolutely clear Omar Maani has not been affiliated with the company since February 2020 and we stand by our original statement: Our company was unaware of any illegal activities Omar Maani may have engaged in,” AllTech said, adding that Maani “was a rogue employee.”</p>
<p>Maani explained to the jury that he and SafeSpeed viewed that Jones’ 2019 bill, which called for a statewide study on red-light cameras, was viewed as a “prelude to a ban” on such technology. Maani hoped he could at least persuade Jones to amend his bill to call for a study only in the city of Chicago, where SafeSpeed didn’t operate.</p>
<p>In recordings the jury will hear Thursday, Jones allegedly agreed to limit his legislation in exchange for the $5,000 and the job for his intern, according to the feds.</p>

In the June 25, 2019, recording, Sandoval told Jones that Maani had thrown a bachelor party for the senator’s son at a suburban cigar club, but Jones said he’d recently quit smoking when offered a cigar. Sandoval also joked to Maani that he and Jones were “both brought up by the same daddy,” referring to Jones’ father, former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr.

Jones Jr., who was sitting in the courtroom Wednesday, listened as Maani claimed that when Sandoval said on the recording that the former Senate president taught him “the craft” of politics, it meant “accepting personal benefits.”

“We took him out to dinner all the time,” Maani told the jury Wednesday when describing what he did for Sandoval. “Gave him campaign contributions, but like I said we tried to conceal it with different companies we control.”

Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam who Maani was referring to as “we,” Maani said it was SafeSpeed, though in his secret recordings, Maani emphasized that he was acting alone.

SafeSpeed, which in 2023 changed its name to AllTech Tracking and sued Maani for reputational harm, said in a statement Wednesday that it was “deeply offended to see that Omar Maani, despite admitting to criminal acts, is now refusing to accept responsibility for his own criminal conduct” and accused Maani of making “false claims about SafeSpeed” on the witness stand.

“We want to be absolutely clear Omar Maani has not been affiliated with the company since February 2020 and we stand by our original statement: Our company was unaware of any illegal activities Omar Maani may have engaged in,” AllTech said, adding that Maani “was a rogue employee.”

Maani explained to the jury that he and SafeSpeed viewed that Jones’ 2019 bill, which called for a statewide study on red-light cameras, was viewed as a “prelude to a ban” on such technology. Maani hoped he could at least persuade Jones to amend his bill to call for a study only in the city of Chicago, where SafeSpeed didn’t operate.

In recordings the jury will hear Thursday, Jones allegedly agreed to limit his legislation in exchange for the $5,000 and the job for his intern, according to the feds.

But that effort has been expanding in recent years.
In 2021, the Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 73, which requires uniform accounting, budgeting and financial reporting procedures for Idaho cities, counties and urban renewal districts. That information has been added to Transparent Idaho, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In October, the Sun reported financial data for 198 Idaho cities is now available on Transparent Idaho. 
“We’ve had state data for 10-plus years, but our vision has always been to have local governments on Transparent Idaho as well,” Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf said in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon.

The Idaho State Controller’s Office announced the latest Transparent Idaho addition on Monday — the posting of new education financial data. 
The new education data includes detailed enrollment figures for schools and districts, workforce salary data and transactions made by education providers, such as school districts and public charter schools.
Woolf said publishing the data isn’t meant to serve as a “gotcha” to public school districts and charter schools. Instead, Woolf said publishing the data can build trust with Idahoans and encourage the public to become informed and engaged with its government and the decisions policymakers set. 
“The public being able to track and trace and understand where the taxpayers’ money is being spent can go a long way to helping set the right types of policy and making good policy decisions,” Woolf said.

The education data is already publicly available. School districts are required by law to post it on their own websites, and Idaho Education News has been publishing enrollment, salary data, test scores, per-pupil expenditures, higher education go-on rates and more on its education data site for years. 
But publishing the education data on Transparent Idaho means the state government is now publishing education transparency data for public schools, districts and public charters schools in one spot, alongside other financial transparency data related to state government, cities and counties.  
Transparent Idaho only publishes data about schools, districts and charter schools that receive public funding. Data for private schools, homeschool programs and other private education choice programs do not appear on Transparent Idaho, the Idaho State Controller’s Office said in a press release issued Monday.
Moving forward, Woolf said he will work on adding additional demographic information and data visualization tools to Transparent Idaho — with an eye toward allowing the public to have more data to make apples-to-apples comparisons between schools and districts. 
All of the new education data is available free online at https://transparent.idaho.gov.

Language mandating Indiana’s sex education instruction to include a presentation on “human growth and development during pregnancy” was officially baked into Senate Bill 442 on Wednesday.

The add-in was approved along party lines by the House Education Committee, as was the underlying bill, which now heads to the chamber floor.
Terre Haute Democrat Rep. Tonya Pfaff emphasized that the bill “is not needed at all.”
“We already have a class on child development, which goes into a lot of detail on how a baby is grown during the nine months of pregnancy,” Pfaff said. “I just don’t like this idea of mandating that kids have to watch this. I would prefer that — if they’re interested in this — watch it with their parents.”
Pfaff further questioned how the ultrasound video would be selected. Republican Rep. Julie McGuire, who proposed the language, said decisions would be left to local boards.
“I found 16 videos in about 10 minutes on YouTube,” said McGuire, of Indianapolis. “There’s so much material out there. It doesn’t have to be that prescriptive.”
Changes to sex ed instruction
At its core, Senate Bill 442 seeks to require any instruction and learning materials used to teach “human sexuality” for grades 4-12 be approved by a school board.
Basic information about the curriculum would have to be published in a “conspicuous” place on the school’s website. That includes a list of classes, by grade level, “in which any instruction concerning human sexuality will be taught,’ and whether that  instruction “will be provided by a male or female instructor.”
The school’s parental consent form — which lets parents remove their children from sexual education classes — would also need a link to that information. A grievance procedure would additionally need to be in place for parents to call out non-compliant schools.
Critics of the bill have repeatedly noted, however, that Indiana parents already have the right to remove their child from sex education classes. And some schools don’t provide such classes at all.


The House Education Committee also adopted a proposal that intends to increase transportation and facility sharing between Indianapolis Public Schools and area charters. Despite discussion earlier in the session to approve a statewide plan to boost resource sharing between traditional publics and charter schools, lawmakers kept language in Senate Bill 373 limited to just Indianapolis. The latest draft of the legislation moved to the chamber floor on Wednesday in a 9-3 vote.


The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course in schools. Instead, it only mandates that schools teach lessons on HIV and AIDS. Schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
Currently, school boards have the authority to review and approve curricular materials. State law further requires school corporations to make instructional materials available to parents so that they can consent to instruction on human sexuality.
But bill author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, questioned if school boards “are actually having conversations” about that curriculum. He previously said the proposal stemmed from concerns brought to him by teachers and parents, and that his intention is to “help parents better decide whether they want to opt their child out” of sex ed courses.
Byrne introduced a similar bill in 2024 that advanced from the Senate but died in the House without a committee hearing.
The ultrasound provision would require students to view a “high-definition ultrasound video,” at least three minutes long, “showing the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other vital organs in early fetal development;” as well as a “high-quality computer-generated rendering or animation” showing “the process of fertilization and each stage of fetal development inside the uterus, noting significant markers in cell growth and organ development for every week of pregnancy from fertilization to birth.”
Like Pfaff, Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, maintained that “I don’t think we should be doing this.”
“I thought we were having legislation on human sexuality and the training of human sexuality — not lessons on maternity or chordate anatomy, which seems to be what this is,” he said. “I think this opens this bill up to a serious discussion on the (House) floor about education and videos about STDs and everything else that in any way is related to sex.”
Other bills on the move
In a separate move, House lawmakers abandoned contentious language that could have increased permissions for high school students to leave school for religious instruction.
Sen. Spencer Deery, R-West Lafayette, framed his Senate Bill 255 as a means to tighten up existing law by preventing public high school students from missing large amounts of time from one class for out-of-school faith-based lessons.
Hoosier students are already permitted to miss up to 120 minutes of class each week for optional religious instruction hosted off school grounds.
Lawmakers debate if students should miss some — or all — of a class for religious instruction

Deery’s bill suggested a tweak, however, to allow older students to effectively replace an elective course with religious instruction. The existing two-hour limit for elementary and middle school students would remain the same. 
The proposal was criticized by House Democrats, who questioned how an increased exemption for religious instruction would benefit students. They emphasized, too, that Deery’s proposed changes could permit daily absences and more than double the amount of time that can be spent away from traditional classes.
Although the bill advanced to the House floor last month, committee chairman Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, said the religious instruction language was found to be nongermane — too irrelevant — to the underlying bill, which mainly deals with teacher transition programs. 
The committee sent the bill back to the chamber on Wednesday with the provision on religious instruction gone entirely.
Tensions also rose over a bill that would require Indiana’s Commission for Higher Education (CHE) to have a heavier hand in higher education programming and decision-making.
Under Senate Bill 448, which advanced to the House floor along party lines, CHE would have to review all public college and university degree programs — currently there are more than 3,000 — at least once every 10 years. 
When doing so, the commission would have to consider factors like labor markets, job placement, stackable credentials and work-based learning to determine if a degree should continue to be offered.

Among the bill’s other provisions is another requirement for university boards of trustees to “assess and review the staffing needs” of the school during tenure reviews, which would then have to be shared with CHE. 
“What I want to make sure is that we’re being smart as we’re educating and developing the workforce, and to make sure that we put Indiana first — while at the same time — continue to be a magnet for individuals from outside of Indiana,” said bill author Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute.
Indiana Higher Education Commissioner Chris Lowery was on board, but Democrats were not.
They worried, for example, that CHE would have “too much power” to approve or disapprove university programs and faculty. Concerns were also raised over academic freedom implications that could come from potentially limiting programs that aren’t directly tied to workforce needs.
DeLaney repeatedly argued that the bill transforms CHE’s relationship with universities, from a collaborative partner to a mandate-driven authority.
“For those who want to be really nervous, you pass this, and the gentleman down the hall — the lieutenant governor — becomes the governor, and who does he put in charge the Commission on Higher Education? And how much power do we want that person to have?” DeLaney said. “That’s what the stakes are here. This is about taking a cooperative system, that’s evolved over decades and has succeeded, and making it a mandate-from-above system.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The effects of a second failed referendum at Dodgeville School District became immediately apparent this week with the district announcing that 13 staff members along with some programs, including electives and extracurriculars, are to be cut. The April referendum failed last week by 109 votes with 2010 people voting against and 1,901 for.
Ainsley Anderson, a social studies teacher at the middle school, and Ian Sullivan, a third grade teacher at the elementary school, said they heard concerns from voters about there not being an end date to the referendum. 
The school district’s request was for a $2.49 million recurring referendum, meaning it would allow a permanent increase to the amount the district can raise through property taxes annually. It was going to be used for operating costs, filling a gap between the district’s revenue and expenses. The annual cost of the request was more modest than the district’s nonrecurring request in November, which would have allowed an increase of $2.99 million annually for four years, but failed by 113 votes.
“People are scared right now with the economy and everything,” Sullivan said. “It’s a very interesting stock market, and… I mean, eggs are $8.”
The educators said they knew the cuts were a possibility if the referendum failed. 
“The administration and the school board have been very clear… it wasn’t a shock that this was going to happen,” Anderson said. 
“It’s difficult,” Sullivan said. “There’s a lot of emotion, even with it being communicated well to us.” 
“You never want to hear about your colleagues losing their job,” Anderson added. 
The pair of educators met Tuesday with about 10 Democratic lawmakers, including members of the Joint Finance Committee, and about 20 other community members, including parents and school board members, at a community center in Dodgeville. They discussed the situation and the potential for lawmakers to act in the state budget to ease the financial challenges the district and others across the state are facing.
Dodgeville’s situation is a familiar story in Wisconsin as school districts have been relying on property tax hikes that need to be approved by voters for everyday costs while state funding has not kept pace with inflation for the last decade and a half.
“We know that so many families have been forced to raise their own property taxes in order to support their public schools, and that’s a difficult choice,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said at the start of the event. 
Democratic lawmakers used the event as a moment to highlight Gov. Tony Evers’ plan for helping school districts escape this trap. His plan would tap the state’s $4 billion budget surplus to increase special education funding by reimbursing public schools for 60% of costs — almost double the current reimbursement rate of 32%, to increase per pupil funding and to invest in other programs, including free school meals and mental health programs. 
Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) emphasized that lawmakers wanted to hear about people’s specific stories as a way to help inform their work on the budget committee.
“We know how many referendums there are. We know that some succeed and some fail,” Andraca said. In April, voters approved 52 referendum requests for a total of $952 million in new money for Wisconsin school districts that is funded through property taxes. There were 37 failed referendum requests, including Dodgeville’s. “We want to know the impacts that it’s having with you and your families and your schools on the ground,” Andraca added, “because that’s what makes our work more meaningful.” 
At a table with McGuire, a couple of parents spoke about their concerns about the ways the district will change.
Jennifer Williamson said she has two children in the school district and they’ve appreciated the small class sizes of between 14 and 18 children. Those class sizes on average will grow by four to five students due to financial constraints.
Stephany Marten told the table that she and her husband debated over whether to send their child to the local school district or to a local private school. They decided on Dodgeville. She said she learned more about the district and what it had to offer, including smaller class sizes, reading specialists and opportunities for students that need additional support. 
“It’s accessible and it’s affordable to all families,” Marten said. “Our public school funding is being cut. What are we spending it on?”
McGuire, throughout the conversation, emphasized people should reach their Republican lawmakers. The Democrats brought their conversion about education funding to a school district and area of the state represented by Rep. Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) — cochair of the powerful Joint Finance Committee.
Republicans hold the majority in the state Senate and Assembly and Marklein has served as cochair on the committee since 2021, meaning he plays a large part in shaping the budget bill that will eventually be sent to Evers if approved by the full Legislature. Marklein said at a recent public hearing on the budget that lawmakers haven’t discussed specifics on education funding in the budget, but will likely take into account what the public shares.
“Your state senator, Howard Marklein, has a tremendous amount of influence,” McGuire said. “So we have to continue to reach out to him.” He added that people should speak with their neighbors as well to encourage them to reach out to the lawmakers.
One person asked McGuire what is keeping Republicans from dedicating more funding to schools.
“I wish I knew,” McGuire said. “If I knew what levers to pull, I would’ve done it four years ago.”
The impacts of the failed referendum in Dodgeville could likely go beyond those announced by the school district administration, Anderson noted. Some staff will say, ”I can’t work with the district that has two failed referendums because of pay cuts, health care,”  he suggested, adding, “We’ve lost people to going elsewhere.”
The Dodgeville educators also participated in a conversation with Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee), Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) and Rep. Andrew Hysell (D-Sun Prairie).

Another educator at the table, Tom Butusov, formerly taught at the Dodgeville School District but left for a job at Mount Horeb Area School District — a community about a 20-minute drive away — about three years ago.
“When I got a job teaching in Dodgeville, I was very excited,” Butusov, who taught at the district for about three years, said. He grew up in the community and his mom also taught in the district. “But I learned pretty early on that because of just what the district can offer… I had to go elsewhere to best serve my family,” Butusov said. He said Mt. Horeb could pay more and it was close to a new house his family was purchasing. “It made sense, but I still love this community.” 
Butusov said the failed referendum is “heartbreaking.” He said he doesn’t blame the community because they’re being asked to pay for something they’ve already paid for and he isn’t mad at the district because he feels the state has put the district in the spot. 
“We have an entire district that’s falling through the crack and the state is doing nothing — nothing for us, and that’s what’s so frustrating is to see representatives that just aren’t doing anything,” Butusov said.
Anderson and Sullivan, who are also co-presidents of the Dodgeville teacher’s union, have children who go to the district as well. Anderson said she knows that even as budgets have shrunk, teachers are still working to provide a high quality education to students and are going to continue to work to do that even as some opportunities may be cut.
Sullivan said he and his wife have had discussions about whether they’ll leave the district. 
“We’re getting rid of field trips. We’re getting rid of after school clubs, opportunities at the high school and stuff. Do we want that for our kids?” Sullivan said. He added that the community is a big reason he was there and that it is “fighting to get more funding and give more opportunities not only to our own kids,” but to other students, especially those dealing with poverty and other challenges at home. 
Anderson said she would love to have a conversation with “Mr. Marklein and Mr. Novak about what they envision as the future of education in their districts.” She said she was feeling inspired to contact the local lawmakers and to encourage other members of the Dodgeville education association to do the same.
“Obviously, we’re doing everything that we can,” Anderson said. “What are they doing?” 
Sullivan said that he appreciated hearing specific budget plans from Democrats.
“I have not heard that from the other side. I would love that opportunity to hear it,” Sullivan said. “At the moment, I’m only hearing one side. The other is just saying no to everything, which I don’t think is OK.”

He’s just not letting it drown his optimism. 
  Jeffrey A. Mandell
“I don’t think any of us fully anticipated how heavy, broad, fast and extreme the onslaught was going to be,” Jeff Mandell concedes, referring to President Donald Trump’s moves to seize unprecedented power, weaponize the federal government against his political enemies, defy court orders, deport people without due process and throw the entire global economy into chaos.
“Some of what we are seeing and hearing is so contrary to our most fundamental understanding of what we believe about our government, I have to believe this is temporary and that people won’t stand for it,” Mandell says.
Since its founding in October 2020, Law Forward has pursued high-profile lawsuits that have helped claw back democracy in Wisconsin. The firm challenged the state’s now-defunct gerrymandered voting maps and uncovered the details of the fake electors scheme that originated here — forcing the Republican officials who posed as members of the Electoral College and cast fraudulent votes for Trump in 2020 to admit they were trying to subvert the will of the voters. On the public website it created to display the details of the scheme, which it obtained as a condition of a settlement, Law Forward stated that it wanted to show “how close our democracy came to toppling and how the freedom to vote must continue to be protected, not taken for granted.”
This week, Law Forward’s grievance against former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman for misconduct in his ill-conceived “investigation” of voter fraud in the 2020 election led to the suspension of Gableman’s law license.
As a Wisconsin-based organization, Mandell says Law Forward looks for opportunities to pursue cases that are of particular importance to the state and that shine a light on threats to democracy.
“The rest of the time we don’t sit in paralysis because of the news,” he adds. Whatever fresh hell is erupting across the country, “we continue to work here so people see an alternative.” 
“I think building a stronger, more resilient democracy in Wisconsin is its own form of resistance,” he adds.
“When things feel most shocking and unstable at the federal level,” at the state and local level, Mandell says, “we can show our institutions still work and provide some reassurance.” 
Even before Susan Crawford defeated Brad Schimel last week in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race — despite the heavy-handed intervention of Trump and Elon Musk — Mandell was feeling hopeful. He felt Wisconsin showed a “silver lining” after the November 2024 election, despite Trump’s narrow win in the state.

Among his reasons for optimism: New, fair voting maps that replaced the old Republican gerrymander, creating a more balanced Legislature; a governor who supports voting rights and democratic institutions; extraordinarily high voter engagement, with Wisconsinites turning out in bigger numbers than in other states in 2024 and overwhelmingly rejecting the MAGA-backed Supreme Court candidate in 2025. 
With Crawford’s win, “Wisconsin will continue to be a place where we can rely on the courts to protect our fundamental freedoms,” Mandell says.

The 10-point margin in last week’s election also “reinforces my conviction that the majority of Wisconsinites really do believe in democracy,” Mandell says.
All of those things position Wisconsin to be a leader in the struggle to protect democracy from the Trump onslaught.
Wisconsin’s long march to recovery from misrule by Gov. Scott Walker and the rightwing billionaires who backed him has been taking us in the opposite direction from the rest of the country.
Along with his union-busting Act 10 — challenged by Law Forward and soon to be taken up by the Wisconsin Supreme Court — Walker took a sledgehammer to funding for public education, long before Trump and Musk arrived with their chainsaws. Voters here have been pushing back against the billionaire-financed destruction of civil society for more than a decade. Recently, they’ve been gaining traction. Law Forward has played an important role in that fight.
And it’s not over. Mandell has hope not just that Democrats will pick up more seats in the state Legislature as the un-gerrymandered maps go into full effect next year, but that our closely divided state will maintain its longstanding independence and commitment to bipartisan institutions. He draws encouragement from the fact that Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee are holding budget hearings around the state, even as Republicans in Washington ram through a budget based on Trump’s demands, ignoring the public and ceding their power as members of Congress.
Wisconsin’s long tradition of good government includes a host of bipartisan commissions, a decentralized elections system that is hard to hack and a great university that has managed to survive waves of attacks by McCarthyites and budget cutters for 176 years.
That tradition extends to a bipartisan nominating commission for federal judges, which ought to choose a replacement for 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Sykes, who announced in March that she is taking semi-retirement. Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s office reports it has been in contact with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s office to reconstitute the charter for the bipartisan nominating commission, as they have done in every Congress under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Trump could still ignore the process and nominate someone on his own. But three weeks after Sykes’ announcement, he hasn’t done it yet.
If Trump wrecks the economy and steers the whole country into a recession, Wisconsin won’t be spared. Nor can we avoid all the shocks of a national authoritarian regime. But our state’s independent democratic institutions leave us well situated to recover, and to help the rest of the country remember what civil society looks like.
“There is no one silver bullet,” says Mandell. “But the goal is to continue to tend the lamp here in Wisconsin, to shine a light that illuminates the path to balance, order and democracy.”

Sen. Charlaine Oliver of Nashville cited Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s history of involvement in Republican-led challenges to legal protections for women, transgender individuals and against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
Skrmetti has led or joined lawsuits that include a challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s rule prohibiting discrimination against women seeking abortions, litigation seeking to stop transgender medical care for minors and sent letters to corporations warning them against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among other actions.
“How can pregnant women trust the attorney general’s office will defend their right to fair employment given it has previously taken action to restrict their ability to seek relief,” Oliver said during a meeting of the Senate Government Operations Committee. 
Bill to abolish Tennessee Human Rights Commission advances

“He has not proven to be an unbiased independent agency or appointee,” she said. “We clearly see that. This is a massive expansion of the attorney general’s responsibilities.”
Republican Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon, cosponsor of the legislation, noted that different divisions of the Attorney General’s office would operate independently of one another.  
Stevens’ proposed legislation (SB861/HB910) would dissolve the Tennessee Human Rights Commission by July 1, and transfer its responsibilities and 30 employees to a newly-created Civil Rights Enforcement Division within the Office of Attorney General. Rep. Johnny Garrett, a Goodlettsville Republican, is a cosponsor of the legislation. 
The 60-year-old commission is a nonpartisan and independent agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodation – and discrimination claims against the state of Tennessee.  
Should the bill become law, about 1,000 pending discrimination complaints before the commission would be dismissed, forcing the individuals who brought them — and the employers and institutions who have spent time and money defending themselves — to start anew, Muriel Malone Nolen, the commission’s current executive director, has said.
The bill also includes proposed changes to Tennessee anti-discrimination laws related to schools, creating a pathway for those denied admission or participation in campus activities on the basis of “race, color or national origin” to file civil rights complaints with the attorney general – a provision widely understood to give white students a basis to file claims against educational institutions that have diversity, equity and inclusion policies.
Bill to abolish discrimination watchdog agency advances in Tennessee Legislature

 
The commission has come under legislative scrutiny in recent years over internal turmoil. 
Last year, a vice chair resigned after being accused of disparaging remarks about LGBTQ individuals and ethnic communities.
In 2022, allegations of a toxic and abusive workplace forced then-Human Rights Commission executive director Beverly Watts to step down. Watts has denied the allegations.
The nine-member Human Rights Commission has been operating with just five members in recent years, in part because Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton – who is responsible for the appointment of three of its members –  has failed to add new members.

Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture


The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.

Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Jeff Landry speaks to reporters about his legislative agenda to bring down high auto insurance rates on April 9, 2025. (Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry unveiled his legislative agenda Wednesday to target Louisiana’s high automobile insurance rates, leaning on some familiar issues that lawmakers have considered in previous years.
The governor summarized a vast legislative agenda that includes proposals to limit lawyer advertising, limit the damages that can be recovered in personal-injury cases and bring transparency to the way car insurance companies set their premium rates. 
Lawmakers have tried numerous times to address the auto insurance crisis, passing legislation based on the testimony of researchers, insurance industry representatives, truck drivers, business owners, lawyers and others. Most of that legislation has taken aim at a legal environment in Louisiana that critics say makes it easy to file bodily injury lawsuits for quick monetary settlements that aren’t always warranted.
At a State Capitol news conference Wednesday, Landy sought to distance his effort from that previous approach. 
“We passed dozens of bills that we were told were going to lead to lower rates … yet we stand here today seeing very little improvement,” the governor said.
Gov. Landry signs Temple-backed insurance package

Landry described his agenda as a “balanced” approach that would regulate both sides of a long-running debate that has pitted insurance companies against the trial lawyers who often sue them.
One proposal with the potential to spur significant changes has to do with the rate algorithms insurers use to determine how much to charge a particular driver for coverage. 
Landry wants to reveal the different variables that go into these calculations and how they’re weighted. Currently, insurance companies get to hide their rate formulas by labeling them “proprietary,” which treats them as trade secrets and prevents consumers and regulators from knowing how the rates are calculated. It has essentially created a guessing game in which drivers and lawmakers can never truly know which factors cause premium spikes. 
Landry said it’s time to “demand transparency” from insurers, but he did not say whether that window should be opened to the general public. The state insurance commissioner should at least be able to see the rate algorithm, the governor said.
The commissioner should also have the authority to prohibit any rates deemed “excessive,” Landry added, noting that peers in other states do. In Louisiana, the insurance commissioner reviews auto rates to ensure insurers are in compliance with certain general rules, but he can’t force companies to lower premiums solely because they’re considered too high.
Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, who did not attend the governor’s press conference, is holding a separate conference Thursday morning to unveil his own legislative priorities. His absence has raised questions about whether the two elected leaders, both Republicans, are in agreement on the issues. 
When asked about it, Landry said he didn’t know why Temple was holding his own conference and referred further questions to the commissioner’s office, which was similarly vague about the situation. 
“Tim is glad the governor is engaged on the issue,” Department of Insurance spokesman John Ford said. “He will have a lot of info tomorrow on his plans for [the legislative] session.”
The governor’s agenda also includes efforts to address personal injury lawsuits in the state, which some have blamed as the cause of expensive auto insurance. He wants lawmakers to eliminate the Housley presumption, which is a standard of evidence the Louisiana Supreme Court created for auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits in a precedent-setting 1991 case, Housley v. Cerise. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Landry said he wants to “rein in” the heavy amounts of advertising by trial lawyers and prohibit insurance companies from factoring advertising expenses into their policy rates. 
Temple leans on data to explain high La. auto insurance rates, but plaintiffs’ lawyers don’t buy it

“I’m just as tired of seeing Morris Bart as I am of seeing the lizard,” the governor said, referencing the ubiquitous New Orleans trial lawyer and Geico’s spokesreptile.
Previous attempts to limit lawyer advertising in Louisiana have run up against the First Amendment, but Landry said he believes his proposal should pass constitutional muster. 
The governor additionally wants to require insurers to offer 5% rate discounts on policies for commercial trucks outfitted with dashboard cameras. He also wants to prohibit the use of a driver’s credit score as an excuse to increase their rates, among other proposals.
The governor said he is tailoring his agenda to follow the data on every possible cause of the high rate crisis, adding that he is “tired of the lies” that have prevented meaningful change in the past. 
The most recent figures from the Insurance Information Institute placed Louisiana at second in the nation for the highest average auto coverage at $1,558 a year in 2022. It trailed only Florida ($1,625) and was barely ahead of New York ($1,549).

The agency [&#8230;]","Flood waters in East Tennessee. (Photo: Brandon Hull/Office of the Governor)Tennessee’s workplace safety agency concluded that an East Tennessee plastics plant where five employees died after being swept away by Hurricane Helene floodwaters “exercised reasonable diligence” in dismissing employees that day.
The Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration (TOSHA) issued its report on the Impact Plastics plant in Erwin, Tennessee on April 2. The agency found that because work had stopped and employees left the building, “the tragic deaths of the Impact Plastics employees were not work-related and therefore do not fall within its jurisdiction.”
The agency did not issue any citations.
The inspection report comes as the family of Johnny Peterson, one of the employees killed in the Sept. 27 flood, moves forward with a lawsuit against the company. The suit alleges that Impact Plastics did not release employees with enough time to escape the rising water.
“TOSHA’s report ignores multiple witnesses’ testimonies, critical text messages, emergency alert logs, and photographic evidence that tell the real story about Impact Plastics’ fatal failures,” Zack Lawson, an attorney representing Peterson’s family in the lawsuit against the company, stated. “We’re grateful that in America, juries — not bureaucrats citing unnamed sources — will decide the truth based on all the evidence.”
Impact Plastics has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and issued a statement on April 2 welcoming TOSHA’s findings.
“These past months, Impact Plastics and its President and Founder Gerald O’Connor have cooperated with the official agencies investigating the flood and events of that day. The facts and the truth are now known,” an attorney representing Impact Plastics stated.
Internal review from plastics plant where three died finds ‘there was time to escape’ flood

Peterson, four other Impact Plastics employees and one independent contractor were swept away after the semi-trailer truck bed they sought refuge in was toppled by rushing water and debris. Five other employees who were swept into the water were later rescued by helicopter about half a mile downstream.
Investigation details difficulties, offers recommendations
TOSHA’s investigation included site visits, witness interviews, review of surveillance footage and collaboration with law enforcement. The report notes that Impact Plastics’ workplace safety records were destroyed or lost in the flood, and “phone service disruptions, language barriers and other challenges” made communication with witnesses difficult.
The investigation report laid out a timeline of that morning. The National Weather Service released its first flash flood warning alert for Unicoi County at 9:14 a.m., during the company’s morning meeting. Employees were told by managers or other employees to move their vehicles to higher ground between 10 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., when water began to fill the parking lot, the report states. 
The site, which lies in a flood plain, lost power at 10:39 a.m. By 10:51 a.m., “employees were reportedly told they could leave, although accounts of this directive varied,” according to the report.
Body of last Impact Plastics worker found month after Helene

The ongoing lawsuit against Impact Plastics contests this timeline, citing text messages sent by Peterson to his family before his death. A message to Peterson’s daughter indicated senior management had not dismissed employees by 10:51 a.m. Employees realized they were trapped around 11:12 a.m., according to a text Peterson sent to his father. Peterson understood employees were dismissed only after senior management exited the property around 11:35 a.m., the lawsuit states.
While most employees evacuated, some remained or returned to South Industrial Drive, according to the TOSHA report. “Witnesses and evacuated employees could not clearly explain” why some people did not leave, but the report noted that some witnesses said they were afraid to drive through floodwater, they felt unable to leave by vehicle or on foot, or they believed that the flooding would not worsen. 
TOSHA found “no evidence that employees were threatened with termination or forced to work beyond a safe evacuation point.”
While TOSHA does not have a rule requiring employers to develop site-specific severe weather emergency plans, the agency did recommend that Impact Plastics create one and train employees and managers on evacuation during different types of severe weather.

A rainbow sheen spreads across puddles beneath empty duck blinds and stains the dozen white, donut-shaped absorbent pads left behind to soak up the mess.

The leak – significant, yet small by Louisiana standards – has highlighted concerns about the state’s response to such leaks under the Trump administration and Gov. Jeff Landry.

Landry has overseen the reorganization of various state agencies, including last year’s transfer of the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office (LOSCO), previously under the Department of Environmental Quality, to the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources. The governor’s choice to lead LDENR, Tyler Gray, was previously director of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, a 102-year-old industry group.  
While the Trump administration seeks to roll back regulations around oil and gas infrastructure, some are worried it will reduce Louisiana’s already insufficient spill response.
“I’ve been flying there for years, and I’ve never seen that much oil spilled at that site,” said David Levy, an Iberia Parish resident who first noticed the Weeks Island spill from his personal aircraft. From 2021-23, he was a member of the Oilfield Site Restoration Commission, a 10-member panel of governor’s appointees that oversees and prioritizes the state’s work to clean and clear old drilling locations. 
The spill occurred on in an area of the island ringed with oil wells and boreholes that surround the Morton Salt mine. The Texas Petroleum Investment Co. first reported the spill to the U.S. Coast Guard on March 2, saying it was the result of a leak in a saltwater injection liner used to keep corrosive fluids away from one of its boreholes. Three barrels of crude oil had been spilled, according to the Coast Guard report, though Levy estimates it was four or five.
Even five barrels, or 200 gallons of oil, is not a hugely notable spill in Louisiana, which sees large leaks regularly. But it is still significant. Anything over 5 gallons must be reported to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

On April 1, a month after the spill occurred, oil was still visible at the site. It shimmered atop the water in the tidal marsh alongside the Intracoastal Waterway. The oil was mixed with charred material from a controlled burn apparently conducted as part of the cleanup. Among blooming purple thistle, contractors left behind two propane-fueled devices for incinerating the oil. Past the shoreline, crabbers headed for Vermilion Bay.
The Weeks Island site is among nine areas in coastal Iberia and Vermilion parishes the LDEQ has deemed “sensitive sites.”
This is not the first time Texas Petroleum Investment Co. polluted the area through improper operations. The EPA fined the company $599,700 last year for unauthorized emissions and Clean Air Act violations at Weeks Island.
The problem this time, Levy said, is that spill response workers “went out there, threw some absorbent pads around and did nothing.” 
The insufficient cleanup is reflective of a decline in enforcement around spills and leaks, according to Levy. 
“Christ, they should’ve gotten vacuum boats or something to go pick the oil up,” he said. “They’re waiting for the rainwater to wash it into Vermilion Bay,” a popular spot for fishing and crabbing.
Several crabbers working at the marina closest to the spill said they sometimes see oil in the water. They worry about it affecting their catch but said they don’t know who to call about a spill if they wanted to report it.
Even if the fishers did report leaks, it wouldn’t make a difference, Levy said. 
“I don’t report anymore,” he said. “There’s no point.”
How spills are reported
Typically, when an oil spill occurs in Louisiana, the entity that caused or noticed the spill must notify the Coast Guard and Louisiana State Police. The troopers’ Hazardous Materials Unit then relays the information to LOSCO, which coordinates local response efforts with other state and federal agencies. 
The party found responsible for a spill has to pay for its cleanup and any mitigation to contain damages. They can theoretically face fines from the EPA or the state. In Louisiana, however, those fines are rarely enforced.
The LDEQ, which works with State Police and the Coast Guard on frontline response, has seen major upheaval since Landry took office. The governor appointed former Trump administration official Aurelia Giacometto as LDEQ secretary. Multiple senior staffers have left amid a wave of resignations, while employees in a recent survey reported poor morale and a toxic work environment. The complaints included being forced to disregard regulations.
Scott Eustis, a policy director with nonprofit Healthy Gulf, also worries about LDEQ’s history of lax enforcement. He pointed to the agency’s opposition to a 2023 air monitoring bill in the state legislature and its failure to address a noxious-smelling orphan well in Plaquemines Parish. Emissions from the well set off Healthy Gulf’s meter that measures explosive gases in the air, he said 
Meanwhile, the state Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office has its own staffing issues. According to an LDENR budget request document, eight of the office’s 21 permanent positions were vacant as of October. LDENR spokesman Patrick Courreges confirmed those positions were open before the request was made – and remain unfilled.   
More reorganization at LDENR will likely occur later this year, Courreges said. The changes are intended to make it easier for workers to collaborate, and the agency will use more technology to address spills. For example, the department has a Strategic Online Natural Resources Information System (SONRIS) that shows well locations but was “never really leveraged as a tool to improve enforcement,” according to Courreges.
President Trump, meanwhile, has aimed to roll back regulations and permitting rules in order to hasten pipeline construction. On his first day in office, he issued an executive order that called for “unleashing energy dominance.” It asked directors of his National Economic Council and the White House Office of Legislative Affairs to prepare recommendations to Congress that would facilitate the construction of energy infrastructure like pipelines.

Underreported and understaffed
There are about 1,000 oil spills in Louisiana each year, more than any other state, according to a 2019 analysis from ProPublica, The Advocate and The Times-Picayune. There’s also a backlog of at least 18 significant spills from before Katrina that still have outstanding natural resource damage assessments.
LOSCO’s online spill database shows only five incidents this year, including two attributed to the Texas Petroleum Investment Co (TPIC). The online database is not comprehensive, however. Public records Healthy Gulf obtained and shared with the Illuminator show 48 spills through March 1. The most recent spill, also by TPIC, occurred Feb. 21 in Plaquemines Parish.
According to Healthy Gulf’s review of those records, less than 4% of spills reported to LOSCO receive natural resource damage assessments. Of the 3,600 spills reported since 1992, TPIC and another company, HillCorp, are responsible for the largest number of the significant spills, per Healthy Gulf.
TPIC did not respond to a request for comment on this report.
Courreges said LOSCO did respond to the Weeks Island spill, but “we just don’t have the kind of staff” needed to update the website.
Eustis said LOSCO is already “bare bones,” and Louisiana officials haven’t taken steps to bolster its efforts. For example, the state has not followed a recommendation regulatory consultant Dwight Dunk made after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill regarding consistent fines for smaller spills. The legislature would have to put such fines in place. 
Eustis also worries Landry will follow in the footsteps of former Gov. Bobby Jindal, who laid off thousands of state employees during his tenure. Those could potentially include personnel who monitor and respond to oil spills. 
“My fear about the reorganization is that’s going to happen again, even though we have such a backlog of damage assessment and a steady occurrence of new oil spills,” Eustis said.

Bill, chief of police for the Lac du Flambeau (LDF) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, said his department and other agencies had spent over 1,000 hours in the search for Melissa Beson, 37, a tribal member who has been missing since March 17.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
As the snow melts under rising temperatures, the plan for Saturday, April 12, is to continue an organized ground, air and water search in and around the surrounding vast forest, thousands of acres where one could quickly become lost.
Beson was last seen between 4:30 and 5 p.m. on March 17 on the outskirts of the Town of Lac du Flambeau, by Indian Village Road and Chequamegon Forest Trail, near the Bear River.
Early in the search, the LDF Tribal Police Department flew a drone over the river’s open water and sent a submersible drone under the ice.
A search of the area forest, which covers most of Vilas County, was impeded by  snow cover.
After Beson was last seen on March 17, there was a heavy snowfall of over 6 inches, and then after her family reported her missing on March 23, another 3-inch snowfall covered the area. Some of the snow has melted with rising temperatures, but deeper in the woods snow is still covering downed logs and branches, making it difficult to detect what could be on the forest floor.
“We still have 6 inches of snow in the woods,” said Bill on April 8.
However, Bill anticipated that much of that snow would be melted by Saturday. Once the snow is totally off the ground, he plans to request that the Wisconsin State Patrol search the area by airplane.

On the previous Saturday, April 5, 25 people went out looking for Beson, including those from canine units and others operating drones in the water and air. However, it was difficult with the snow still on the ground.
On Tuesday, Bill was driving on a side road when he came across   LDF Emergency Manager Kat Milton, who was out collecting the GIS coordinates to help organize the Saturday, April 12, search in one of the large sections of woods near where Beson was last seen.
Bill’s concern about covering a large forest is volunteers getting lost while searching for Beson.
On Saturday, he also anticipates needing the drones to look over bogs and swamps scattered around the forest.
“We can’t walk into a bog unless we throw boards down that we can walk over,” he said.
Bill said he has to consider that Beson could have gotten lost in the large forest.
Since joining the department in 2013, he has participated in three searches for lost persons who were found deceased. The missing person is not always found deep in the woods.
“The Newbold Search and Rescue found one individual a half-mile from his residence,” he said.
Surveillance footage

After Benson went missing, the LDF Police Department reviewed recordings from over 360 surveillance cameras located around the reservation but didn’t turn up any footage of Beson.
“We didn’t have any surveillance cameras where Mellisa was last seen,” said Bill.
But the police department has other cameras that record the license plates of vehicles on the roads on March 17.
“We recorded the license plates of hundreds of vehicles,” he said.
Looking at all leads
As Bill’s office prepares for the weekend ground search, it is also coordinating with law enforcement in other areas of the state on leads that Beson might be living with friends off the reservation in larger communities.
“We are following up all the information we have, but we are also searching locally to eliminate the possibility that she might have walked off into the woods and gotten lost,” he said.

Beson’s mother, Winifred Ann Beson, “Winnie,” said her daughter might be with friends, but she also said she is afraid Melissa might have been taken by human trafficking. Native American populations have been targeted by human traffickers who prey on vulnerable populations where there is poverty and high drug use.
Winnie said her daughter likes to travel to other states, but she has always stayed in communication.
“Usually, she calls me if she needs money or is in trouble, but she hasn’t called me,” she said.
The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women/Relatives MMIW/R movement has been raising awareness of the plight of Indigenous women who have a much higher rate of being victims of violence.
The MMIW/R issue has touched the LDF band. On the edge of the Town of Lac du Flambeau, there is a new billboard asking for information on the death of Susan Poupart, a tribal woman who was murdered on May 20, 1990, and her case remains unsolved.

Winnie, who suffers from lung cancer, said it is difficult for her emotionally to not know where her daughter is or if she is safe.
“It’s hard,” Winnie said of her missing daughter. “She is big-hearted, loveable, funny. She is right by me all the time. Me and her are close.”



Melissa Beson is 5’7” with a medium build, brown hair, and brown eyes. She has numerous tattoos, including on her neck, arms and legs.
Anyone with information on  Beson’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 558-7717 or the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.
Anyone with information on the Susan Poupart case is asked to call Deputy Cody Remick at (715) 479-4441 or (800) 479-4441 or the Wisconsin Department of Justice at (608) 266-1221.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Last month, after receiving notice that Maine was in violation of federal law for allowing transgender girls to play on girls’ sports teams, the Maine Attorney General’s Office pushed back on federal findings, questioning both the process and the conclusion of the investigation. 
But according to records obtained through a Freedom of Access Act request, the office also pointed federal officials to two proposed bills — LD 233 and LD 868 — that would ban trans athletes. Whether these bills will alter the course of the investigation is unknown, but one thing is clear: the federal government is now paying attention to these proposals. 
“We have reviewed the proposed legislation at LD 233 and LD 868 that your team sent on Wednesday,” wrote Daniel Shieh, Associate Deputy Director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights in an email on March 17.
“We are not prepared to stay the investigation at this time, but please let us know if those bills become law in Maine.”
The two bills are among several proposals introduced this session by Republican lawmakers aimed at restricting transgender students’ participation in school sports. Neither has had a public hearing yet. 
LD 233, sponsored by Rep. Katrina Smith of Palermo, would require student-athletes to participate in sports based on their “biological sex” and would prohibit transgender girls from joining girls’ teams in public schools. LD 868, introduced by Rep. David Haggan of Hampden, is similar in scope, reinforcing gender-based athletic categories and citing competitive fairness and safety.
Republican lawmakers have urged Maine to comply with federal directives and walk back support of trans students’ rights to athletics, locker rooms and bathrooms.
“This is not sustainable,” said Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) in a press conference on April 1. “We’re a poor state. We are heavily reliant on federal money. The governor needs to move on this.”
The legal argument against the HHS findings
In February, after an investigation that took a handful of days and concluded without any interviews, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights determined that Maine had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination, and infringed upon the rights of cisgender girls by allowing trans girls to participate in girls sports. It held the Maine Department of Education for the violations, demanding the state change its policies. HHS claimed that the state department of education, by way of its relationship to the Maine Principal’s Association and its receipt of federal funds, had violated Title IX.
But the Attorney General’s Office rejected the claim, arguing in a letter sent on March 4 that the federal government had overstepped its authority and mischaracterized the facts. In the letter, Assistant Attorney Generals Sarah Forster and Kimberly Patwardhan wrote that the February 21 notice from HHS “did not specify how OCR planned to conduct its compliance review,” or explain what legal framework it would be based on, nor did it include attempts to discuss findings with the department or attorney general’s office, or to reach a cooperative agreement
“No one from OCR contacted MDOE or the Maine OAG for further information or to discuss cooperation or compliance,” the letter stated, calling the entire process “accelerated” and legally questionable.
The letter also rejected the federal government’s core argument — that the state department of education is responsible for policies governing high school athletics, which is overseen by the Maine Principal’s Association. The attorneys stressed that the organization is a private, nonprofit corporation, not a state agency, and is neither created nor operated by the department. 
“MDOE does not agree that it is in violation of Title IX, nor does it agree that OCR has laid out a sufficient factual or legal basis for such a determination,” Forster and Patwardhan wrote.
Further undermining the federal claims, the letter pointed out factual inaccuracies in HHS’s findings. One of the core justifications for the compliance review was that MDOE allegedly received more than $500,000 in federal assistance from the Administration for Community Living in 2024. However, that funding had already been transferred to the University of Maine at Augusta with approval from the federal agency in March 2024 — nearly a year before the review. “There is a significant inaccuracy,” the attorneys wrote, attaching documentation to prove the transfer of funding.
Shieh wrote back the next day with an amended compliance review notice, this time including the Principal’s Association and Greely High School, where a trans athlete who competed on a girls team attends school.
“Although Maine claims ‘MDOE is not responsible for interscholastic youth sports or athletic programs in Maine,’ it distributes funds for staff salaries, school facilities, and transportation, which in turn support athletics and interscholastic competition,” the letter said. “The fact that MDOE has ceded control over its activities to MPA does not limit its obligations under Title IX.”
On March 12, HHS appears to have met with all three organizations based on the emails, and five days later, the agency sent the attorney general’s office an amended determination, holding the department, the high school and the association in violation of Title IX, because they uphold the Maine Human Rights Act, which protects trans students by including gender identity among the list of protected classes. 
“When a state law, such as Section 4601 of Maine’s Human Rights Act, frustrates Congress’s purpose and poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of those purposes, that state law is preempted,” the letter said.
Rep. Michael Soboleski (R- Phillips) said he is introducing a bill to remove consideration of gender identity from the act, and asked Democrats and Mills to support the legislation in order to avoid the risk of losing federal funding.
“The problem is that the term gender identity and the Human Rights Act is being interpreted way too broadly by the left,” Stewart said in the press conference. “And what it’s saying is there’s no boundary between men’s and women’s spaces.”

Power Plant, although across the river, can be seen from many houses in downtown Poca, W.Va. (Dian Ray for West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia governor and lawmakers want to put coal and natural gas power plants in your backyards.
They want to rob local governments of their funding to do it. 
And they want to expose you to air, water and even noise pollution in the process.
This week, the Senate is moving on a Gov. Patrick Morrisey-backed bill to provide sweetheart deals to data center companies at the expense of everyone else. House Bill 2014 would allow data centers to apply for a special status from the West Virginia Department of Commerce that will exempt them from local government regulations. 
I wrote back in January about how the state is not ready for data centers, and this legislation makes what I said then even more relevant today. Data centers use a lot of power, whether from their own onsite microgrid, which this legislation encourages (but doesn’t require) or connecting to what we consider to be the normal grid. 
The bill was up for debate in Tuesday’s Senate Economic Development Committee. County commissioners testified about the bill’s harmful economic impact, which I’ll get to later. But West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton was called to speak about what he perceives as the bill’s positive impacts on coal. He mentioned that he believes the bill will lead to “modular coal plants” taking language from the nuclear industry’s hope in small modular reactors. 
To take language from the Coal Association: I have some pixie dust to sell them if they think tech companies like Google will invest in unproven technology like modular coal plants, as the industry has been on the decline because of cheap natural gas. 
Again, I’ll mention here that West Virginia’s power bills are high in part because the state clings to coal power while other states have embraced gas and renewable energy. Even one of our utility companies has said it expects to convert coal plants to natural gas. Of course, the Legislature wants to make that harder. 
Ignoring the fact that modular coal plants aren’t really a thing, the intention remains that supporters of the bill want these data centers, and the fossil fuel companies are hungry for the associated microgrids that they’ll bring. The bill exempts data centers and their microgrids from any local government regulations and removes the opportunity for all of us residents of our respective towns to provide any input on permitting or siting. 
Close to an elementary school? Too bad. 
Do you like getting your food fresh from a local farm? I hope you don’t mind that it’s next to a natural gas or even a coal plant.
What about that view of the mountains? It’ll look nice if you don’t mind the smoke stacks. 
I’m not creating an example out of thin air. Just last month, someone applied to build a natural gas facility in Tucker County near Davis and Thomas. The application doesn’t say that it will power a data center, but I trust that you can read between the lines. The permit says it won’t connect to the grid and would instead provide power to users onsite. The company name is Fundamental Data. 
This gas plant and data center will be just a couple of miles from the nearest school and homes. It’s also just a couple miles from the small, but vibrant towns of Davis and Thomas, national tourist destinations. Are gas plant microgrids and data centers what they need there? 
If the governor gets what he wants, local governments may not have a say in decisions like that. 
Data centers also use hundreds of thousands or even millions of gallons of water a day. The governor explicitly mentions water when he says West Virginia’s natural resources will power data centers. I ask: whose water? Why would we give Amazon, Google, Facebook or any other tech company unfettered access to our groundwater that many West Virginians depend on for drinking water? West Virginians in Southern West Virginia and across the state have been asking for clean water for as long as we can remember. 
In another example of attempting to extract our state’s resources for profit, a water bottling plant in Jefferson County was recently rejected because of local zoning and heavy public opposition. This bill takes away those opportunities to protect the water in your community from data centers.
Some local governments have spoken out about the loss of local control. They’ve also been vocal about the loss of tax revenue if this bill passes. The West Virginia Center of Budget and Policy published a post this week, but I’ll summarize it here. Under this bill, counties would be better off if any industry other than a data center bought and built a facility on a piece of land within the country boundary. That’s because once a data center is built, the tax revenue would almost entirely go to the state coffers. 
In the new Davis and Thomas data center example, Tucker County could lose nearly $8 million in tax revenue if the land was used for a data center rather than almost anything else. That revenue still exists. It just doesn’t go to the local government, local emergency services, local police or local schools. Instead, it would go to a new “Personal Income Tax Reduction Fund” and “Electric Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.” 
Read another way: the local school revenue would go to eliminating income tax for the wealthy. WVCBP has written previously that income tax cuts provide minimal benefits to people who make less than $65,000 annually. Meanwhile, people at the top benefit the most. This bill wants to take local school revenue to pay for tax cuts for the richest people in our state. 
The other new fund purports to address grid stability, and its proponents say it will keep the state’s electric bills low. But it’s important to point out that this is a subsidy—a handout to bail out our utilities’ coal power plants that simply can’t compete on the free market. It could possibly reduce the amount of future bill increases due to expensive coal-fired power, if enough revenue is successfully stolen from local governments, but it will not reduce bills. 
The data center bill contains other provisions that encourage utilities to double down on coal. That’s in line with other bills this session that seek a coal “renaissance” and make it more difficult for utilities to shift to a source other than coal, even if it were more cost-effective to do so. It seems our elected officials are intent on mandating coal use, no matter the fiscal or environmental cost to West Virginians, all to ensure that coal barons can continue to profit. 
It’s hard to wrap our heads around everything that is happening at the state and federal level these days. But here’s what I can say.
Our Republican-dominated Legislature and our Republican governor want to rob local governments of their tax revenue that funds their courts, police, EMS, firefighters and schools. They want to take away the chance for anyone to say this might not belong here, or this thing might make too much noise for someone to sleep at night. And they want to give tax cuts to the wealthy, and sweetheart deals to billion-dollar companies to do that. 
That doesn’t sound like small government for the people to me.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)At the beginning of this century Kentucky and other states that relied on burning coal for electricity enjoyed an economic edge, but competition from cheaper energy sources has dulled that edge. 
On Tuesday, some prominent Kentuckians looked on as President Donald Trump  signed executive orders aimed at reviving demand for coal. Coal company executive Joe Craft, a Republican megadonor, and Senate President Robert Stivers were in the East Room for the signing ceremony. And one of the orders Trump signed resembles a 2023 Kentucky law making it harder for utilities to retire coal-fired power plants, reports the nonprofit newsroom NOTUS. 
Trump promised in his first term to bring back coal. Whether the president’s actions this time can reverse energy market trends that have spurred the coal industry’s decline  — and at what cost to consumers — remains to be seen. The question is important in Kentucky not just because it’s a coal-producing state but also because cheap power has been one of Kentucky’s top economic advantages.
In the last 25 years, however, Kentucky has fallen from producing the country’s cheapest power to the 12th cheapest. It’s a gradual trend of rising electricity costs that some experts say is likely to continue unless the state diversifies its power sources beyond coal.
Kentucky had the cheapest power. Not anymore.
In 2001, Kentucky generated about 95% of its electricity from coal. Other coal-reliant states that year including Indiana, West Virginia and Wyoming were also among the top 10 states boasting the cheapest electricity.
Coal was relatively cheap then, and the state’s power plants that burned coal were “largely paid for,” according to a former spokesperson for Kentucky’s utility regulator. 
“It was a window in time when coal had some substantial advantages over other types of fuel,” said Andrew Melnykovych, who served as the public information officer for the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) from 2002 to 2020. 
But a continued reliance on coal to supply aging power plants is driving up the cost of Kentucky’s electricity, according to those who study the energy industry. That trend could impact the state’s ability to attract economic development as well as increase the burden on Kentuckians trying to pay their utility bills. 
According to the federal Energy Information Administration (EIA) as of 2023, Kentucky’s average cost of electricity across industrial, commercial and residential ratepayers (9.96 cents per kilowatt-hour) is still significantly cheaper than the national average (12.63 cents per kilowatt-hour) but has fallen to the 12th cheapest state in the country.
“For decades, Kentucky had an economic advantage of building coal power plants and burning that coal and producing cheap electricity here. That economic advantage has been eroded,” said Kent Chandler, the former chair of the PSC and a resident senior fellow for energy and environmental policy at the think tank R Street Institute. 

Chandler said more factors than fuel source and power plant expenses account for the cost of electricity. Still, the trendline of increasing electricity costs could continue if Kentucky continues to rely on aging coal-fired power plants.
Kentucky generated about 68% of its electricity through coal in 2023, the third-highest percentage of power sourced from coal of all states that year. 
Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in a statement last month said Kentucky families “enjoy some of the most competitive utility prices” because of the state’s “diverse energy landscape.” Hartman noted Kentucky has the lowest electricity costs east of the Mississippi River. 
Yet Frank Jemley, the executive director of the Kentucky Manufacturers Association, told the Lantern the state’s rising electricity costs are very concerning because the cost of electricity is a key component of job growth. 
Energy-intensive industries ranging from aluminum smelters to data centers boosting artificial intelligence services look at the cost of electricity when deciding where to expand because higher costs eat into a company’s bottom line. A state report from 2012 found low electricity costs had made Kentucky the single most energy-intensive economy of any state.  
Century Aluminum, which idled its aluminum smelter in Hawesville in 2022, told the Wall Street Journal last year it had no plans to restart its smelter because electricity prices in Kentucky were too high. Century Aluminum is also looking to build a new aluminum smelter with federal support, eyeing Kentucky as a potential landing spot. 
“There is a clear perception in the marketplace that Kentucky has lost its long-standing position as one of the best states for low-cost energy,” Jemley said.  “We’re convinced Kentucky must build a strategy to reestablish our top-five ranking as a low-cost, reliable energy state.” 
Some coal-reliant states have increasingly diversified. Kentucky, not as much
How did Kentucky lose an economic edge in the electricity marketplace? One reason is other states have adapted to a transitioning energy market while Kentucky has remained more static, according to those who focus on energy and utility policy at the Energy and Policy Institute, Energy Innovation Policy and Technology and the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. 
“Mainly, it’s a story of other technologies becoming cheaper over the last couple decades,” said Noah Kaufman, a senior research scholar and economist with the policy center at Columbia University.

The boom of hydraulic fracking in the 2010s to reach supplies of natural gas in shale deposits significantly boosted the supply of natural gas and drove down its price. Natural gas was cheaper than coal as a power source as of last year. Utilities, including in Kentucky, have moved to gas-fired turbines as a replacement for coal-fired power plants because of the economics and environmental considerations. Burning natural gas, which is mostly methane, emits roughly half the heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change as burning coal. 
According to EIA data, the country produced about 51% of its electricity from burning coal and 17% of its electricity from burning natural gas in 2001. As of 2023, coal produced only about 16% of the country’s electricity; natural gas produced 43%.
Wind and solar costs have also significantly fallen over the past 15 years, spurring an acceleration of renewable energy development across the country. Other coal-reliant states that have leapfrogged Kentucky in the competition to hold down power costs have taken advantage of the boom of both natural gas and renewables that are now generally cheaper than burning coal. 

Daniel Tait, a research and communications policy director with the pro-clean energy utility watchdog organization Energy and Policy Institute, says North Dakota and Wyoming — the two states with the cheapest electricity across all types of ratepayers as of 2023 — exemplify that trend. 
Tait told the Lantern that North Dakota, Wyoming and Kentucky are all big producers and consumers of coal, but Wyoming and North Dakota have been able to develop a significant amount of wind energy.
In 2001, North Dakota generated about 95% of its electricity through coal, according to the EIA. In 2023, the state still generated about 54% of its electricity through coal, but now more than a third of its power comes from wind. Wyoming has more than doubled its wind energy capacity since 2019; wind delivered about 20% of its electricity in 2023.
“They have a lot of coal in North Dakota and Wyoming, but they have so much more wind that the costs are declining because renewable energy is a very, very cheap energy source,” Tait said. 
Tait said that low-cost renewable energy can act as a buffer against higher coal prices or volatility of natural gas prices. 
Renewable energy is among the cheapest electricity sources for a few reasons. As the industries have grown, economies of scale have driven down costs, and there aren’t fuel costs associated with energy sourced from the wind and sun. A 2024 report from the financial services firm Lazard says on-shore wind and solar energy have a lower cost, on average, than fossil fuel sources. Even without government subsidies to lower the upfront costs for solar installations or wind turbines, renewables are generally still cheaper than fossil fuels, according to Lazard. 
Some others among the 10 states with the cheapest electricity still have nuclear power plants contributing to the energy mix. Such traditional nuclear power plants are expensive to build but produce relatively cheap electricity once they’re operating. Idaho and Washington benefit from inexpensive hydropower contributing large shares of their electricity. 
Kentucky, however, has lagged in diversifying its energy mix.
Tait likened Kentucky to Louisiana: Both rely on and are vulnerable to price increases from a fuel source they produce in large quantities — coal and natural gas, respectively. 
Kentucky has reduced its reliance on coal by replacing some generation with natural gas — about 24% of the state’s electricity in 2023 came from gas-fired power compared to just under 1% in 2001. But some industry and consumer rights groups warn natural gas exports could cause gas prices and electricity prices to rise in the future, concerns that the gas industry disputes. 
“Almost all the other states have something that is acting as a hedge that’s helping to keep prices down if coal or gas are expensive that year. And Kentucky doesn’t have as much of that as the other states do,” Tait said.
What Kentucky has: aging coal-fired power plants
  Kent Chandler
Kentucky’s reliance on coal leaves the state with aging coal-fired power plants that carry increasing maintenance costs and recurring costs to keep the plants compliant with environmental regulations. Maintenance and environmental compliance costs are driving up Kentucky’s power costs, something that could continue. Chandler compared utilities’ choices to deciding whether to spend money to keep an older car running versus buying a newer car. 
“If money isn’t an issue you can always keep it going, but you lose a lot of efficiency. The new cars that get built replace them and are more efficient,” Chandler said. “Does it make sense to just cut losses or cut time with this investment — with this facility — and instead move over and buy a new, efficient one that should have lower recurring costs?”
Coal-fired power plants must follow a number of federal environmental regulations, ranging from scrubbing the sulfur oxide emissions that create smog to controlling toxic metals emitted through wastewater.
When these regulations are reviewed and made more stringent by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, utilities come before the state PSC seeking approval to upgrade their plant’s pollution control systems to remain compliant with the regulations. Ratepayers pay for those upgrades through their utility bills. 
During his time at the PSC, Chandler said, Kentucky utilities did not adequately analyze the future costs of environmental compliance. He said that could leave consumers at risk of bearing increased costs for aging plants when it could be cheaper over the long term to replace them with a lower-cost alternative.

A 2023 report from Energy Innovation Policy and Technology, a nonpartisan think tank supporting policy that “reduces emissions at the speed and scale required for a safe climate future,” found the installation of new solar power was cheaper for ratepayers than running existing coal-fired power plants in Kentucky. 
“Doubling down on coal is not going to help the situation,” said Michelle Solomon, one of the report’s authors. “Diversifying the electricity mix with the cheapest available sources of energy, which are wind and solar, is really kind of the only avenue to reduce electricity prices.”
Kentucky legislators in recent years have taken steps to keep Kentucky more reliant on coal. The GOP-controlled legislature created additional bureaucracy and hurdles before the PSC can grant requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power generation. Backers of the new laws argued fossil fuel-fired power plants are needed to ensure reliability of the power grid.
Investor-owned utilities, including Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities, pushed back, arguing that one of the laws would threaten Kentucky’s economic advantage in attracting manufacturing. LG&E and KU President and CEO John Crockett in a 2023 op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader wrote that “some of our oldest coal plants need to be retired.”
Last year, the Kentucky legislature created a new board called the Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, or EPIC, that reviews requests from utilities to retire fossil fuel-fired power plant generation before those requests can reach the PSC. Crockett opposed the creation of EPIC but now is a commission member. 
Chandler is concerned those legislative moves could exacerbate the “sunk cost fallacy” — a reluctance to move away from something that one has heavily invested in, even when there’s evidence it’s time to move on — that helps explain why the state’s utilities and regulators have stuck with aging coal-fired power plants. 
“I think it will affect economic development in the future,” Chandler said. “Sticking with things, even after you lost your economic advantage, just means you’re perpetuating the negative economic harm that has already occurred to you by virtue of the markets.” 
What are Kentucky’s options?
Kentucky’s paths forward beyond its existing coal-fired power plant fleet will likely take years to develop.
Kaufman, the economist at Columbia University, and Solomon, the energy analyst at the climate-focused think tank, both argue Kentucky adopting more renewables would likely lower electricity costs and can be built relatively quickly. But adopting renewable energy on a large scale poses challenges. 
Renewables are intermittent, meaning that they only produce power during a portion of the day — such as when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing — and aren’t available on command like fossil fuel-fired power plants. Renewable energy advocates argue pairing wind and solar power to charge utility-scale batteries, which have also seen a significant drop in cost in the past 15 years, can make the resources more readily available around the clock.

Chandler in a co-authored blog post for the R Street Institute, a think tank “solving complex public policy challenges through free markets and limited, effective government,” noted the potentially expensive cost for more transmission lines and infrastructure to connect renewable energy to the grid is a barrier to wider renewable adoption and noted fossil fuel-fired power plants have historically served a role of “balancing” the electric grid. 
State lawmakers have also increasingly seen nuclear energy — which doesn’t emit greenhouse gasses — as a power source of the future, and lawmakers last year established a nuclear energy research authority housed at the University of Kentucky. 
But some energy analysts, including the leader of an energy research center at the University of Kentucky, question how quickly nuclear energy can be built in Kentucky to meet projected growth of future energy needs. The availability of natural gas-fired turbines is also limited in the future because of a backlog of turbine orders from utilities.
Stivers, who has advocated an all of the above approach and touted the state laws that make it harder to retire fossil fuel-fired power plants, told reporters at the end of the legislative session last month he was “all for creating new energy sources — cheaper, more efficient, environmentally friendly — but you got to make sure that grandma Lula on a fixed income doesn’t get the jacked up utility bill every month.” 
Affordability is especially relevant in a state like Kentucky where incomes are low. A 2022 report found electricity bills take a bigger bite out of Kentuckians’ wallets even though the average bill in Kentucky is lower than in the rest of the nation. A state-by-state analysis by the Citizens Board of Illinois found Kentucky’s average household electricity expenditures were below the national average but higher in percentage of household income going to pay electric bills.
Stivers, in an interview with the Lantern in early February, said he wanted Gov. Andy Beshear’s administration to incentivize “more generation here” and to look at “more clean coal, clean gas technologies in conjunction with other forms of generation such as nuclear.” 
“It’s kind of tragic when you think that one of your greatest assets now is not as strong an asset as it used to be,” he said. 
Kaufman, responding to the Lantern’s question about the economic viability of building a new coal-fired power plant, said “they haven’t really been built anywhere in the country for a long time” — in part because of environmental regulations, but largely because of economics. 
Politico on Tuesday reported Trump’s executive orders would likely only help keep existing coal-fired power plants afloat without expanding the market for coal, or, as an  energy executive told the outlet, changing the long-term outlook against coal-fired power.
The last large coal-fired power plant built in the country was in 2013, and no energy developer has floated a plan for a new plant since.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2209242000-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 06:07:05.815396

Imagine for a moment what would happen if the public schools in your community suddenly lost millions of dollars in resources for student programs.
Imagine losing hundreds of educators, classroom aides, and other support professionals. Imagine fewer school nurses and counselors supporting your students. Imagine class sizes ballooning and effective reading and math tutoring programs disappearing in the blink of an eye.
I don’t want to imagine it. None of us do.
But since taking office, President Trump and his administration have waged an unprecedented campaign to shutter the U.S. Department of Education and dismantle public education as we know it in this nation.
At risk is $1.6 billion in crucial federal funding that supports the education of 1.7 million public school students in rural, urban, and suburban communities across Pennsylvania — and a vast majority of Pennsylvanians do not want the Trump administration messing with it.
How do we know this? We asked them.
In a poll of 700 likely voters conducted for PSEA by Susquehanna Polling and Research between March 17 and 23, 58% said they oppose the idea of closing the U.S. Department of Education, while only 39% support it.
Delving deeper, we found remarkably high levels of support for key federally funded programs that support Pennsylvania’s most vulnerable students.

A whopping 88% of Pennsylvanians want the $428 million in federal funding Pennsylvania receives for students with special needs to remain the same or increase.
And 86% want the $578 million in federal funding the state gets for Title I programs, which fund academic support for low-income students, to remain the same or increase.
Anyone who reads polls — and these days we all do — knows that it’s tough to get a majority of any group to agree on something. Numbers this high are incredibly rare.
There is no question about it. Pennsylvanians want to see the federal government invest in their community schools and firmly oppose any effort to gut that funding or the Department of Education.
Our poll also found that more than half of Pennsylvanians want the federal government to allocate significantly more education funding than it does today. Fully 55% of those polled said that federal funding should account for 15% or more of total funding to Pennsylvania’s public schools.

How much do the state’s public schools actually receive in federal funding? Just over 5%, based on audited annual financial reports filed by school districts with the Pennsylvania Department of Education for the 2022-23 fiscal year.
Now, the Trump administration has been quick to say that federal funding is not being cut. After all, Congress would have to approve that. Right?
Well, the administration has not been shy about cutting congressionally approved funding. How many federal agencies, with congressionally approved budgets, have been wiped out of existence by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). USAID is just one of many examples.


Just as concerning is how closely the Trump administration has been adhering to Project 2025, a right-wing policy wish list that on page 350 explicitly calls for winding down the federal government’s role in public education funding.

Even if federal funding is untouched, shuffling the responsibilities of the Department of Education to other federal departments and agencies is a recipe for disaster. There is no guarantee that the staff will be there in other agencies or have the expertise to get the job done. It would undoubtedly put $1.6 billion in federal funding for Pennsylvania’s public schools in jeopardy.
This is happening. The threat is real. We must face it and do our best to understand what taking the department’s staff to zero looks like for our students.
Based on our poll results, Pennsylvanians are doing just that. And they don’t like what they see. They understand that this is about the federal government abdicating its responsibility to the children who learn in our public schools.
Closing the U.S. Department of Education is wrong. That’s what nearly six in 10 Pennsylvanians think. Now we need to tell the president and our U.S. senators and representatives that we won’t stand for it.

Senate Bill 426, known as the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act, also mandates Arkansas law enforcement agencies participate in a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that deputizes them to help ICE apprehend and deport undocumented migrants held in local jails and state prisons.
The Senate passed the bill 45-5 on April 2, with five of the chamber’s six Democrats opposed. Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pinebluff, was absent.
The House voted 73-20 with 2 voting present to pass SB 426 Wednesday night. 
The bill creates the following additional penalties depending on the type, or class, of felony:

A person convicted of a Class D felony, or an unclassified felony with no more than six years of prison time, would get up to four years added to the sentence;
A person convicted of a Class A, B or C felony, or an unclassified felony with a prison sentence between six and 30 years, would get up to 10 years added to the sentence;
A person convicted of a Class Y felony, or an unclassified felony with a prison sentence of longer than 30 years or life, would get up to 20 years added to the sentence.

In Wednesday’s committee meeting, Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen, a first-term Democrat from Springdale, spoke against the bill, telling her colleagues that the legislation will destroy trust between the Latino community and law enforcement that has taken years to build.
In the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, the bill’s House sponsor Walnut Ridge Republican Frances Cavenaugh said the bill fulfills Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ promise to help make Arkansans safer.
At a March 17 press conference announcing the legislation, Sanders said: “The Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act makes it clear: Arkansas will not tolerate violent, criminal illegals and will do our part to help the Trump administration keep our citizens safe.”

Wiley Nickel spoke at a packed “empty chair” town hall for Sen. Thom Tillis in March. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Former Rep. Wiley Nickel officially announced a 2026 campaign for U.S. Senate Wednesday, entering the Democratic primary for the opportunity to challenge incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) in the general election.
Nickel is a criminal defense attorney who served four years in the state Senate and two years in the U.S. House of Representatives before dropping his reelection bid in 2023 after his seat, the 13th Congressional District, was redrawn heavily favoring Republicans. He announced then that he would run in the state’s next Senate contest, filing with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate in December 2023.
Before moving to North Carolina to practice law in 2009, Nickel was a staffer for Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama. As a congressman, he was a member of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition and served on the Financial Services Committee.
His formal announcement comes as the 2026 Senate contest takes shape in North Carolina and around the country. Within the last week, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Michigan State Rep. Mallory McMorrow also announced Senate bids for closely contested seats, giving clearer definition to a midterm that will give Democrats a shot at flipping both chambers of Congress.
An ardent Tillis critic
In posts on social media, Nickel took aim at Tillis as “the most vulnerable Republican in Washington” who “continues to cave to Trump and extremists,” singling out the senator’s lack of pushback to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency cuts.
“Trump is shredding our Constitution and tanking our economy. Thom Tillis lacks the courage to stand up to him — I’ll be damned if I’m going to sit on the sidelines,” Nickel wrote in announcing his bid. “I’m running to fight for a better future for North Carolinians. Join our campaign — let’s take back the Senate.”
Tillis faces a challenging path to reelection as ire toward him has grown among both moderates and the Republican base, with President Donald Trump reportedly soliciting primary challengers against him in 2026 amid anger over his perceived disloyalty. As the stock market spiraled Tuesday ahead of Trump’s tariffs on all trade, Tillis asked U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer during a Senate hearing, “Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?”

At the same time, Tillis has come under fire among detractors to his left over a refusal to vote against Trump on issues like the war in Ukraine and his controversial cabinet appointees. Most galling to his critics was the report that he promised Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s ex-sister-in-law that if she came forward with abuse allegations, his nomination would be halted, only to later cast the deciding vote in favor for him.
“When you fold once like that — when Trump says he’s going to primary you and Elon Musk says he’s going to spend a bunch of money — you will fold every single time,” Nickel said at an empty chair town hall for Tillis held last month. “His vote is no longer for North Carolinians; it is just for Donald Trump.”
In a preview of his Senate campaign stump speech, Nickel told Triangle voters at Raleigh Brewing Company in March that Tillis was “turning his back on all of us here” in acquiescing to Trump and Musk’s cuts to government agencies and services, including Social Security and Medicaid.
“Trump’s policies are hurting working families in North Carolina, but when Democrats have leverage in the U.S. Congress, we have to use it,” Nickel said. “We need to fight, we need to demand action from all of our representatives, Republicans and Democrats.”
“Now I have a call to action,” he added. “It’s a message for our elected officials, like Thom Tillis, to stop catering to Donald Trump, to stop hiding from your constituents, to stop lying to the American people and screwing them over with spineless votes.”
In a statement Wednesday morning, Tillis campaign manager Abby Roesch derided Nickel as a “radical left-wing trial lawyer who was a rubber stamp for Joe Biden’s failed liberal agenda.”
“Every vote he casts will be bought and paid for by his Democratic Party bosses and the fringe left-wing special interest groups that will bankroll his campaign,” Roesch said. “Next year, the choice for North Carolinians will be between a radical liberal trial lawyer and a commonsense conservative problem solver. We are ready for the fight.”
The state of the race
Nickel enters a race that will likely be among the most closely contested and expensive 2026 election battles given North Carolina’s critical role in determining control of the Senate.
Aside from Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), whose state was won by Kamala Harris in the presidential election, Tillis is the most vulnerable incumbent Republican up for reelection in 2026. For Democrats, any path to flipping the Senate likely runs through Tillis, as they would need to flip four Republican-held seats to retake the majority.
A key factor in the closeness of the upcoming race is Tillis’s unpopularity, with a March survey by Raleigh’s Public Policy Polling finding his approval rating deep in the negatives, with only 25% approving and 46% disapproving of his job performance. While the poll did not test Nickel against Tillis, it found Tillis trailing former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper 47% to 43% in a hypothetical matchup.
Tillis currently faces two declared primary challengers, moderate businessman Andy Nilsson and far-right author and former U.S. Navy JAG officer Don Brown, though neither has held elected office before.

Former Lt. Governor Mark Robinson, sunk by scandal in the 2024 governor’s race, publicly ruled out a run in January. Freshman Rep. Pat Harrigan (R-NC-10), a former U.S. Army Green Beret, has also been rumored as a Tillis challenger, and in March called out the senator for listing him on a campaign kick-off fundraiser without his knowledge.
Aside from the specter of a primary challenge, the other major domino to fall in North Carolina’s Senate race will be Cooper’s decision. While he told supporters “I’m not done” in his 2024 farewell address, he has remained circumspect when asked about specific plans. Expected to be a favorite in the primary if he runs, Cooper has maintained a public presence in North Carolina politics, blasting Judge Jefferson Griffin’s challenge to the Supreme Court election in January.
With his announcement Wednesday, Nickel becomes the only declared candidate for the Democratic Senate nomination thus far.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wiley-Nickel-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-10 06:07:05.815396

But its local zoning ordinance has gone largely unchanged since the early 1970s — when some of its current residents weren’t yet alive. 
By 2019, the county decided to begin work on its zoning ordinance modernization project — colloquially called ZOMod — and it is likely to be adopted this year. But first, county leaders want to hear how residents feel about the plan, so community outreach and feedback opportunities are on the horizon. 
Over the next month, the county is hosting pop-up events around town to present the latest ZOMod draft and request comments on it (which will typically begin around 5:30 p.m.). The Planning Commission is expected to vote on the draft this summer and it could come before the Board of Supervisors by the fall. 
Laura Dobbs, policy director at Housing Opportunities Made Equal, stressed that passage of the new zoning draft is a crucial step in longer-range planning and housing needs for the urban-yet-rural county that wraps around the city of Richmond. 
“The biggest danger is that status quo isn’t working,” Dobbs said. 
Housing costs to buy or rent in Virginia have been rising, driven by a shortage of about 105,000 homes, according to recent Pew research. For renters, nearly half of American households nationwide are spending at least 30% of their income on rent, and the majority of low-income households spend at least 50%. 
Dobbs stressed that increased density in some areas can help with housing affordability for buyers and renters. For instance, Chesterfield’s current rules require that single-family homes must be built on 12,000 square-foot lots — which contributes to driving up prices for people looking for starter homes.
HOME of VA staff have commended localities like Charlottesville for how they handled their own zoning and comprehensive plan updates — a process that entailed robust community engagement that resulted in the allowance of more types of housing to help with broader affordability. 
The updated zoning plan will also correct parts of Chesterfield’s local housing policy that was historically exclusionary, Dobbs said. 
When much of its current rules were last updated in the early 1970s, it was a time of “white flight” following the Civil Rights Movement, when white families were flocking to suburban areas. Local governments adopted land use laws that all but sequestered affluent and white families from other communities by creating barriers for lower-income and often minority families from moving in. 
Governments had a role to play in that racial inequity, but they also have a role in undoing it too, Dobbs said. 
“There’s an opportunity here,” Dobbs said, “to right past wrongs, by making more housing available.”
The current document is “race-neutral but taking the steps” to rectify past wrongs, Dobbs added. 
For instance, the current draft allows for denser housing types like apartments and duplexes and development on smaller lot sizes. This helps with affordability more broadly because more homes can then come into an area with less suburban sprawl, which helps conserve the more rural parts of the county, too. 
For residents who may be wary of the new zoning in Chesterfield or other localities, Finn Pollard with the Partnership for Smarter Growth said new zoning doesn’t mean new developments will drastically alter a neighborhood overnight. New zoning and the county’s comprehensive plan will, however, offer guidance for what different parcels of land could someday become if they are sold or redeveloped. 
While housing affordability issues are rooted and experienced locally, it has become a focus for lawmakers at the state and federal levels as well. Virginia lawmakers from both political parties submitted related proposals this legislative session, ranging from measures to strengthen renter protections to ones that encourage localities to address affordability and develop along certain corridors.

(Courtesy of Richmond International Airport)Air travel in Virginia could face growing strain, TSA officers warned Wednesday, as they staged a one-hour protest at Richmond International Airport over the federal government’s decision to strip them of key workplace protections. 
While operations remained steady during the demonstration, officers cautioned that the rollback could undermine safety and staffing at security checkpoints across the state.
The protest was sparked by a move from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate the collective bargaining agreement that had allowed TSA officers to negotiate over working conditions — a significant shift in how the agency interacts with its workforce. 
TSA officers, who screen passengers and baggage at security checkpoints across the country, say the loss of these rights has left them more vulnerable and less able to speak up on issues that directly affect passenger safety and operational efficiency.
The change followed the March 27 executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which excluded the TSA from federal labor protections under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute and the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.
The agency defended the decision, saying collective bargaining had “constrained” TSA’s mission “to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe.”
But union leaders strongly disagree, calling the move a direct threat to both employee wellbeing and public safety. The American Federation of Government Employees Local 448, which represents TSA officers, said its members have been “disrespected, demeaned, and degraded” by businessman and presidential advisor Elon Musk — a senior figure in the Trump administration — and by the administration itself since Trump returned to office in January.
Sherry Markham, a Navy veteran turned TSA officer, said the collective bargaining agreement had been essential in addressing practical concerns — from parking cost to uniform expenses to scheduling practices that directly impact travelers. 
“It’s ensuring that we have the ability to come in, focus on our positions and not worry about anything other than that, but without that in place, there’s a fear we’re left exposed,” Markham said. “The CBA did so much for us (including) the pay equity and our rights in general. It’s been amazing and without that in place, everyone is just scared.”
The union has filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, arguing that the administration’s move to dismantle the agreement is not only anti-worker but also short-sighted.
In a public statement, DHS countered that union activities had interfered with operations. The department claimed that officers tasked with union-related responsibilities diverted staff from frontline security duties at the country’s 432 airports. It also defended recent changes that reward performance over seniority — another union concern — saying they help recognize standout employees more fairly.
“Thanks to Secretary Noem’s action, Transportation Security Officers will no longer lose their hard-earned dollars to a union that does not represent them. The Trump Administration is committed (to) returning to merit-based hiring and firing policies,” DHS said.
The department added that the change would lead to a “more effective and modernized workforce” across the nation’s transportation networks. “TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.”
But the TSA union argues that the agency overstepped its legal authority. In its lawsuit filed against Noem, the union stated that the collective bargaining agreement — signed just last year with a seven-year term — is “a binding contract” that cannot be unilaterally terminated by the secretary.
For longtime officers like Calvin Nelson, who joined TSA straight out of high school 18 years ago, the rollback feels personal. Now raising a child, Nelson said the CBA helped ensure a more “comfortable” wage — critical for officers juggling life’s growing demands.
Nelson recalled how difficult it was before the agreement took effect, noting that some of his coworkers had to work two or three jobs just to stay afloat.
“I’ve seen a lot of things change. A lot of things get better, and it seems like losing collective bargaining, we’re going backwards versus going forward,” Nelson said.
“My coworkers and I need collective bargaining to protect us,” he added. “Without it, we feel unprotected.”

Rivers of yellow plant dust lining local streets. Seemingly year-round symptoms: Residents of southeastern Virginia are all too familiar with the effects of pollen.
But a recent report from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America confirms it: Hampton Roads is particularly sneezy.
The nonprofit listed the Virginia Beach region as the 11th most challenging place in the U.S. for allergy sufferers, out of the 100 most populated areas.
Richmond rated a few notches higher, at No. 8. Wichita, Kansas took the top spot.
The Allergy Foundation scores cities based on annual pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use and the number of allergists in the area.
Why did Hampton Roads rate so high? WHRO spoke with Jim Blando, an associate professor in environmental health with Old Dominion University, to find out.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
WHRO: What did you think when you saw the recent report?
Jim Blando: My first thought was, not surprising at all. Here, we have several characteristics that are very interesting – one of the major ones being that it’s warm and we have a lot of moisture. We’re surrounded by a lot of water, tend to get storms coming off the ocean that can dump a lot of water in the area and result in flooding. The more moisture and the more warmth that you have, the more growth you’re going to have. If you have structures, leaky roofs and those sorts of things, they get wet and they start growing mold, plants and vegetation will grow more and produce more pollen as a result of that.
Because of where we’re located, we have a really interesting variety of plants and things that will grow here. And in fact I’ve been told by botanists that we can have northern plants and southern plants both growing in the same area around here because the ranges overlap of these different plants. So the consequence of that is you have a tremendous variety of plants that bloom all different times a year, produce lots of different types of pollen. Add on top of that that we’re a pretty populated area, lots of aerosols that are generated from traffic and other things. The combination oftentimes can result in more severe reactions to allergies and those sorts of things. Ozone can be produced because of the sort of urban mix that we have. That combination of pollens and biologic aerosols, mold spores and chemical pollutants, oftentimes can result in more severe reactions to allergies.
WHRO: And then I understand climate change is also expected to make things worse. Why and how is that?








JB: Overall warming of the global mean temperature generally has resulted in longer pollen seasons. So plants start blooming earlier, they start producing pollen earlier, and they produce it for longer. Plants also tend to produce more pollen. Some of the studies that USDA has done and others have shown that some of the pollens that are produced by, for example, certain types of trees, the proteins in their pollen that causes the allergies, the actual allergen content is actually increasing with increasing temperatures, especially increasing temperatures at night. The data has shown that the pollen season has extended both on the front and the back end. As a result of that, people’s exposure is not only increasing (in) quantity, but it’s also increasing in length of time, which means people are likely to experience a longer period of allergic symptoms.
One of the big impacts that sea level rise will have is it will cause areas to get flooded that maybe weren’t getting flooded routinely. You’re going to have more moisture, more mold, more plant growth. When you have more extreme rainfall, you have the same amount of moisture in a much shorter period of time. If it’s coming down so fast that there’s not enough time for the water to drain through the soil, you can have more flooding. And again that flooding is going to breed all kinds of things that can be problematic. So it really is a problem.
Climate change doesn’t necessarily just mean dry and hot all the time. Really what it means is the whole system’s out of balance. So you have this cycling between droughts and floods.
It’s really that complex interplay between the seasons, the amount of moisture, what the weather patterns are, and climate change is impacting all of that.
WHRO: I think people sometimes think of allergies as a nuisance, and they are. But what are some of the longer-term health impacts of allergy exposure?
JB: One of the things that allergies will do is it’ll certainly prime your immune system and there are some people that tend to have more of an inflammatory response than others. People that have things like eczema, psoriasis, allergic asthma, you’ll find that they tend to have a stronger pro-inflammatory response when they’re exposed to things, especially things that are allergenic like pollens and mold spores. The short-term consequence is that you’re more likely to have an allergic reaction that will precipitate an asthma attack. And anybody that has asthma could certainly tell you that it’s not a pleasant experience. It can be really problematic, and results in hospitalizations. People that are exposed to pollutants and allergens together are more likely to have a more severe respiratory infection.
Now the long-term consequences is that, when people have this sort of pro-inflammatory response, certain aspects of your biological response will result in inflammation, and chronic inflammation over a long period of time could be associated potentially with other adverse conditions, like for example having their respiratory function gradually decrease over time.
WHRO: So what can people do to protect themselves?
JB: Certainly people should visit with their health care provider and get whatever appropriate medical care that they need. I think it’s always a good idea, especially if you have a condition like asthma, to not only have your primary care physician, but have somebody who specializes in allergies or asthma that also is caring for you.There are over the counter medicines that can be beneficial for people that have allergies.
For some environmental controls, a few things that are beneficial is for example, in-home air cleaners, especially HEPA filters. Studies have shown that, in fact, your typical filtration system can have a very positive impact on lowering the concentration of pollens and other particles in the home. The only caution that we oftentimes will tell folks is that our advice has always been to buy filtration or air cleaners that have filters in them, like a HEPA filter or high-efficiency filter. Some of the air cleaners use electrical pulses or discharges. One of the unfortunate things about using electrical discharges and trying to generate ions and those sorts of things is you can generate ozone, and ozone is a very strong irritant also. So while you’re trying to fix one problem, you could be creating another. So our advice to people is get the filtration base.
Recognize your triggers and think about, how can I practically reduce my exposure to those triggers? Think about what kind of plants you put inside the home. You walk around on your lawn and your shoes are covered in pollen. If you take your shoes off before you walk around your house so you don’t spread it all around your house. If you’re cutting the grass or doing yard work and cutting up plants and pruning and doing those things, maybe change your clothes before you start sitting around on the furniture in your home. Of course we have to live in the real world. Nobody lives in a bubble. So you’re certainly not going to get away from pollens and molds because they’re ubiquitous in the environment. Whatever’s practically possible.

Jerry O'Connor gives testimony in favor of a bill that would require state agencies to report on various metrics for training and workforce development programs they supervise. (Screenshot/WisEye)Republicans in the state Legislature are taking another run at changes to unemployment insurance and workforce programs in Wisconsin that Gov. Tony Evers vetoed in August 2023.
While sponsors of the bills cited a couple of modifications in some measures, they are for the most part unchanged, they said during public hearings Wednesday for four bills in the Assembly’s labor committee.
One, AB 162, would require state agencies to compile a series of metrics on training and workforce development programs under their supervision, including the unemployment rates and median earnings of participants six months after they graduate from a program.
“We want to make certain our money’s being spent in a way that generates a positive beneficial return both for taxpayers and for the individuals participating in the programs,” said state Rep. Jerry O’Connor (R-Fond du Lac), testifying in favor of the bill. “We’d look at the percent of individuals enrolled in training programs who obtained a measurable skill gain.”
O’Connor said the bill draws its performance measures from the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), a federal workforce training law updated in 2014.
In vetoing the version of the bill that passed the last session of the Legislature, Evers said that many state programs it covered didn’t fit with WIOA’s reporting structure and “have separate requirements under current state law.”
Three other bills would impose tighter restrictions on the unemployment insurance (UI) system.
AB 167 would expand the definition of employee misconduct that would be grounds for denying an unemployment insurance claim as well as for a worker’s compensation claim. The bill would also require DWD to conduct random audits of 50% of all work searches reported by people claiming UI.
AB 168 would extend the statute of limitations for prosecuting felony fraudulent UI claims to eight years. It would also require the state Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to produce more training materials for employers and UI claimants, operate a call center and expand its hours in times of higher volume, check various state and national databases to verify that UI applicants qualify, and implement “identity-proofing” measures.
AB 169 would penalize UI recipients who do not show up for a job interview they have been granted or a job they’ve been offered — “commonly referred to as ghosting,” said state Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown), the bill’s author.
A UI recipient who fails to respond to an interview request or job offer, fails to report for a scheduled job interview or who is not available to return to work at their previous job would lose unemployment benefits for the week in which that occurred. The bill does not impose the penalty for the first offense.
State Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) asked Knodl whether the bill had gone through the state’s Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council. The joint labor-management body revises the state’s UI law every two years. In the past Evers has vetoed UI proposals for not going through the council. 
“This is one of those that they’re not going to visit,” Knodl said. “So that’s why we’re here as a stand-alone bill.”
Nobody testified against the bills Wednesday, but Victor Forberger, a Madison attorney who represents people with UI claims, sent the committee a four-page memo opposing them. He wrote that DWD already does most of what AB 168 would require, and that it would “hamstring” the department “when new practices and resources emerge.”
The measures “will do nothing to make unemployment more useful and efficient for Wisconsin workers and employers,” Forberger wrote.

With the districts’ sitting Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) announcing his campaign for governor on Monday, his seat, which was a key target for Democrats in 2024, will be open in the coming 2026 election. 
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Tuesday listed Michigan’s 10th Congressional District as one of its targets for 2026. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district as leaning Republican. 
Greimel previously served as a state representative from 2012 to 2018, leading House Democrats as the chamber’s minority leader from 2013 through 2016. 
In an interview with the Michigan Advance, Greimel touted his work in the Legislature, successfully fighting to expand Michigan Medicaid alongside raising the minimum wage and tying it to inflation, emphasizing that people want fighters in Washington. 
“I did those things as House Minority Leader when Republicans controlled the House, the Senate and the governorship. So I’ve always been in the fight, but even more importantly, I’ve won those fights, delivered results, improved people’s economic wellbeing and expanded access to the American dream,” he said.

“We need fighters in Washington who are going to stand up against unelected billionaires like Elon Musk, and I’ve been doing that my entire adult life, including as a union-side labor lawyer and civil rights attorney,” Greimel said. 
Middle class and working families have been hurting for years, especially given the inflation that came out of the pandemic and the economic uncertainty generated by President Donald Trump’s administration, Greimel said, telling the Advance his campaign would be centered on the economy and improving the economic wellbeing of residents. 
“We’ve got to continue to improve access to affordable health care, and we need to do more to create more good paying jobs, but also make sure that people have the training and education needed to get those good paying jobs,” Greimel said, pushing back against Trump’s efforts to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. 
He also criticized the President’s approach to foreign trade policy, saying the country needs strategic tariffs against countries like China that will bring good paying manufacturing jobs back to the states “without engaging in this reckless free for all” and imposing tariffs on countries like Canada, which shares economic interests with Michigan and the U.S.
Greimel listed clean water as another concern for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.

(George Frey/Getty Images)For the first time in decades, America needs to produce more electricity.


This is the second of two States Newsroom stories examining the implications of the growing need for electricity largely from artificial intelligence and data centers. Read the first story here.


In many places, a sharp uptick in power demand has been driven by data centers, the industrial buildings that house huge banks of computer servers and support our increasingly digital society.
State lawmakers have long sought to attract such operations with generous tax breaks and incentives. But now, some are concerned that the infrastructure needed to add all those data centers to the electric grid will drive up residents’ utility bills. The growing use of artificial intelligence, which requires massive amounts of computing power, has added to that worry.
“We’re going to have tremendous stress from AI,” said New Jersey state Sen. Bob Smith, a Democrat who chairs the Environment and Energy Committee. “We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens. Why should they bear the rate increases?”
Smith has authored a bill that would require new AI data centers in New Jersey to arrange to supply their power from new, clean energy sources, if other states in the region enact similar measures.
The bill is among roughly a dozen proposals in state legislatures nationwide seeking to ensure that data centers don’t result in increased rates for other electric customers, according to the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. Smith and lawmakers in other states with clean energy targets also say the demand for AI could derail their climate goals.
Those goals are also under attack from President Donald Trump, who this week directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to block enforcement of all state climate policies. Trump also issued orders seeking to boost coal production, in part to meet the energy demands from AI operations.
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Tech companies note that their data centers are crucial for everything from credit card transactions to remote work to streaming Netflix. And the centers create tax revenue and jobs in the states that host them, the companies argue.
Data centers are just the first wave in a new era of increased electricity demand. Electric vehicles, a growing manufacturing sector and the electrification of household appliances are all expected to use more power in the years to come.
Industry leaders say it’s unfair to single out data centers, when more power will be needed for a variety of sectors.
“[Targeting data centers] risks creating unjustified distinctions amongst similar customers,” said Dan Diorio, senior director of state policy with the Data Center Coalition, a membership association for tech companies.
Ground zero: Virginia
Virginia hosts the world’s largest concentration of data centers, and is at the epicenter of debates over the industry’s future.
State lawmakers commissioned a study, published last year, to outline the industry’s impacts. Researchers found that data centers are currently paying their fair share for electricity. But the immense energy demands they’re forecasted to create in the coming years “will likely increase system costs for all customers, including non-data center customers,” the report concluded.
The study found that unconstrained demand largely from data centers would drive up Virginia’s energy usage 183% by 2040. With no new data centers, energy use would only grow 15%. In addition to the costs of building more power plants, the report said, utilities will also need to install more substations, transformers and distribution lines.
“They sounded an alarm that the steep increase — if this is unchecked — would quickly [raise consumers’ rates],” said state Del. Rip Sullivan, a Democrat who has been at the center of discussions over the industry’s future in Virginia.
Sullivan sponsored a bill that would have required data centers to meet energy efficiency standards to qualify for certain tax exemptions, but the measure did not advance this session. Virginia lawmakers passed a measure this session directing state regulators to determine whether utilities should create a special rate that certain customers such as data centers must pay.
States rethink data centers as ‘electricity hogs’ strain the grid

Several other states are considering similar bills that aim to put data centers — or large electricity users more generally — in their own “rate class.” Proponents say that would prevent the costs of generating enough electricity for those centers from being spread to household customers.
Data center proponents have argued that regulators are best suited to set the rules, not lawmakers.
“The industry is committed to ensuring it continues to pay its full cost of service to ensure that other customers are protected from any unnecessary costs,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy for the Data Center Coalition.
Sullivan noted that data centers are critical to our digital society, and that the Virginia study found that the industry creates construction jobs and local tax revenue. But Virginia also aims to produce 100% of its electricity from sources without any carbon emissions by 2050 — a goal that will become more difficult if power demands skyrocket. The state urgently needs a comprehensive strategy to manage all those interests, Sullivan said.
‘You get good and bad’
For years, states have tried to lure data centers with tax incentives or exemptions. At least 36 states, both conservative and liberal, offer such incentives. But now, some of the states that have been most successful at attracting the industry are having second thoughts.
Georgia state Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Republican, noted that electric customers in the state have seen six rate increases in less than two years. Data centers, he said, use immense amounts of power and water, while creating few long-term jobs. On the other hand, he noted that they have proven to be a substantial source of property tax revenue.
“You get good and bad with the data centers, but I just want to make sure they pay their way,” he said.
Hufstetler authored a bill that would have barred regulators from raising rates because of the costs of serving data centers. While the bill did not pass this session, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a new rule with similar protections, forcing data centers to cover those costs.
The move is a good start, Hufstetler said, but legislation is still needed because regulators can quickly roll back their own rules. Meanwhile, Georgia lawmakers passed a measure last year that would have paused the state’s sales tax exemption for data centers. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed the bill, arguing that an abrupt change would undermine companies’ planned investments in Georgia.
Consumer advocates say more states should rescind their incentives.
States Debate Whether to Restrict — Or Invite — Crypto Mining

Many data centers don’t bring in enough tax revenue to cover their tax breaks, said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that tracks government subsidies related to economic development.
“It’s not a winning program for state budgets,” she said.
Oregon has seen a rapid increase in data centers in the eastern part of the state, said state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat.
“Data center growth is outstripping every other kind of conventional user category,” she said. “There’s lots of evidence that the demand of those data centers has already been shifted onto residential ratepayers.”
Marsh has sponsored a bill that would require data centers and other large energy users to be assigned to a separate rate class that accounts for the added costs of their power demands.
In a letter to Oregon lawmakers, Amazon Web Services — the computing subsidiary of the retail giant — said it has worked with utilities to ensure its costs aren’t being passed to other ratepayers. The company noted its commitments to purchase large amounts of renewable energy, and said major grid upgrades are needed to enable more clean power and the deployment of technologies like electric vehicles.
Amazon Web Services did not grant an interview request. Two other industry leaders, Google and OpenAI, did not respond to Stateline inquiries.
Utah enacted a law this year that allows “large load” customers such as data centers to craft separate contracts with utilities. It’s intended to ensure that household ratepayers don’t get hit with additional costs to power those facilities. Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, who sponsored the bill, did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
“This new demand requires billions of dollars of capital investment,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. “The normal model is you spread that investment cost across all consumers. That’s not reasonable here.”
Slocum said data center users have been shying away from previous commitments to use clean energy sources, at the same time Trump has pushed to increase fossil fuel production.
Some lawmakers have noted that many data centers are being built to meet forecasted demand from AI. They worry that overhyped projections could force utilities to build expensive infrastructure that never gets used.










We have a crisis coming our way in electric rates. These outrageous increases are going to be put on the citizens.


– New Jersey Democratic state Sen. Bob Smith


Industry leaders say the build-out of data centers is driven by consumer demands and note that such facilities have made computing far more efficient.
They also argue that digital infrastructure is important for national security, ensuring that Americans’ data is not passing through overseas facilities with weak security. And they warn that companies may be wary of investing in states with legislation seen as disruptive.
“This is an industry that is trying to build out to meet unprecedented demand,” said Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition. “[State legislation] can send a market signal that there’s going to be friction in that market.”

Wayne Long (right), R-Bradford, present to the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs a bill they sponsored, Senate Bill 536, to abolish the Arkansas State Library on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas House committee Wednesday rejected a bill that would abolish the State Library and its board, making it difficult for the proposal to make it to the governor’s desk by the end of the legislative session April 16.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, has repeatedly promised to dissolve the State Library Board and broadened this mission when he filed Senate Bill 536 last month. He told the House Committee on State Agencies and Governmental Affairs on Wednesday that the State Library and local libraries need more “accountability” to the government entities that fund them.
SB 536 passed the Senate last week by the slimmest possible margin. It would transfer the authorities, funds, contracts and employees of the agency and its board to the Arkansas Department of Education. The State Library is already under the department’s umbrella but operates independently, and its board disburses state funds to public libraries on a quarterly basis.
Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said the department is more than capable of carrying out the State Library’s responsibilities, but committee members were unconvinced. Rep. Stan Berry, R-Dover, said he had “little faith” that the department’s oversight would resolve any of the issues Sullivan said he had with the State Library and its board.
Arkansas Senate narrowly OKs dissolution of State Library; bill heads to House

Berry and seven other committee members voted against SB 536, and five more were absent or did not vote. Seven members voted to pass the bill, including Rep. Wayne Long, R-Bradford, the bill’s House sponsor, who called the State Library Board “too big for their britches.”
Long and Sullivan said they took issue with the board rejecting two motions last month to protect children in libraries and to detach from the American Library Association. At the same meeting, the board passed a separate motion aimed at protecting children in libraries while upholding the First Amendment.
Conservatives statewide, including State Library Board member and former Republican state senator Jason Rapert, have called for libraries to keep children from accessing content considered inappropriate for them. SB 536 would codify several new criteria for libraries to receive state funds, including “prohibit[ing] access to age-inappropriate materials to a person who is sixteen (16) years old or younger.”
SB 536 defines “age-inappropriate material” as “books, media, or any other material accessible at a public library containing images or explicit and detailed descriptions” of sexual acts, sexual contact and human genitalia.
Bobbie Guerra, a homeschooling mother from Lowell, said putting the Department of Education “in direct control of public libraries would put homeschooling parents who utilize libraries as educational resources at the mercy of… what [it] deems age-appropriate.”
Additionally, SB 536’s language was just as “flawed and fatal” as that of Act 372 of 2023, said Arkansas Library Association President-elect Adam Webb, referring to a Sullivan-sponsored law partially blocked in federal court that the state is appealing. The blocked sections of Act 372 would have given local elected officials the final say over whether to relocate challenged library materials some consider “obscene” and made librarians legally liable for disseminating such materials.
SB 536 does not mention “obscenity” or “sexually explicit” material despite its supporters routinely mentioning the latter, Webb said.
“When judges tell you, ‘Here’s the type of speech that you can regulate, [here’s what is] sexually explicit, here are the definitions,’ use it,” he said. “Don’t reinvent the wheel, but here we are again two years later with the same vague language.”

 More opposition

Webb is also the director of the Garland County Library, and he was one of nine Arkansans who spoke against SB 536.
Judy Calhoun, the recently retired director of the Southeast Arkansas Regional Library system, and Faulkner-Van Buren Regional Library director John McGraw said SB 536 created “unfunded mandates,” such as requiring libraries to have interlibrary loan programs and to meet minimum hours of operation per year in order to receive state funds.
Journalist, professor and historian Sonny Rhodes said he had a problem with the bill changing the oversight of certain historical records, which the State Library currently oversees.
“If SB 536 results in the loss or restricted access to such databases, it could hinder research efforts, making it harder to produce informed and accurate academic research,” Rhodes said.
Four Arkansans spoke for the bill, including representatives of the Family Council and the all-Republican Saline County Quorum Court. All four said they struggle to attend their local libraries with the children in their families due to content they consider inappropriate and easily visible.
The committee spent several minutes debating two sex education books that Greenbrier Republican Rep. Stephen Meeks, a member of the committee, challenged in 2021 with the goal of removing them from the Faulkner-Van Buren Regional Library.
However, SB 536’s appropriateness criteria includes a limited exception for sex education materials, which would be accessible to minors between 12 and 15 years old. Those under 12 would not be able to access such materials if their parents or guardians have forbidden their access in writing.
  Rep. Howard Beaty, Jr., R-Crossett
SB 536 also puts specific higher education requirements in place for library directors. Rep. Jeremy Wooldridge, R-Marmaduke, said this provision led him to oppose the bill because every library director in his Northeast Arkansas district “would have to be replaced.”
Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, also voted against the bill and said “both sides are going to lose.”
“Shame on y’all… I think this could have been resolved very easily,” Beaty said. “Folks dug their heels in and decided they weren’t going to negotiate.”

George Nardone, a Coventry Republican, thinks this year’s edition is his best yet. 
“Taxpayers expect and deserve transparent stewardship of their money,” Nardone said, at a press conference at the State House Wednesday. “If we cannot track how public funds are spent, we cannot expect the public to trust us with their funds.”
An hour later, his bipartisan legislation, which has 23 co-sponsors, had its first vetting before the House Committee on Finance. The perennial proposal dating back to at least 2002 aims to root out waste, abuse and fraud through an independent Office of the Inspector General empowered to review, audit and investigate state and local public agencies and officials. Nardone has been the primary sponsor for the last six years.
“I’m exhausted,” he told lawmakers Wednesday.
This year’s edition offers a few revisions, reducing the number of state general office holders who get to appoint the inspector general while extending the maximum tenure from a single five-year term to two, five-year terms. Nardone’s bill also seeks to head off recurring pushback from those who consider an inspector general unnecessary, duplicating legal and financial reviews performed by the state attorney general, auditor general and the Rhode Island Office of Internal Audit.
Nardone’s bill would fold the auditor general’s office into the inspector general. And, it gives the inspector general oversight over subpoenas and investigations by the Office of Internal Audit.
The auditor general now reports to House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi as head of the Joint Committee on Legislative Services, while the Office of Internal Audit is controlled by the executive branch.
“We think an office that is more generally responsible to the entire state would be much more efficacious,” House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale, a Foster Republican, said at the press conference. 
A majority of Rhode Islanders agree: 75% according to a June survey conducted by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University. Support among registered Democratic voters surveyed topped 70%, with higher levels among independent and Republican voters.
However, when voters were asked in the Nov. 5 election whether they wanted to hold a state constitutional convention — an alternate route to create a state inspector general — the ballot measure failed by a 25 percentage point margin.
President Donald Trump fired 17 federal inspectors general after taking office in January. Chippendale said the majority of the 100 federal oversight agents still had their jobs; those whose positions were eliminated were let go for failing to perform their duties, he said.

The Massachusetts model 
Rhode Island doesn’t have to look far to find an example of the proposal in action. Massachusetts created the first statewide independent inspector general’s office in 1981. Eleven other states have since followed suit.
Jeffrey Shapiro, the fifth inspector general for the Bay State, returned to the Rhode Island State House basement Wednesday to describe his office’s work. Shapiro made his debut on Smith Hill to speak on Nardone’s legislation in May 2024.
This year’s visit took much less time — he came from a different part of Massachusetts and was able to avoid  Washington Bridge traffic, he said in an interview prior to the hearing.
In the 11 months since Shapiro last visited Rhode Island lawmakers, he’s resolved three criminal cases that ended in a combined $311,000 in restitution, plus prison time. Then there was the 138-page September 2024 report detailing how the Commonwealth wasted $60 million on a “sham” procurement and subsequent 20-year lease for the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth “Star Store” campus in New Bedford. The downtown arts campus abruptly closed in 2023. 
Less easily calculable, but no less impactful, were the illegal and improper procurements that never happened thanks to a citizens training school Massachusetts created, which helped 2,000 people learn about state procurement laws in 2024, Shapiro said.
He declined to comment on Rhode Island’s proposal, instead focusing on the general merits of a state inspector general.
“I come to you in support of independent government oversight,” Shapiro told lawmakers. 
Proponents say Rhode Island’s government operations and spending offer ample opportunities for similar savings and prevention: the Washington Bridge demolition and rebuild, the data breach of the RIBridges public benefits program, and a March 21 state audit flagging 22 examples of poor financial reporting, including misstating $83.6 million in the state’s general fund in fiscal 2024.
For Chippendale, proof of the need for a state inspector general came days earlier, when Gov. Dan McKee’s aides called various lawmakers pressuring them to take their names off an anti bid-rigging bill, the Providence Journal first reported.
“The executive branch, in my position, is not in the position to meddle into legislative affairs to this degree,” Chippendale said.
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday.
Nardone’s bill includes 13 Democratic co-sponsors, as well as the chamber’s lone independent, Rep. Jon Brien, of Woonsocket.
“This is not a political issue, this is a good government issue,” said Brien, who crowded into Chippendale’s office alongside the 10 House Republicans for the press conference.

Bills abound 
Brien is also co-sponsoring a separate inspector general bill led by Cranston Democratic Rep. Charlene Lima. Lima’s bill is less than half the length of Nardone’s and details similar fraud, waste and abuse powers for a state inspector general. But it leaves the appointment to the governor based on a vetting process led by a 14-member commission with representation from Rhode Island State Police, Common Cause Rhode Island and a seat reserved for former U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, among others. It also gives the inspector general the power to employ police officers to help with investigations, modeled after similar policies in the state of Georgia. 
Lima’s arguments for an independent investigator echoed Nardone’s comments.
“If you can save a minimum of $100 million by spending $1 million, c’mon, who wouldn’t take that deal?” Lima said to lawmakers during the hearing. “You know it. I know it. We have to do this for the people, for our people who send it up here.”
Former Rhode Island Rep. Frank Fiorenzano, who quipped he was “better known as Rep. Lima’s husband,” also spoke in support of her bill.
“I did a lot of research for her, and she said if you’re doing the research, you should also testify,” Fiorenzano said. He considers various spending by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, including on the Washington Bridge demolition contract, as potentially wasteful or fraudulent. “You could probably get away with half or three-quarters of the employees at DOT and it would still run the way it does now.”
Both Nardone and Lima said they were willing to merge their separate proposals into a single piece of legislation.
Across the rotunda, two similar, though not identical bills, have been introduced by Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican, and Sen. Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat. Hearings on the Senate bills have not been scheduled as of Wednesday, according to Greg Paré, a Senate spokesperson.
Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who was absent from State House sessions this week, declined to comment in an emailed statement, saying he is awaiting the bill hearing. 
But Shekarchi signaled hesitancy in a statement Wednesday, noting the lack of necessity and the cost of “millions of taxpayer dollars” when the state is already facing a projected $250 million structural deficit and threats of federal funding cuts.
Nardone estimated the new state office would cost $1.5 million a year, based on similar programs in other states. He suggested repurposing $1.2 million included in Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget to create an “office of program integrity” within the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services.
“Wouldn’t that money be better spent on a statewide inspector general?” Nardone said. 
He also cited a 2019 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers showing that per-capita spending in the 11 states with independent inspector generals was lower than in the states without them. Rhode Island’s $9,146 spend per person, based on fiscal 2017 spending, is more than 45% higher than the $6,279 federal average in the same year, according to the report. 
Andy Manca, chief of the state’s Office of Internal Audit, countered in an April 9 letter to lawmakers that the state would do better to continue its investments in existing audit and investigation functions, including the four new employees to staff an office of program integrity.
Nardone’s bill also drew written support from the Association of Inspectors General, while the the Narragansett Bay Commission opposed both Nardone and Lima’s bills, citing the cost to the 350,000 residential customers served by its two wastewater treatment operations if forced to comply with additional oversight regulations.

Public access in question
Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island, did not take a position, but offered several revisions meant to ensure that records, reports and other information kept by an inspector general’s office be subject to the state’s public records law. Both Nardone and Lima’s bills, as written, would keep inspector general’s records confidential and not public “unless it is necessary for the inspector general to make such records public in the performance of their duties.”
Lima, however, said her intent was to only keep records confidential while investigations and audits are being conducted; any finished work should be subject to public review, she said in an interview after the hearing.
“The whole point of this is that the public wants transparency,” she said. 
Both Lima and Nardone’s bills were held for further study Wednesday, the standard practice for an initial vetting by lawmakers.

The goal of “NC Housing Day” is to make housing a top priority for elected officials as they develop the state’s two-year budget and legislative priorities for the rest of the year, advocates said during a press conference on Bicentennial Plaza.

“We’re here talking to them [lawmakers] about funding housing and how these investments have to meet the scale of the need because currently, they do not,” said Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, director of housing policy for the N.C. Housing Coalition.
Advocates also spoke with lawmakers about equitable disaster recovery funding and removing barriers to land use and development, Watkins-Cruz said.
“We’re making sure that they know that they have the power to protect homeowners and renters,” she said. “There’s so much work to be done and the folks in this building [the Legislative Building] that we’ve elected have the power to make a lot of good change.”
Samuel Gunter, executive director of the Housing Coalition, said there are 1.1 million families in North Carolina who are burdened by housing costs. According to the group’s annual County Profiles, 48% of renters and 19% of homeowners in North Carolina pay more than 30% of their income on housing. Families that spend more than 30% of income on housing are considered cost-burdened.
“There are a lot of things that make housing and its affordability really complicated, but at its core, we’re talking about a very simple math problem that has two variables; how much does your housing cost and how much does your household make?” Gunter said. “That math gets impossible the further down you go on the income spectrum.”

Making the math work for low-income families is a challenge for housing advocates everywhere, Gunter said.
“We believe that every North Carolinian deserves access to safe, stable and affordable housing,” Gunter said. “It’s foundational to educational success, to economic stability, to well-being and investing in that housing means supporting those families and individuals and local economies and ensuring our communities thrive.”
Paul Reeves, interim president and CEO of Habitat for Humanity of North Carolina, said rising costs are pricing many families out of the housing market.
“Today many North Carolinians struggle to afford a safe place to call home and if they have a safe place to call home, they’re struggling to stay in that safe place to call home,” Reeves said.

He said the Housing Day event gave advocates an opportunity to amplify the need for strong affordable housing initiatives and policies and to brainstorm with lawmakers about how to tackle the housing crisis in North Carolina.
The state is facing a five-year housing inventory gap of 764,478 units (322,360 rental units and 442,118 for-sale units), according to a recent statewide report commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation, NC REALTORS and the N.C. Homebuilders Association.
Homeless advocates take aim at bills
Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness, said one representative asked her if she knows how many people are struggling with housing because of mental illness or drug addiction.
“My response to that representative was that I think we need to invert the question,” Agard said. “The truth of the matter is that when people are housed, they are able to manage so many of the things that we consider to be detriments to our health.”
Agard said the trauma of homelessness exacerbates underlying issues a person may have.
“That trauma leads to the other traumas people experience like increased mental illness or instability, like increased use of controlled substances or other things,” Agard said.
The solutions, she said, are an adequate supply of affordable housing and wraparound services to address addiction and mental health issues.
Agard noted that the Coalition to End Homelessness is advocating against House Bill 437, which establishes so-called drug-free homeless service zones and increases the punishment for committing certain drug offenses in such zones. The operators of facilities in such zones would also be subject to criminal charges and fines for violations, she said.
“I think this is unconscionable because it places an unfair burden on those facilities to increase security, to figure out what this means, to reestablish relationships that are trustworthy within the community,” Agard said.
HB 437 is cosponsored by Republicans Heather Rhyne of Lincoln County, Allen Chesser of Nash County and Ray Pickett of Watauga County.
The Coalition to End Homelessness also opposes Senate Bill 724, which would prohibit “unauthorized street camping in public parks, rights-of-way, and other public spaces.”
“It’s very important that we understand that the solution is not to sweep people out of encampments and place them in a designated area with no resources simply so they can be out of sight and out of mind,” Agard said. “What we need is more affordable housing. What we need are wraparound services. What we need is compassion for those who are the least in our community.”
SB 724 was filed by Republican Senators Ted Alexander of Cleveland County, Brad Overcash of Gaston County and Mike Lazzara or Onslow County.
Counties or municipalities that do not comply with the law would not receive state funds for homelessness assistance, prevention or services.
“The General Assembly recognizes the risk presented by unauthorized street camping, including conduct that results in the proliferation of drugs and drug paraphernalia, threats of random acts of violence, and the spread of disease and detritus, a section of the bill reads. “It is the intention of the General Assembly to protect the people of the State of North Carolina in public spaces and rights-of-way by enacting a prohibition on unauthorized camping in public spaces.”
A similar Republican-backed bill filed last week — House Bill 781 — would make it unlawful for local governments to allow or authorize any person to “regularly engage in public camping or sleeping on public property, including, but not limited to, public buildings or grounds and any public right-of-way.”
HB 781 provides an exception that would allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property located within its jurisdiction to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.”
“The criminalization of homelessness, even if unintentional, really is not addressing the problem,” Watkins-Cruz said during the Housing Coalition’s weekly housing call. “We need to be focusing on preventive solutions that meet the need rather than on outdated and ineffective policies that are actually more expensive and do not address the problem, which is access to safe and affordable housing.”
Critics believe that HB 781 is backed by the Cicero Institute out of Texas, which has supported such bills in other states. The institute was founded by billionaire tech entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale, who has been critical of what he contends is a “homeless industrial complex” whose members he alleges don’t want to end homelessness in order to keep their jobs.
HB 781 is cosponsored by four Republicans — Reps. Brian Biggs, Neal Jackson, Jennifer Balkcom and Mike Schietzelt — who represent parts of Randolph, Moore, Henderson, and Wake counties.
Under the bill, counties or municipalities designating property for encampments must establish and maintain minimum stands and procedures designed to:

Ensure the safety and security of the designated property and the persons lodging or residing on the property.
Maintain sanitation, including, at a minimum, by providing access to clean and operable restrooms and running water.
Coordinate with the county health department to provide access to behavioral health services, which must include substance abuse and mental health treatment resources.
Prohibit illegal substance use and alcohol use on the designated property and enforce the prohibition against such use.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4259-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-10 06:07:05.815396

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). A new Ohio higher education bill being signed into law has led one Cleveland State University student to decide to transfer to a New York university next semester. College students and professors alike say Ohio will lose talent because of the new law.
Dylan Repertorio, 19, started applying to universities outside of Ohio as Senate Bill 1 moved through the legislature. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law on March 28. 
The new law will ban diversity efforts, regulate classroom discussion, prohibit faculty strikes, and regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, among other things. The law is set to take effect in June and Ohio students, faculty, and staff are bracing for the impact. 
“Why should I contribute to a school in Ohio that isn’t going to let me learn about the things I want to learn?” Repertorio said.  “… I want the freedom to explore topics like foreign policy. I want to be able to talk about things that are political. This bill is an attack on everything that is within social sciences.”

Repertorio, a sophomore studying organizational leadership, is originally from New York so he will be returning to his home state to continue his higher education in Albany, New York. 
“I can’t rationalize spending all this money on education that is so limited,” he said. “It’s a really sick and evil game of chess and higher education, and I don’t want to play that game with mine.”
Repertorio was originally drawn to Cleveland when it came time for him to pick a college back when he was in high school.   
“I love Cleveland,” he said. “I wanted to experience something different. I wanted new opportunities. I wanted some different people.”
  Dylan Repertorio, 19, is transferring from Cleveland State University to a New York university next semester after Ohio Senate Bill 1 was signed into law. (Provided photo).
He wishes he didn’t have to leave Ohio, but is worried S.B. 1 is the first of more changes to come to Ohio higher education. 
“It’s only going to get worse,” Repertorio said. “There’s going to be more limitations. Professors are going to leave.”
John O’Keefe, president of Ohio University’s American Association of University Professors chapter, said this new law will make it harder for professors to teach and for universities to recruit top faculty. 
“It’s going to hurt Ohio down the road,” he said. 
Faculty, staff, and students at Ohio’s public universities are waiting to see how their university implements the new law. 
“We’re waiting anxiously to see what steps the university leadership takes,” O’Keefe said. “I think people are still very concerned and they’re not sure what the future holds.”
Ohio University President Lori Gonzalez said she does not anticipate that the new law will impact course offerings. 
“The Provost and I remain committed to academic freedom and will support your faculty as they provide instruction on a wide variety of topics, including topics that may be controversial in nature as defined by this law,” she said in a letter this week to the university. 
O’Keefe said he has heard some faculty talking about starting to look for jobs outside of Ohio. 
“People here are so passionate about their mission,” he said. “It’s not an easy decision to make to look for a job elsewhere, but … they have to think about ensuring that they know that they have the freedom to engage, the freedom to research.” 
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill into law banning diversity and inclusion at Texas public universities in 2023 and Texas Faculty Association President Pat Heintzelman said that has caused faculty to not want to work in Texas. 
“We’re losing so much talent,” Heintzelman said. 
She said the law has created a chilling effect for faculty. 
“I’m scared to teach anything that might be offensive to somebody,” Heintzelman said.
Audrey Ansel is preparing for Ohio University’s Pride Center to likely close as a result of the law. Ohio University has not explicitly said the Pride Center will close. 
“There’s just been a lot of frustration and sadness, but also a very strong commitment to preserving the resources in the center and moving them out into the community so that we’re not starting from zero,” she said.
For now, though, the Pride Center remains open. 
“University leadership is working to fully understand both the letter and intent of the law as it relates to the section on diversity, equity and inclusion offices and staff,” Gonzalez said in her letter. “We are also communicating with other universities across the state to ensure our understanding aligns with that of other institutions. We know changes will likely need to be made, and we want to ensure those changes reflect an accurate interpretation of the law.”
The Pride Center was a big reason Ansel came to OU. She works at the Pride Center and is worried about finding a new job for her senior year. 
“I just loved working at the Pride Center and getting to just be in that space with other people,” she said. “I think I’m going to feel a little bit lost without that structure and without that community that I’m so used to having.”
On top of that, she is also nervous about what else will be different come fall semester. 
“I wonder what conversation is going to look like in the classroom,” she said. “I am worried it’s going to be very different from the last three years.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Timothy Tweedie, superintendent and principal of the Veazie Community School, said he’d seen an uptick in students entering the kindergarten with unmet special education needs in recent years, and wanted to get a jump on addressing that. 
So last year, the school became part of the first cohort of districts to take over responsibility for providing special education services to preschoolers with disabilities, as the state began its process to implement that change broadly over the next four years. 
Tweedie shared his experience during a presentation to the Education Committee Wednesday about the changes with Child Development Services, the quasi-independent agency that in recent years was failing to meet many young students’ special education needs. 
In response, the state passed a law last session shifting the responsibility of identifying and educating children between the ages of 3 and 5 away from CDS and to individual districts.
“Some of our earliest learners were not receiving the services that they really needed before they were school age, and so we’re playing catch up with several students,” said Tweedie, whose district is among 17 now working with the Maine Department of Education to implement those changes. 
Students’ progress in these district-run programs has exceeded expectations, said Debrajean Scheibel, the special education director at Veazie Community School. The 163-student school was anticipating three preschoolers with Individualized Education Programs, designed to meet the needs of special education students under federal law, but nine students eventually signed up. 
“The most amazing thing for us is the parents of these early childhood children are so grateful that they are finally getting services,” Scheibel said. “They don’t wait a month, three months, or maybe a year.” 
“They are getting the evaluations completed in a timely manner, and we have staff that can provide the services today.” 
Assessing the shift to schools
Because of staffing challenges and other issues, CDS was struggling to meet its legal obligation to provide services for young students with disabilities before they entered school, creating an increasing number of kindergarteners with unmet needs. Many parents of young children were waiting on waitlists for months or years to get services, even after being identified by doctors as needing special education.
The agency’s system was “problematic,” according to Sandy Flacke, deputy director for the Office of Special Services within the Maine Department of Education, which advocated to shift that role to districts.
Families of young children say state failing to provide special education support

The first cohort included districts from Aroostook to York counties, although none of the state’s largest districts were part of the initial group. The department met with districts weekly to develop a plan to follow in collaboration with CDS, which still has some involvement, according to the update. The law gives the state until 2028 to transfer all responsibility to districts. In the meantime, CDS will keep filling in gaps as more districts roll out these services.
According to Flacke as well as associate commissioner of public education Megan Welter, the first cohort has seen significant progress and the second, which is starting this year, will build on that with larger districts participating. At the start of the 2045-25 school year, there were 153 children with Individualized Education Programs across all 17 cohort districts, and according to the most recent count, that number is now 309. That means schools have identified more young students with needs and are working with parents and specialists to meet them.
The department has developed a funding formula, established to cover 100% of costs at the state level, which has kept up with increasing enrollment. The department told lawmakers they’ve also established parental advisory committees to provide feedback on the shift so far, which will help with the addition of the next cohort and is offering technical support to districts.
Scott Reuning, director of special services at MSAD 35, which serves Eliot and South Berwick, said even before joining the first cohort his district had a strong PreK program with staff experienced in offering special education services. Like Veazie, the district got more students than expected, with 55 current students and four more referred to PreK special education services.
“Once our parents got wind of the school district providing the services, the frustration that people had experienced before was removed, and so the referrals are coming more quickly. I didn’t anticipate that,” he said. But the program is going well, and the results are evident, Reuning said.
“When I see a student with a significant disability walk into a building in September and not be able to function, and a month later they’re making progress, that is nice to see, and especially at such a young age.”

Many North Carolinians have been rightfully angered in recent months by Republican efforts to overturn Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin’s election loss to Justice Alison Riggs by seeking to throw out thousands of legally cast ballots. But sadly, there are other equally treacherous efforts underway.
The most obvious are bills from GOP lawmakers that slash the powers of two Democrats who won convincing victories last fall – Gov. Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson.
Rather than respecting the will of the voters, Republicans have sought to, in effect, overturn their decisions by seizing powers long assigned to those offices.
But wait, it gets worse.
Lawmakers are also seeking to transform the state auditor – an obscure office long held by a series of apolitical accountants – into a powerhouse with unprecedented duties. The reason: simple, a Republican won last fall.
The bottom line: North Carolina voters had no inkling of these radical changes when they cast their ballots last November, and by pursuing them now, Republicans are once again thumbing their noses at them.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)The final draft of the Ohio House version of the state operating budget included some changes to their initial plans for child care, but no change to the eligibility for its Publicly Funded Child Care program.
The omnibus budget amendment, released Tuesday and passed by the House on Wednesday, added $50 million in funding for each fiscal year to support the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, using federal funding from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. The voucher program provides a subsidy for children whose income falls outside of the eligibility for the state’s Publicly Funded Child Care.
In Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive budget, he wanted the PFCC eligibility raised to a maximum of 160% of the federal poverty line. The House, however, maintained the current level of 145% in both their initial draft and the omnibus draft passed on Wednesday.
The Ohio Department of Children and Youth’s director, Kara Wente, told the Senate Finance Committee the same day that the department estimates about 40,000 children live outside of the PFCC eligibility, making them eligible for the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, which has a current maximum eligibility of 200% of the federal poverty line.
With the Senate beginning work to create a budget draft of its own, Wente went on to say the child care voucher program, which was established in April of last year, has already served 5,300 families and 8,000 children.
The director said it’s important for the state to support the program as child care continues to be an issue not only for parents who lack access, but also those who lack the ability to afford child care, especially at higher poverty levels.
“We know that families up to 200% (of the federal poverty line) are making less than $62,000 a year, and we know the average cost of child care in Ohio is about $11 an hour,” Wente told the committee.
Ohio’s eligibility level is “the lowest in the country,” according to Wente, who continued to support the proposed expansion of publicly funded child care to 160% in the Senate committee.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Child care advocates have been pushing for improvements to Ohio’s child care sector for years, with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce most recently holding a summit about the impacts of child care on the state’s workforce.
The state chamber, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and Ohio-based advocacy group Groundwork Ohio, released a full report at the summit, laying out detailed impacts on the state’s economy, employment and education.
“Ohio’s child care gaps drive parents out of the workforce, reduce tax revenue for the state and put undue strain on households,” the report stated.
The February 2025 research found that “insufficient child care availability” costs Ohio $5.48 billion every year in lost economic activity.
That includes $1.52 billion lost in tax revenue due to “child care issues” and $3.97 billion in “child care-related employee turnover and absenteeism” costs.
The root of the issue, the report found, is low reimbursement rates for child care providers, along with low pay for those workers, and disproportionate distribution of providers, especially in rural areas.
“Ohio generally lags behind the rest of the Midwest when it comes to implementing policies to improve child care accessibility,” researchers stated in the report.
Maintaining the support for child care, particularly for children in families up to 200% of the federal poverty line is one of the top goals for Wente and the state’s Department of Children and Youth.
She also told the Senate the department wants to see the application process streamlined, and payments for providers streamlined as well. Federal compliance through the use of market rates for providers and capping co-pays for parents at 7% of their income are also top priorities for the department, according to the director.
Along with the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, the House’s version of the budget keeps the Early Childhood Education Grant Program proposed by the governor, “to support and invest in Ohio’s early learning and development programs,” according to budget documents. Those programs include licensed child care centers and preschools.
The budget draft also included $3.2 million for a “child care recruitment and mentorship program,” and Publicly Funded Child Care payments would be based on a child’s enrollment rather than attendance, if the provisions stay in the final draft of the budget.
Also still present in the House’s budget proposal is a child care cost-sharing model that would split the costs of care three ways, between the state, employers and employees. The omnibus budget amendments capped eligibility for that program at 400% of the federal poverty level.
Infant mortality and better outcomes
Wente said the department, which absorbed several other departments when it was established, is focused on meeting goals like child care access, along with lowering infant mortality rates and improving kindergarten readiness, even as the 600-person department commits to cutting 36 positions.
She wants to see the infant mortality rate in the state improve from the current ranking of 43rd in the country. Modeling the state’s programs on local measures like Cradle Cincinnati, Wente said a strategy that focuses on moms, connecting moms to resources and holding the state accountable for the outcomes would go a long way to continued improvement.
“What we’re seeing be common across all states (with lower infant mortality rates), no matter their makeup, is that they’re actually engaging with the families that are most at risk,” Wente said.
Ohio has great “foundational programs,” she said, but families need more assurances that they will be able to overcome burdens like poverty or a lack of transportation to get to those resources.
With changes in the department and proper budget support, Wente said they have plans to bring a rise in all outcomes for children, including in kindergarten readiness through accessible, affordable child care.
“We, today, know that based on Ohio data, that economically disadvantaged children are 2.4 times more likely to demonstrate on the kindergarten readiness assessment if they’ve had any involvement in preschool,” Wente said.
The House’s draft of the budget removes the kindergarten readiness assessment, along with its use on the state report card, and “related data collection and reported requirements.”
Wente was also asked about pediatric cancer funding in the state, which would see a $5 million reduction in funding as part of the House’s budget draft. The executive budget called for $10 million, which the director said would be used “to really work with our research institutions and our children’s hospital to figure out the best way to add to children’s cancer research.”
“Pediatric cancer research is one of the lowest-funded research components in the cancer space,” Wente said. “It’s predominantly focus on adults, so we wanted to take a targeted approach to make sure that there was focus on kids. That has been reduced to $5 million.”

Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita, appears during a March 24, 2025, session of the House (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)Being a Republican in Kansas means never having to say you’re sorry.
Not really. Sure, you might have to mumble a half-hearted apology or lose an election here or there. But don’t worry! You won’t face any sanctions with teeth or be out of office for long. Kansas Republicans embrace affirmative action for middle-aged, mediocre white men who believe the right things.
Take Rep. Nick Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita. Back in February, he found himself in a bit of a jam after confronting with Rep. Ford Carr, D-Wichita, on the House floor. Hoheisel, who is white, confronted Carr, who is Black, over Carr’s rhetoric. According to witnesses, the Republican used profanity. Carr later filed a formal complaint.
In our original coverage of events, Hoheisel appeared to deny that anything untoward had occurred.
“I’m not going to dignify any of those false and outlandish allegations with a response,” Hoheisel wrote editor Sherman Smith in a text message.
Yet Hoheisel eventually apologized to the House, while still claiming the allegation were “significantly overstated.”
A special committee made up of three Republicans and three Democrats looked into the complaint and deadlocked. Republican leaders lowered the boom on Carr, however, and subjected him to a multi-day ordeal before that same committee. His main sin appears to have been calling the GOP racist. The panel will potentially send a letter to the full House admonishing Carr.
Hoheisel escaped any discipline whatsoever.
That’s just for Democrats or saps.
Conservatives don’t pay a price for cursing at their opponents, losing high-profile races or an array of other bad behavior. Not in Kansas, they don’t.
State Sen. Virgil Peck once joked about shooting immigrants from helicopters. Then a representative, he issued a brief apology and kept serving. Eventually, he lost a primary for state Senate. But he worked his way into the chamber eventually, spreading nonsense about chivalrous manhood along the way.
Just this session, he criticized journalists’ “inaccurate” stories to justify raising the rent of press offices at the Statehouse.
Rep. Pat Proctor has left a trail of bellicosity and startling rhetoric about Kansas elections. Yet he’s now running to administer those same elections as secretary of state. A previous contender for that office, Mike Brown, failed in his 2022 bid to unseat elections chief Scott Schwab. Yet Brown simply pivoted to run for state GOP chairman the very next year — and won.
Senate President Ty Masterson went through bankruptcy and somehow found a six-figure job at Wichita State University to complement his legislative work. Nice work if you can get it, right? He’s likely to launch a gubernatorial bid soon.
The one and only Kris Kobach lost consecutive statewide elections to Gov. Laura Kelly in 2018 and Sen. Roger Marshall in 2020. He finally managed to claw his way back to relevancy through a successful bid for attorney general. Who knows where he might land next, but he clearly wasn’t daunted by Kansas voters’ repeated rejections. They don’t know what a good deal they have in voting for another subpar white man.
As I said, white male Republicans of a conservative bent can rest assured in their continued relevance, no matter controversies or losses.
The one person who appears to have paid a price for his shortcomings is House Majority Leader Gene Suellentrop, who was jailed on a drunk driving charge and ousted from his post in 2021. He stayed around the Statehouse through early 2023, though. Statehouse leaders didn’t want to look like they were too tough on the poor fellow, I suppose.
This year, we’ve heard repeatedly from those in Washington, D.C., that efforts to embrace diversity, equity and inclusion have gone too far.
We’ve heard repeated suggestions that prominent and accomplished Black people, women and LGBTQ+ community members don’t have what it takes. Marshall even suggested that DEI policies contributed to the crash of a passenger plane from Wichita.
Yet those in Topeka have shown us throughout recent years that the real threat doesn’t come from Black people, women or LGBTQ+ folks.
It comes from doughy white men who won’t take a hint to leave the rest of us alone.

To attract business investment, American cities and states offer companies billions of dollars in incentives, such as tax credits. As the theory goes, when governments create a business-friendly environment, it encourages investment, leading to job creation and economic growth.
While this theory may seem logical on its face, it’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. Business investment follows employees, not just the other way around. In fact, our research suggests workers care less about whether a city has business-friendly policies and more about how safe they feel living in it. And interestingly, we found that politics influence people’s risk perceptions more than hard data such as crime statistics.
Our findings have major implications for cities and businesses. If people choose where to live and work based on perceived safety rather than economic incentives, then entrepreneurs and city leaders may need to rethink how they approach growth and investment.
 The many faces of risk

We are management professors who surveyed more than 500 employees and entrepreneurs from across the country to better understand how they rate 25 large U.S. cities on various dimensions of risk.
We asked about three different types of risk: risk related to crime, government function and social issues. Risk related to government function includes corruption and instability, while risk related to social issues includes potential infringements on individual rights.
We found that people’s views of risk weren’t driven primarily by objective statistics, such as FBI crime data. Instead, they were shaped by factors such as media representations, word of mouth and geographic stereotypes.
For example, studies suggest that crime in Denver has been rising, and U.S. News and World Report recently ranked it as the 10th most dangerous city based on FBI crime reports. However, the employees and entrepreneurs we surveyed ranked Denver as the safest city in the country.

 It’s all politics

We found that political perspectives were the main factor biasing the rankings. For example, conservative-leaning employees and entrepreneurs believed that Portland, Oregon, is dangerous, ranking it as America’s ninth-riskiest city. In contrast, those who are liberal-leaning ranked it as the second-safest city in the country.
Both of these beliefs can’t be accurate. Instead, when basing the ranking on objective crime data from the FBI, U.S. News ranked Portland the 15th most dangerous city in the country.
When assessing risk related to how the government functions, conservatives praised politicians in Nashville, Charlotte and Dallas, while the liberals praised those in Denver, Minneapolis and Portland. Similarly, when considering risk related to social issues, conservatives said New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco were “risky,” while the liberals said Tampa, Miami and Houston should be avoided.
Our findings also suggest that political perspectives influence the types of risk that employers and employees care about. For example, conservatives tend to care more about crime-related risk than liberals, and liberals care more about risk related to social issues.
 Now what?

We’re not advocating that city leaders drop financial incentives altogether, or that employers ignore them. Evidence suggests that financial incentives and other business-friendly policies may be effective at attracting businesses and strengthening local economies.
However, our research suggests that when individuals are making important life decisions about where to live, work and invest, a city’s level of risk matters. Importantly, beliefs about risk are subjective and are biased by political perspectives.
In our view, city leaders must recognize and address concerns about crime, governance and social issues while actively working to improve public perceptions of their cities. Likewise, businesses may want to consider investing in cities that are less politically polarized when making investment decisions.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.










It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician


From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

President Donald Trump has launched an all-out legal attack on states’ authority to set climate change policy.
His executive order, issued Tuesday, directs the Department of Justice to challenge a huge swath of state laws and regulations. The order aims at measures that seek to cut carbon emissions, penalize energy companies and limit drilling permits. It also targets state-led lawsuits against fossil fuel companies over the damages caused by climate change.
Trump’s directive orders Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement” of any state laws related to climate change, including any that are seen as “burdening” the use of domestic energy resources. Such language could include state laws that mandate a transition to clean electricity sources.
The order specifically calls out “climate Superfund” policies in Vermont and New York, which require fossil fuel companies to pay for some of the damages caused by climate change. It also targets California’s cap-and-trade law, which places a limit on emissions through auctions of carbon credits.
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

While Trump’s order says such state policies are unconstitutional, climate-focused state leaders say his administration has no legal basis to unravel their efforts.
“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement from the U.S. Climate Alliance. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”
Hochul and Lujan Grisham co-chair the alliance, a coalition of 24 governors focused on reducing emissions.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Politico that the order is “toothless.”
“[Trump] has no authority on his own to nullify state laws,” he told the outlet.
But the order throws the might of the federal government into a sprawling legal battle over states’ authority to set climate policy and seek damages for disasters.
It could force states to face expensive litigation and years of legal uncertainty. Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and elsewhere have at times been hostile to environmental regulations. And it’s unclear whether the order will have a chilling effect on state efforts to craft more climate legislation.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Farmers Union)Folks can get animated when it comes to discussions of climate science and energy production. Rather than the facts alone, confirmation bias and ideological rigidity can creep in to one’s seemingly common-sense position.
For example, some argue against renewable energy by saying that currently accepted scientific theory on climate change is a “hoax” or a “scam.” These are loaded terms, not material to an actual argument against the current scientific consensus. Nor does such an accusation effectively argue against alternative energy sources.
Even granting that the current global consensus of climate experts is somehow an elaborate hoax, how would that negate the positive dividends of non-polluting renewable energy? The answer is it would not. The argument is irrelevant.
Truth matters
The truth is the opposite: rather than harmless, the burning of fossil fuels is indeed harmful to the environment and the health of living things. Don’t believe me? Go start your car and leave the garage door closed. (Don’t if you want to live.)
Another popular argument posits that government subsidies mask the true economic liability that is renewable energy. While this seems to fly in the face of the reality that the wind and sunlight are free (and infinite), it is true that Americans have some tax credits available for more efficient home energy infrastructure (such as rooftop solar, geothermal HVAC, etc.). And government has directly subsidized wind and energy projects at the commercial production level.
But if the idea is that government assistance proves the economic futility of an industry, oil and gas take the booby prize. According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. government ranks second in the world in its support of the oil and gas industry.
Per IMF, the U.S. federal and state governments give the fossil fuel industry over $20.5 billion in support each year through the tax code, inadequate royalty rates and direct funding. Also per the IMF, U.S. renewables were subsidized to the tune of $15.6 billion in FY 2022.
The truth is, all energy production types are subsidized in the United States, at various amounts and for various reasons.
Fact-based decisions
Still, we must ask: Is it possible to set political and ideological considerations aside and make smart, fact-based choices for our shared future of energy consumption and production in Nebraska?
Anyone who lives here knows Nebraska produces comparatively little oil and gas. According to the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy (NDEE), Nebraska’s crude oil production in 2021 was only 3.68% of the petroleum products consumed in the state. Nebraska’s natural gas production in 2021 was only 0.18% of the natural gas consumed in the state.
But we enjoy an abundance of wind and an enviable amount of sunshine. Needless to say, all or close to all of the solar and wind energy consumed in Nebraska is also produced in Nebraska. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), renewable resources (mostly wind) provided 32% of Nebraska’s total electricity net generation in 2023.
Among a wealth of energy choices, does it make sense, both economically and in terms of real environmental challenges, to argue that the only energy resource Nebraska is unable to produce in abundance — fossil fuels — should be the sole energy resource we rely on?
If we are to discourage Nebraskans from generating their own clean — and virtually free — energy, shouldn’t we be certain that abandoning the pursuit of that free energy resource is a wise thing to do?
Renewables worth it
So far, I have heard no good arguments against continued expansion of renewable energy resources. Yes, wind and solar require infrastructure (just like oil and gas). Yes, the industry is subsidized (just like oil and gas). Yes, there is environmental impact (just like oil and gas). And yes, there are
taxpayer-funded incentives (just like oil and gas).
The worst argument, in my opinion, tries to hobble renewables for being “intermittent.” What do we do at night or when the wind stops blowing? A rooftop solar system can feed extra power back to the grid on a sunny day, then switch to pulling from the grid at night. During a cloudy, windless February, we burn some coal or other fuel to keep the lights on, then reap the March winds and the summer sun.
The answer is, we use them all. But the more renewables we use, the longer “all” energy sources —including finite ones like oil and gas — will be available. How does that not makes sense?

A study says metro areas elsewhere are more pro-housing.","Overwhelmingly Californians rate the intertwined issues of housing supply, living costs and homelessness as the state’s most pressing issues, as a recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California confirms.
The terrible trio, as one might term it, also draws constant verbal acknowledgement from the state’s politicians, from Gov. Gavin Newsom down, and he and legislators have enacted dozens, perhaps hundreds, of measures to address it.
Nevertheless there’s little evidence that their efforts have had material impact. Either the three situations are beyond the capacity of politics to address — a distinct possibility — or the political efforts to date have not been vigorous enough.
Why, one must wonder, is California plagued while residents of other states enjoy lower housing and living costs and experience much lower rates of homelessness? Shouldn’t our political and civic leaders be examining what these other states are doing right, or are they so afflicted with self-righteous hubris that they cannot entertain such a thought?
A new and very detailed study of housing policies in the nation’s 250 largest metropolitan areas confirms that California is an outlier when it comes to increasing housing supply and moderating its costs.
Titled “BUILD HOMES, EXPAND OPPORTUNITY,” the report is a product of the George W. Bush Institute at Southern Methodist University.
“America’s fastest-growing cities offer lessons on how America can address its housing affordability crisis,” the report declares. “Based on our analysis of the 250 largest metropolitan areas and a deep dive into 25 large metros in the Sun Belt and Mountain states, places scoring best for pro-growth housing and land-use policies are mostly large Sun Belt metros from the Carolinas through Texas to Utah.”
The metros doing the best job of meeting their housing demands, the report says, have policies that make it easy for developers to build. That includes allowing higher-density housing in “substantial fractions of every city,” reducing minimum lot sizes, allowing residential construction in commercial areas, reducing or eliminating parking requirements and embracing innovative technologies such as modular construction and 3D printing.
In addition to adopting specific housing policies that spur development, the report continues, metros that are meeting demand also pursue complementary policies, such as having enough educational and medical services, allowing  “fine-grained mixing of land uses and human activities in as many places as possible,” allowing “dynamic changes in land use rather than trying to freeze neighborhoods,” and providing amenities such as “walkability, revitalized live-work-play downtowns” and “great parks and trails.”
So, one might ask, which metro areas are hitting all the right buttons and which are not, as determined in the study?
The 25 top pro-housing metros are all either in the Sun Belt — particularly Texas, California’s arch-rival — or in the mountain states such as Utah and Idaho. No. 1 is Charlotte, NC. and No. 2 is Austin, the Texas capital which is becoming a powerful competitor with California’s Silicon Valley.
Not surprisingly, California metros are heavily represented on the list of the nation’s 25 “most restrictive” metros. While Honolulu is the least accommodating, Oxnard is No. 2. 
Nine of the 25 are in California. They include, in order after Oxnard, San Jose, San Diego, Riverside-San Bernardino, San Francisco, Sacramento, Bakersfield, Fresno and Stockton.
It would be tempting to dismiss the Bush Institute’s report as biased because it comes from Texas, but it contains a wealth of detail and explains how the data were evaluated.
A better response from California politicians would be to read the report and determine what more California could do to make the state housing-friendly. The state’s current path on housing, other living costs and homelessness is going in the wrong direction.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/061523-Fresno-Housing-LV_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

As a Black woman with Crohn’s disease, she worries PDAB could exacerbate existing health disparities.","A pharmacist counts out pills for a prescription in this 2024 file photo. (Photo by Senior Airman Thomas Karol/U.S. Air Force)I had hoped voices like mine – a Black woman with Crohn’s disease – would still have impact in the state of Maryland. Yet, there seems to be little concern that Maryland’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board may reduce access to care for those already experiencing health disparities. The legislature created the board to make drugs more affordable – though to whom is still an open question.
I founded a nonprofit representing patients like me, Color of Gastrointestinal Illnesses, based on my own personal experience. I have been on 16 medications, from pills to injections to suppositories. I started having rectal bleeding at age 13, yet was not diagnosed with Crohn’s disease until 2018, after a 30-year journey. And even with diagnosis, I did not get an advanced therapy prescribed until five years later.
That medication changed my life. Yet, I also recognize that I have a progressive disease and my health has been forever impacted by a delayed diagnosis and delayed prescribing of the advanced therapy I needed.
Based on my experience and so many like me, I worry the activities of the Maryland Prescription Drug Affordability Board will exacerbate existing health disparities. In this age of personalized medicine, clinicians can prescribe treatment based on evidence of clinical effectiveness based on personal characteristics. Drugs do not have the same impact on different patients, and policies should not allow physicians to be steered by payers into prescribing decisions. Insurers are not doctors.

Patients face a flurry of threats to our access to health care in Congress right now, giving state policymakers an opening to slide past us what they might call policy tweaks or simple data collection to inform payer decisions.
Yet, any patient that has fought for coverage of their treatment knows that the policies governing payers really matters. What sounds good to save the system money does not translate into affordability and access for patients and people with disabilities. Adding to the insult, the Maryland legislature passed legislation to expand the reach of the state’s Prescription Drug Affordability Board to the commercial insurance market.
We all want drugs to be accessible and affordable. Patients like me are literally fighting for their lives to achieve policies that allow them to receive care prescribed by their doctors without the barriers of utilization management, such delayed treatment due to prior authorizations, step therapy forcing patients to fail on a treatment before accessing what their doctors prescribe, and nonmedical switching at the pharmacy to a different drug.
Patients pay for the mistakes of insurers that impose their judgement about medical treatment – based largely on cost effectiveness and not clinical effectiveness – in the form of costly adverse medical events or by having to pay out-of-pocket for denied care they know they need.
When patients have raised concerns that this Board’s decisions may trigger insurers to change their formularies and raise costs to patients, there has been no serious consideration of the issue other than a commitment to monitor and study it. We all know what that means – nothing.
We have also shared concerns individually and as coalitions that the board’s work may conflict with the laws governing disability nondiscrimination, which bars their use of measures of cost effectiveness known to devalue people with serious, disabling and chronic conditions like mine. In response, a board member bluntly stated it was better to have more data than less and expressed intent to collect data using the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure to value treatments.
The board did not acknowledge the QALY is known to devalue disabled lives and is barred from use by federal law to make decisions in programs such as Medicaid. It was developed for the purpose of rationing care in other countries, which does not bode well for the disproportionate share of people of color that have disabling conditions or older adults.
The National Council on Disability is an independent federal agency advising Congress and the states on disability policy. It has consistently recommended against use of QALYs and similar measures, including by reference to other countries.
The question now is whether the board will pause its work and listen to people like me about what really drives our affordability challenges.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/8368696-1024x502.jpg,,,2025-04-10 09:10:09.221953

Danielle Gaines/Maryland MattersAtlanta-based Delta Air Lines canceled earlier projections of record annual profits this week, with CEO Ed Bastian instead warning investors that the airline is canceling expansion plans and preparing for a recession.
“We’re in uncharted, unprecedented uncertainty when you look at what has happened,” Bastian said, calling it “a self-inflicted situation.” 
“Until we get better clarity (from the Trump administration),” Bastian said, “I think our economy is going to continue to lose steam.”
The chaos in Washington and the carnage on Wall Street are also being felt in other ways in Georgia, with retirement accounts depleted, federal workers left jobless and companies large and small forced to reconsider business models that were designed for an economy that is being purposefully dismantled. 
In early March, for example, the Georgia Port Authority announced another major expansion of its massive auto-import facility in Brunswick, which is already the second busiest in the nation. According to the GPA, one in 10 jobs in the area now depend upon the port, which is being expanded to store up to 1.4 million vehicles before they’re shipped to dealers inland.
When I drove by the port last week, a huge car carrier was unloading and the storage lots seemed full. That’s no surprise — foreign automakers have been rushing shipments to the United States in an attempt to get their product into the country before tariffs are imposed. 
However, if Donald Trump’s economic plan has the impact on imports that he claims to want, those lots could be almost empty in a few weeks or months, and the expansion plan should be canceled.
If we do end up in a recession, it won’t be an accidental recession or the type of natural recession that comes at the end of a growth cycle. As Bastian noted, it will be a recession that Trump forced upon us with a nonsensical economic policy. And since his fellow Republicans have been too intimidated or infatuated by Trump to try to intercede, they too will own the political repercussions, which could be broad and deep.
Even before this upheaval, the 2026 election cycle seemed promising for Georgia Democrats. Mid-term elections tend to favor parties out of power, and a popular Republican governor, Brian Kemp, will be leaving office next year. And while Trump has shown the ability to draw casual voters to the polls when his name is on the ballot, he hasn’t been able to generate that same turnout from his base in mid-terms. 
Take that situation, throw a recession on top of it and you have the makings of a transitional election in Georgia.
In short, if Democrats choose well, I think the stage is set for a 2026 election season in which Georgia elects its first Democratic governor in a generation, and perhaps other statewide officers as well. (The state Legislature is too well-gerrymandered to turn in a single election.) 
The Democratic gubernatorial field has yet to take shape for ’26, but we already have a pretty good idea of what the GOP campaign will look like. In the primary, Attorney General Chris Carr, an ally of Kemp and someone viewed as a Trump skeptic by Republican standards, will be running against Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Trump supporter so avid that he served as a “fake elector” in 2020. Jones, a state senator at the time, also demanded that the state Legislature be called into special session to override Georgia voters and give the state to Trump.
Jones hopes to use Trump as a wedge in the 2026 primary campaign, reminding Republican voters that his support for the president has been absolute while Carr’s has been more situational. Given the ferocious loyalty of many GOP voters to Trump, maybe that will work, even if the economy turns sour, but in a general election it would likely be fatal.
Even if Carr wins the nomination, the GOP brand may be so toxic, and the party so divided, that a Republican victory becomes unlikely. But failure on the scale that we seem to be courting has to have its consequences.

It supports more than $1.7 billion in annual economic activity and over 6,500 maritime jobs in the state.","I’ve spent my career in the maritime industry, working with several shipping companies across Puerto Rico. Born and raised on the island, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to its port operations for decades. 
Today, I serve as Vice President and General Manager of McAllister Towing in Puerto Rico. From this vantage point, I’ve seen how vital the Jones Act is —not only to the maritime workforce, but to price stability, supply reliability, and the economic health of both Puerto Rico and states like Connecticut.
The Connecticut General Assembly is currently considering a resolution urging Congress to amend the Jones Act “to improve economic and trade relations between the state of Connecticut and Puerto Rico.” While I share the goal of strengthening that connection, weakening the Jones Act would do the opposite. It would undermine the framework that has supported opportunity and reliable trade between our regions for generations.
McAllister Towing, with over 160 years of continuous American ownership, has operated in Puerto Rico for more than 50 years. In that time, we’ve provided stable, well-paying maritime careers to generations of Puerto Rican mariners —jobs protected by the Jones Act. These aren’t short-term roles; they’re long-term careers that support local families and the island’s economy.
But the Jones Act is about more than employment. It delivers critical operational and economic advantages that often go unrecognized.
Unlike many foreign carriers, Jones Act operators are fully integrated into the U.S. intermodal logistics system. We use 45-, 48-, and 53-foot containers —larger than the international 40-foot standard— so more cargo moves per trip, reducing per-unit transportation costs. These savings are real, and they benefit Puerto Rican businesses and consumers.
Schedule reliability is another key strength. Jones Act carriers offer multiple sailings per week, with on-time arrivals measured in hours, not days. That consistency enables businesses in Puerto Rico to manage leaner inventories, reduce warehouse space, and lower property tax exposure —leading to more efficient, cost-effective operations.
Another major benefit is rate stability. During the pandemic, international container rates surged —from about $3,000 to over $25,000. In contrast, Jones Act carriers kept rates stable, helping protect Puerto Rican businesses from the chaos seen in global shipping. Predictable rates matter —especially for small and mid-sized importers.
Critics claim the Jones Act raises consumer prices in Puerto Rico. But that argument doesn’t hold up. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found no clear evidence that the Jones Act increases retail prices. Shipping costs are a small part of what consumers pay. Far more impactful are Puerto Rico’s high utility costs, which drive up overhead across food storage, refrigeration, and distribution.
We’ve also seen what happens when the Jones Act doesn’t apply. In parts of the Caribbean, inter-island shipping jobs have increasingly gone to foreign mariners from countries with lower wages and limited protections. Without the Jones Act, Puerto Rican seafarers would likely face the same displacement.
Beyond economics, the Jones Act is vital to national security. It ensures only U.S.-built, -owned, and -crewed vessels transport cargo between U.S. ports—keeping our domestic supply chain under American control. During the pandemic and other periods of global disruption, this capability proved essential—not just symbolic.
Connecticut also has a stake in preserving the Jones Act. It supports more than $1.7 billion in annual economic activity and over 6,500 maritime jobs in the state. Weakening it would open U.S. trade routes to foreign operators, undercut American workers, and weaken the maritime industry both states rely on.
Connecticut is right to pursue stronger trade with Puerto Rico—but dismantling the Jones Act is not the way to do it. It won’t reduce prices. It will offshore jobs, destabilize local supply chains, and leave U.S. commerce exposed to foreign volatility.
The Jones Act works. It creates jobs, keeps costs stable, and ensures reliable delivery of goods across the U.S. and its territories. Rather than weaken it, we should protect and strengthen the system it upholds.

This year’s theme, Connecting < KINSHIP > Healing, is a call-to-action to recognize the shared humanity that should be at the center of support for crime victims and survivors.
A recent change in law (Public Act 24-5) in Connecticut recognizes the humanity involved in connecting victims with assistance for crime-related financial impacts. Previously, victims needed to choose between two state agencies for assistance. Now, thanks to a recent change in law, victims can receive assistance from both programs, with the intention of lessening crime’s financial toll.

Erin Choquette and Marc Pelka
There were 30,354 reported violent crimes in Connecticut in 2023. Every crime uniquely affected a victim. Experiencing a violent crime can be highly traumatic, with physical, emotional, spiritual, and financial impacts rippling for years after the incident. If victims must miss work and lose wages because of crime, financial insecurity can make the trauma even more acute, placing recovery further out of reach.
The Victim Compensation Program, which is directed by the Judicial Branch Office of Victim Services (JB-OVS), provides financial assistance for out-of-pocket expenses for victims of crime based on application eligibility. Benefits include help with medical, dental, and mental health bills, lost wages, and expenses associated with crime scene cleanup, security systems and funerals. Maximum benefits are based on the type of crime.
CT Paid Leave provides up to 12 weeks of wage replacement benefits to workers who need time away from work to recover from their own serious health condition or other family or health needs, like welcoming a new child or caring for a seriously ill family member. Twelve days of CT Paid Leave benefits are available to workers dealing with specific situations arising from family violence or sexual assault as outlined in the CT Family Violence Leave Act. Additionally, a longer duration of income replacement benefits is available for crime victims who experience a resulting serious health condition and need ongoing physical or mental health care treatment and recovery.
The new law, which took effect last October, clears the way for JB-OVS and CT Paid Leave to work collaboratively to mitigate crime victims’ wage losses. JB-OVS now can pay for wage loss concurrently with CT Paid Leave, so long as the victim qualifies for paid leave and the total benefit does not exceed the victim’s regular pay rate or provide duplicative assistance. It enables victims to access a wider array of benefits, combine complementary benefits, and receive longer wage replacement assistance.
Let’s examine a few situations in which CT Paid Leave and the Victim Compensation Program would work together. One scenario would be where a victim receives wage replacement benefits from CT Paid Leave and assistance with out-of-pocket medical expenses from the Victim Compensation Program. This combination of benefits provides victims with time for their injuries to heal while receiving prescribed medical treatment. 
Under a second scenario, because of the severity of the crime-related injury a victim may need to supplement CT Paid Leave’s maximum 12 weeks of leave with additional weeks of coverage from the Victim Compensation Program. Imagine a victim with a physically demanding job who experienced a severe physical assault that requires a longer recovery time before a safe return to work is feasible. 
Under a third scenario, a victim’s net income exceeds the maximum allowable benefit under CT Paid Leave policy. The victim could receive additional wage loss benefits from the Victim Compensation Program, up to their average net income, and fill the gap in wage loss. This could help stabilize the victim’s personal or family income while life-changing physical injuries are dealt with. 
The new law has other benefits to help victims. It extends provisions already in place for family violence victims to sexual assault survivors. Like family violence victims, an employee who is a sexual assault victim may take leave to seek medical care or counseling, relocate, to seek services from a victim services organization, or participate in civil or criminal proceedings related to or resulting from the assault.
The change in law launches greater collaboration between two state entities committed to helping restore a sense of agency among crime victims. The shared goal is to empower victims to access a wider array of allowable benefits that are more responsive to the amount of financial assistance needed, the severity of the crime, and the types of financial losses experienced.

Young people.
Many are the children of immigrants, some are documented, some not, but they have all stepped up to testify at hearings, lead letter-writing campaigns, distribute know-your-rights cards on street corners and spread the word on social media.

They helped with what Martinez knew going in would be a rough legislative session for immigrant rights.
While advocates were able to win protections dealing with immigration agents at places like schools, hospitals and houses of worship, and another blocking agents’ access to state databases without a warrant, they were not able to get restrictions on so-called 287(g) agreements between local police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. With minutes to go until the end of the session Monday night, House members agreed to drop the 287(g) language in a dispute with the Senate so they could preserve the rest of the package.

“While we were not able to advance a full prohibition on the 287(g) program this year, we are proud to have passed Sensitive Locations guidance and Data Privacy Protection through an amended HB1222 Maryland Values Act,” he said. “These victories, though partial, represent steps forward in our continued fight for immigrant justice.”
Broad coalition drives legislative support
Alex Vazquez, Maryland organizing director for CASA, the leading immigrant advocacy group in the region, immigrant rights groups knew right after the election of President Donald Trump the “we were going to get straight to work to combat this anti-immigrant campaign that this administration was running.”
“We [saw] a lot of young people were already out there responding to the call to action,” Vazquez said.
Luz Chavez-Gonzales is a former Maryland youth organizer with United We Dream, a national immigrant-led network in the United States that focuses on empowering youth. She came to this country from Bolivia in 2002, when she was 4. As a recipient of the deferred deportation protections in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), she says she remains undocumented, but undeterred.
Chavez-Gonzales was called on by high school students in a single Montgomery County school during the COVID-19 pandemic to help them organize Friends of Asylum and Immigration Reform, or F.A.I.R., into a virtual community.
“I’m here to build those networks,” she said, seeing herself in those she mentors. “It’s just amazing to see the change that I wanted to see when I was in high school, and they are doing it now.”
F.A.I.R. grows, offers strength in numbers
Today, F.A.I.R. has student representatives in every Montgomery County high school. Their membership is largely immigrant or the children of immigrants, who have partnered with CASA on immigrant issues and organized support among their peers.

Watkins Mill High School junior Teresa Espinoza, a F.A.I.R. vice president, is the daughter of immigrants from Peru, who came to the U.S. as teenagers to support their families. Their status remains undocumented, she says, which has galvanized her actions.
“I knew it [immigrant protections] was something that was not only going to affect my family, but also my friends at school,” she said. “And so together, we lobbied our [state] delegates and senators, had some of our [F.A.I.R.] members submit testimony.”
F.A.I.R.’s networking and membership director Senaya Asfaw was born in the United States. Her parents fled Ethiopia to escape the political turmoil there in early 2000s. She is a junior at Montgomery Blair, the county’s largest high school and among its most diverse, with Latino, African American and Asian students accounting for 77% of its enrollment.
Asfaw headed to Annapolis to voice their fears about reports of ICE agents outside their school and a nearby church.
“They are scared because ICE might come to their school and take away everything they have been working toward. No child should have to choose between education and safety,” Asfaw told legislators in support of the Sensitive Locations Act, that eventually passed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Aya Kouadio also made the trip to testify. A senior at Clarksville High School, she is F.A.I.R.’s social media manager. Born in the Ivory Coast, her family moved to Tunisia, and then to the United States to seek medical care for her brother.
She says F.A.I.R.’s Instagram account has more than 1,500 followers, with one recent post that detailed ICE sightings reaching 30,000 views.
“And, I was seeing so many of my friends reposting it. It let people know what’s going on [you] can trust, and it’s really powerful,” she said. “There’s a community of support here that’s strong.”
Activism is transformative
Espinoza says her newfound activism has been transformative. From being the girl “who used to be afraid to even just go up to a grocery store worker and ask, ‘Where’s the milk?’” the teen now speaks to more than 400 people at rallies.
“I was always frustrated with the world and how my parents, my cousins, my family and me, [were treated] based on different racial biases,” she said. “And it really taught me not to wait for someone to speak up for me, and rather to be that voice, to be the one to speak out when someone else is willing to [give me] a chair at the table.”

“You understand both worlds, but you [also] have the privilege of going out and advocating and not being afraid of what is going to happen to you,” she said.
“Mitu is right,” adds Kouadio. “There’s strength in numbers. There’s strength in community. There’s strength I know that people have your back. People are willing to tell your story, even if you can’t, and we are.”
CASA organizer Vazquez says he is awed by the courage that these young people have to step up in such a hostile environment when their families and their communities are being torn apart, with youth left to pick up the pieces.
“During this critical time, it is important for organizations like CASA to give youth the space to advocate for their families and community and ultimately themselves,” he said. “Those actions will determine their future.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Dr. Meena Seshamani officially took over as Maryland’s new secretary of health Wednesday, taking the helm of a department that has been mired in controversy in recent years.
Advocates say they are antsy to begin working with the secretary on some of those challenges, and to improve relationships between the department and the people it affects.
“We’re looking to meet with the new secretary soon and hope to right that ship,” Ande Kolp, executive director with the Arc Maryland, said Tuesday. Kolp  has been a frequent critic of issues this spring at the Developmental Disabilities Administration, which is overseen by the health department.
Seshamani takes over following the February departure of former Secretary Laura Herrera Scott, who left the position amid a  flurry of negative press for the department.
Changes coming to Health Department

At the news of Herrera Scott’s departure, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the department needed “significant financial cleanup” following reports of incorrect spending projections for Medicaid and for the Developmental Disabilities Administration.
The health department was at the center of a budget storm in the just-ended legislative session, when lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) debated cutting hundreds of millions from the DDA to help close a projected $3 billion gap in the fiscal 2026 state budget.
Moore initially proposed cutting a total of $457 million cut from the DDA, arguing that the agency was experiencing “unsustainable” spending and growth in its programs. Those cuts faced stiff opposition from the public, and lawmakers were able to settle on a still painful, but much more manageable, DDA cut of about $164 million in the final version of the fiscal 2026  budget approved Monday.
The budget woes added on to an already strained relationship between the department and the developmental disabilities community, with the department facing criticisms over transparency, along with complaints of burdensome paperwork for services.
Seshamani also inherits issues at the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Centud6yikiku in Howard County, a high-security hospital that has been riddled with complaints of patient abuse and violence.
In addition to the long-standing state-level challenges, Seshamani will lead the department into uncharted waters in federal relations, given the iiualso the lead the state health department while operating under the Trump Administration’s health care policies.
Seshamani previously served as deputy administrator at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Biden administration. She is a Hopkins-trained surgeon who was a head and neck surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and she has a Ph.D. in economics from Oxford, according to a statement from Moore’s ]office announcing her appointment as secretary. She is a former executive with MedStar.
 
Despite the challenges, Seshamani said she is “honored” to serve as the Maryland Secretary of Health, and thanked Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly for the opportunity in a written statement Wednesday.
“I seek to protect and improve the health of all Marylanders in a thoughtful, data-driven way in partnership with the staff of the Department, across the Moore-Miller Administration, with the Maryland General Assembly, and with all the organizations in the state who strive to provide a world-class health care system for all Marylanders,” she said in the written statement.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC02638-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 08:00:20.687542

Angela Alsobrooks (D-Maryland) came back home to Prince George’s County on Wednesday morning to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for a new Civic Plaza near the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo.
The project, scheduled for completion in December, calls for an enclosed dog park, a playground and an area for community events. It’s one of five planned near the county’s four Metrorail Blue Line stations, and the first ever with the Maryland Stadium Authority, which will invest $400 million. Alsobrooks was part of the negotiations to secure the funding committed in the 2022 General Assembly session.
“I think the lesson for all of us in this is that Prince George’s County is a sure economic driver, not only for Prince George’s County, but that we are so important to the state and to the region. And so goes Prince George’s County, the truth is, so goes the rest of the state,” Alsobrooks to dozens attending.
Alsobrooks joined acting County Executive Tara H. Jackson, several state and county officials and residents.for the ceremony, including at least four councilmembers: Council Chair Edward Burroughs III, Council Vice Chair Krystal Oriadha, At-Large Councilmember Calvin Hawkins and Councilmember Wala Blegay, whose district includes the project site.
After thanking those who pushed to revitalize communities on the Blue Line corridor from Largo to Capitol Heights, Blegay asked Burroughs and Oriadha to join her at the podium. Oriadha took the opportunity to say “the baton” will be passed to new leadership after June’s special election to select a new county executive between Prince George’s State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D) and GOP nominee Jonathan White.
Acting Prince George’s County executive vows ‘to keep the trains running’

The seat came open when Alsobrooks, the former executive, was elected to the Senate last fall and Jackson, the county’s chief administrative officer, stepped in to fill the seat on an interim basis. Oriadha, Blegay and Burroughs supported Braveboy who ran against Hawkins and others in a crowded special primary last month.
“What I hope to see when we pass the baton … is that we can trust the vision to keep on going here in Prince George’s County, and for us to see the growth that we deserve,” Oriadha said, before thanking “every leader for handing the baton to the next one and allowing us to get here today to break ground on what I think will be an amazing start to developing the Blue Line corridor.”
In the meantime, Alsobrooks called it “a tough time” for Maryland with the Trump administration laying off thousands of federal workers who reside in the state and freezing already-approved funding for agencies, many of which are headquartered in the state.
“It has been extremely, very difficult time, but we’re working,” she said in a brief interview after the ceremony. “I’m going to be working with others to ensure that Maryland’s assets are protected and that we continue to grow investment in every corner of our state.”
Racial health disparities remain in Montgomery
Montgomery County had a fetal mortality rate of 5.4% between 2017 to 2021, but that number masks wide racial disparities on maternal health, according to a nearly 200-page report from the county’s Office of Legislative Oversight titled “Racial Disparities in Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes.”
Fetal mortality among Blacks was nearly 8%, compared to 5.2% for Latinx, 4.3% for whites and 3.5% for Asians. Blacks accounted for the highest percentage of preterm births, at 10.1%, compared to 7.5% of whites, 8.4% of Asians and 9.8% of Latinx.
At-Large Councilmember Laurie-Anne Sayles (D), who commissioned the report, will discuss it at a news conference at 12:30 p.m. Thursday at the Montgomery County Council Office Building.
“Montgomery County is one of the healthiest counties in the United States, yet we are still rife with inequities, particularly for our mothers and babies,” Sayles said in a statement. “There is no acceptable reason for racial inequities in health care. Implementing equitable healthcare strategies is crucial to addressing maternal and infant health disparities so that every resident can lead fulfilling, safe, healthy, and happy lives.”
The report comes ahead of Black Maternal Health Week that begins Friday and runs through April 17. It was established and is led by Black Mamas Matter Alliance that’s comprised of organizations and individuals from across the country.

The report also highlights racial disparities in certain areas of the county. While District 5 area has the highest percentage of Blacks in the county, for example, it has the second-fewest maternal health care providers, with 41 out of the 387 total.
In a maternal health care report released last year, Maryland showed slight improvement, and ranked among the top 10 states, but still only got a grade of C.
Two bills that passed the legislature this year aim to improve the situation. Senate Bill 94 and House Bill 553, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Ellis (D-Charles) and Del. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s), respectively, will provide home blood pressure monitors to those in the Maryland Medical Assistance Program.
Eligible recipients are those who are pregnant or postpartum, or have been diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart disease or cardiometabolic disease. The program is slated to begin Jan. 1, “subject to the limitations of the state budget and as permitted by federal law…”

“It is time for me to join my wife spending time with our grandchildren and children,” he said in a statement Monday. “I want to thank everyone for your support over these past fourteen years. I want to assure you that I will be here to help with a smooth transition. It has been my honor to serve the MSAA.”
Kroll has been diplomatic, but not shy when he’s testified before legislative committees on various legal topics. Last year, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, he cited the Apple TV series “The Bear” while testifying against legislation to create a statewide policy to collect data that would assess the policies and procedures of Maryland’s 24 state’s attorney’s offices.
“For those who haven’t seen that, I welcome you to see that,” he said. “That will be a train wreck, a bus wreck and a plane wreck all together. So please remove the public defender to avoid any future confrontation.”

Laura Kelly signed the GOP-led Legislature's budget bill after issuing about three-dozen line-item vetoes and urging lawmaker to revise the plan.,"Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly signed the Republican-led Legislature's large budget bill after issuing dozens of line-item vetoes and recommending lawmaker revisit the blueprint before adjourning the 2025 session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly made an end-of-session plea to the Kansas Legislature after signing a massive state budget bill investing in economic development, water resources and disability services while triggering more than 35 vetoes of provisions labeled as unwarranted earmarks, power grabs or financial gaffes.
Kelly, who has leaned on her veto pen in disputes with House and Senate Republicans since taking office in 2019, said she was concerned the budget endangered the state’s long-term fiscal health and could jeopardize funding for essential programs and services that mattered the most to Kansans. She said it was folly for GOP leadership in the Legislature to adjourn the annual session before release of updated revenue reports evaluating financial implications of the budget.
“This budget will put Kansas in the red by fiscal year 2028,” Kelly said Wednesday in a message to the Legislature. “Given the ongoing economic uncertainty we are experiencing, I urge the Legislature to seriously consider revisiting this budget.”
She said Kansas demonstrated financial resilience during the past seven years after enduring damaging tax and spending decisions under a previous governor. She repeated a warning to not ignore the history of careless decisions leading deep cuts, unnecessary debt and higher taxes.
“We risk losing all of that progress and returning to the dark days of four-day school weeks and crumbling roads and bridges if we don’t correct the structural imbalance we are currently facing,” the governor said.
 
Good news … right thing
Kelly said she was enthusiastic about portions of Senate Bill 125 that provided $6 million to safeguard Kansas’ water supply, a $1.75 million increase in matching funds for local conservation districts and $3 million for a pilot project to manage sedimentation in John Redmond Reservoir.
She thanked the Legislature for $50 million invested in the state’s aviation industry because those commitments would continue “the state’s historic success” in economy development. She praised lawmakers for allocating $1 million to create rural remote workspaces as well as investments to attract innovative businesses in cybersecurity and biotechnology.
The budget appropriately invested in early childhood education while adding $10 million for special education programs in the state’s K-12 public education system, Kelly said. There was $1.25 million to expand rural child care, she said. The governor appreciated $14 million to help 200 people with intellectual or developmental disabilities move off the state’s waiting list for services.
However, the governor said it was troubling the Legislature didn’t address rising health costs by expanding eligibility for Medicaid. Forty states and the District of Columbia have opened that door to billions of dollars in federal funding aimed at lower-income residents without quality, affordable health care.
“Not only will expanding Medicaid make it easier and more affordable for Kansas families to access health care,” she said, “it would also have substantial economic benefits for Kansans.”
She line-item vetoed a provision requiring the state to unenroll and reenroll people in the Medicaid program at an annual cost of $3.5 million to $4.3 million. She said federal regulations forbid caregivers and parents from being denied Medicaid health care coverage without an individual review. In addition, the governor said, the concept was a “highly inefficient, administratively burdensome, costly process.”
 
Education, ‘falls short’
Kelly, known as a public education advocate as governor and during her 14-year tour in the Kansas Senate, said she was disappointed with a collection of budget decisions regarding K-12 schools. She was critical of the elimination of funding for teacher professional development programs and literacy training for teachers.
She objected to the “extremely troubling” decision by the Legislature to finance grants for emergency medical equipment in private schools with money that should be applied to public schools. She suggested the maneuver raised questions about whether lawmakers were challenging Kansas Supreme Court rulings in the Gannon v. State school finance lawsuit that concluded the Legislature violated the Kansas Constitution by inadequately funding schools.
“While I have corrected this via a line-item veto, I remain extremely concerned about the future of education funding in Kansas,” Kelly said. “The Legislature must stop playing games with school finance, especially when it underfunds our public schools and could land the state back in court, relitigating issues we’ve worked to solve in a bipartisan manner.”
The governor also vetoed a budget item that directed school districts to adopt an online curriculum not vetted by the Kansas Board of Education. Constitutional authority for curriculum decisions rested with the elected 10-member state Board of Education, she said.
 
Power grabs
Kelly used a veto pen to dispatch the appropriation of $3 million to the state treasurer, rather than to an executive branch agency, for operation of the “pregnancy compassion awareness” program. Her veto message recalled the August 2022 statewide vote that defeated a proposed amendment to the Constitution reversing a state Supreme Court decision that women had a basic constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.
“I continue to believe that housing the pregnancy crisis center program in the office of the state treasurer is inappropriate and simply politically motivated,” the governor said. “Kansas women facing unplanned pregnancies deserve meaningful support from medical professionals who can provide evidence-based guidance, not from largely unregulated pregnancy resource centers.”
In addition, Kelly vetoed creation of an “unvetted program with no guardrails” in the office of state treasurer that would help expand the state’s workforce. She said it was inefficient for the Legislature to defund an existing workforce program, “Love, Kansas,” in the Kansas Department of Commerce.
Kelly vetoed a provision in the budget that would have increased the cost of office space for journalists in the Capitol.
“This item appears to be targeted at the Kansas Capitol press corps to stymie their ability to effectively report on the actions occurring in the people’s house,” the governor said. “Provisions like this set a dangerous precedent and undermine one of the core principles enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.”
 
Special-interest earmarks
Kelly said she couldn’t allow the Legislature to approve a no-bid $1 million earmark for the O’Connell Children’s Shelter in Lawrence. She said the expenditure circumvented established methods of awarding grants that would include rigorous review of qualified applicants.
“We have made great progress towards eliminating no-bid contracts recently,” Kelly said. “We should not take an unnecessary step backwards.”
Kelly vetoed a directive that the state Department of Commerce devote $500,000 to Wichita State University’s aviation research institute to work on unmanned aircraft systems and $500,000 to the Salina campus of Kansas State University for development of a commercial credentialing process for drones.
“The Department of Commerce did not request this item and it did not go through the agency vetting process,” she said. “I cannot ignore the deficiencies in the process that led to this being included in the budget.”
The governor vetoed a $750,000 earmark for a feasibility study on launching a dental school at Wichita State. She urged higher education and dentistry professionals to collaborate on a strategy for starting the school and present it to the 2026 Legislature.
Meanwhile, Kelly vetoed $500,000 to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation for a forensic genetic genealogy DNA analysis system to identify human remains. The KBI didn’t request the funding through the normal appropriations process, the governor said.
Kelly deleted a plan calling on the Kansas Highway Patrol to collaborate with a third-party entity to build an aviation hangar in Wichita that would be leased by the state.
She also vetoed “poorly written” provisos directing the state Department of Health and Environment to spend not less than $250,000 on preventing transmission of tuberculosis and a separate requirement that KDHE spend up to $96,000 to control tuberculosis. A $263,000 earmark for cerebral palsy research, not requested by KDHE, was vetoed because “intent behind this budget proviso is unclear,” the governor said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P5140370-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-10 00:00:48.543933

(Photo by Thomas Quinn/, University of Washington)State prosecutors have accused Kodiak fisher Duncan Fields and other members of his family of defrauding the state and fish buyers through a coordinated scheme that involved committing perjury and manipulating permits.
Court documents filed Monday state that Fields and his family, who operate Fields and Sons Inc., illegally earned more than $1 million by temporarily transferring various salmon setnet permits to crew members, allowing the family to bypass state limits on individual ownership.
Fields, whose family has been setnetting in Kodiak since 1961, denied the state’s claims, saying by text that the “charges stem from the gifting of limited entry permits to family and crew, something my family and I have done for more than 30 years. This is a common practice in the industry, and we believe that our family has been singled out to try to set an example with a unique application of existing statutes. The charges are not supported by the facts.”
The criminal accusations against the Fields family — which include multiple felonies — surprised fishers and have implications beyond Kodiak. 
To avoid the appearance of impropriety, Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, has paused work on House Bill 117, which would allow setnet fishers to pool their fish as a cooperative before sending them to a fishing tender for processing.
Stutes, co-chair of the House Fisheries Committee, introduced the bill.
Current regulations require each permit holder to submit their fish to a tender separately, but setnet fishers, including Fields, have testified that is impractical and has never been followed in practice.
The investigation against Fields, which revealed fish pooling, prompted Alaska wildlife troopers to intensify enforcement of the regulation across the state, causing setnetters to ask for legislative action.
“It wasn’t Duncan that brought this issue to us, but he’s right in the middle of it, and so I just feel like it’s better to stand down on that bill for now,” Stutes said, calling the bill unrelated to the accusations against Fields.
According to court documents and legislative testimony, the charges against the Fields family stem from a 2023 message given to the Alaska Wildlife Troopers by the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.
“In 2023, the AWT received information about a set gillnet operation reportedly transferring ownership of permits at high frequency and delivering/selling fish under the names of one or two primary permit holders on behalf of other permit holders,” wrote Col. Bryan Barlow, director of the Alaska Wildlife Troopers, in legislative testimony. 
Alaska’s “limited entry” permit system was intended to reduce overharvesting while preserving local harvests.
In Kodiak, a permit holder “may operate no more than two set gillnets, with no more than 150 fathoms of set gillnets,” according to state regulation. 
Prosecutors say that to get around the restriction, members of the Fields family would gift setnet permits to crew members each fishing season, and then the crew members would gift them back to the Fields family at the end of the fishing season, retaining custody.

	The state argues in its initial filing that the gifts violated a state law that says a permit “may not be pledged, mortgaged, leased, or encumbered in any way, transferred with any retained right of repossession or foreclosure, or on any condition of requiring a subsequent transfer.”
“As part of their investigation, wildlife investigators interviewed approximately twenty-one individual crewmembers who had permits transferred to them between 2020 and 2023,” court documents state. “Additionally, they reviewed numerous commercial fishing documents to include permit transfer paperwork, crew member applications, crewmember contracts, gift affidavits, fish ticket data and other relevant paperwork for each individual.”
Stutes, who represents the district that includes the Fields’ setnet sites, gave credit to the CFEC for alerting police.
“You really have to give CFEC some kudos for catching it, saying ‘Whoa, what’s going on here? There’s been too many transfers.’ I’m really impressed with them,” she said. “It tells me the system does work.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly’s flurry of last-minute vetoes Wednesday night aimed to eliminate legislation that would trigger income tax cuts that favor higher-wage earners and corporations, empower the attorney general to block local government from suing big businesses, and force school children to watch video of developing fetuses.
Those vetoes, along with ones involving health care overreach and line items in the state budget, set the scene for the Legislature’s return Thursday. GOP leaders have promised to override a number of the governor’s vetoes, a process that requires the support of two-thirds of both chambers.
The Democratic governor said Senate Bill 269 would “put the state back on the path toward the failed” tax experiment of former Gov. Sam Brownback. The legislation would lower the corporate tax rate and flatten individual income tax brackets over time, based on how much money is in the state’s rainy day fund.
The tax cuts could amount to $1.3 billion annually, Kelly said, while the state is already forecast to have a budget shortfall within three years.
“I have proposed and supported tax cuts when they are implemented responsibly and benefit the people of Kansas, especially those who need it most,” Kelly said. “This bill ignores Kansas families at a time of rising costs and inflation in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars in giveaways to corporations and the wealthy.”
In a joint statement, Senate President Ty Masterson, of Andover, and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, of Wichita, said “Republicans stand with taxpayers” and would work to override the veto.
The governor said she vetoed House Bill 2228 because she is “a strong supporter of local control.”
The legislation would restrict cities and counties from entering into lawsuits with contingency agreements, in which attorneys work for free in exchange for a cut of the settlement if they win. The local government would have to hold a public meeting on the nature of the lawsuit and receive the attorney general’s approval.
The bill was a response to lawsuits like the one Ford County filed late last year that alleges ExxonMobil, Chevron and the American Chemistry Council of “a decades-long campaign of fraud and deception” about recycling plastics. HB 2228 would retroactively apply to July 1, 2024.
During a Senate debate on the bill last month, Sen. Kellie Warren, a Leawood Republican, said the bill’s restrictions on such lawsuits “continues our strong tradition here in Kansas of being pro business and getting things done for our state.”
“More and more frequently, we’ve seen local government joining class action lawsuits for issues such as projects attributed to climate change, data privacy breaches, vehicle theft and other kind of piecemeal litigation that’s really a broad statewide level issue,” Warren said.
Sen. Ethan Corson, a Fairway Democrat, said Attorney General Kris Kobach “just didn’t like the substance” of several lawsuits that had been filed.
“This is really an impediment upon local control, gives the AG an ideological veto and really attempts to solve a problem that doesn’t exist,” Corson said.
Kelly also vetoed House Bill 2382, which merged legislation that would provide for a pay raise for Kansas State Board of Education members with an anti-abortion policy that requires children as young as 5 to watch a high-definition ultrasound of a fetus or a video that shows early human fetal development.
The governor said the bill was “convoluted, manipulative and wrong.”
“This bill fails to establish standards to ensure the information included in the program is evidence-based,” Kelly said. “But it is not surprising, as the goal of this bill is not to educate developing and impressionable young minds — it is to push a specific agenda without proper research to back it up.
“As policy makers and parents, we should demand that our children are provided with high-quality, relevant, researched, and age-appropriate educational experiences free from ideological prejudice.”
The governor also vetoed House Bill 2028, which alters the cost of hunting and fishing licenses and restricts out-of-state residents from hunting migratory waterfowl on public lands, and Senate Bill 18, which authorizes a Hunter Nation distinctive license plate.
Kelly also allowed two bills to become law without her signature:
House Bill 2056, which Kelly said “cleans up some of the ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the crime of impersonating an election official,” but still leaves uncertainty about what actions are prohibited.

Kelly characterized the two health-related bills she vetoed — House Bill 2062 and House Bill 2240 — as “questionable” and an “unconstitutional overreach.” She allowed Senate Bill 250 to become law without her signature. Republicans vowed to try to override the governor’s vetoes.
HB 2062 sought to offer child support payments to a mother from the date of conception. It was initially written and promoted by anti-abortion groups while Democrats criticized the bill for cementing the concept of “fetal personhood” in Kansas law. 
“At first glance, this bill may appear to be a proposal to support pregnant women and families,” Kelly wrote in an announcement. “However, this bill is yet another attempt by special interest groups and extremist lawmakers to ignore the will of Kansans and insert themselves into the lives of those making private medical decisions.”
In a joint statement, GOP leaders said the bill was a “common sense” measure.
“But because of the governor’s unreasonable pro-abortion ideology, even more funding to help pregnant women, fetal development education, and holding deadbeat dads accountable are too extreme for her,” said House Speaker Dan Hawkins, of Wichita, and Senate President Ty Masterson, of Andover.
The governor said the Legislature “has become all too comfortable” in that place. The bill is a “dismissal,” she said, of the will of the voters, referring to nearly 60% of voters rejecting a 2022 constitutional amendment meant to eradicate abortion rights.
“Furthermore, the provisions of this bill are questionable, and it is surprising it has been put forward,” Kelly said.
A Democrat from Topeka, Sen. Patrick Schmidt, amended the bill as it was debated on the Senate floor to include a child tax exemption for fetuses. 
House Democratic Leader Brandon Woodard, of Lenexa, supported the governor’s veto. He said in a statement Wednesday that fetal personhood is “a common and well-known tactic that is used across the country by the anti-abortion movement.” 
He added: “Our family court systems are already able to provide backdated child support that includes pregnancy-related expenses.”
Senate Substitute for HB 2240 was a proposal from the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency that would require legislative approval for any change to public assistance programs in Kansas. That includes programs like Medicaid, or KanCare as it’s known in Kansas, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and intellectual and developmental disability services.
Any requests to federal agencies for waivers for existing rules and changes to funding or modifications of services for disability assistance would not be allowed without approval from the Legislature or, when the Legislature is not in session, the Legislative Coordinating Council, which is made up of the governor, legislative leadership and other state officials.
Kelly called the bill “an unconstitutional overreach by the Legislature into the executive branch” to create undue influence over KanCare.
Republican leadership said the bill is within the scope of the legislative branch’s powers to appropriate state funds.
“Any effort to expand or alter public programs that drastically affect the state’s financial bottom line should be done with legislative approval — not executive fiat,” said Hawkins and Masterson. “It’s disappointing that the governor decided to put her own power above working together.”
They called the veto a “power grab” from the executive branch.
The governor’s office estimates the bill would add hundreds of hours of work and research and jeopardize “the very functioning of the underlying programs.”
“Our doctrine of independent governmental branches is firmly entrenched in the United States and Kansas constitutional law and significant intrusion by one branch into the duties of another has been held to be unlawful,” she said. “There is little question in my mind that this represents such an intrusion.”
Kelly added: “This bill and the subsequent backlog that it would create threatens food and medical assistance benefits for our most vulnerable Kansans at a time of increased inflation and overall financial uncertainty.”
The governor allowed SB 250, known as the Right to Try for Individualized Investigative Treatments Act, to become law without her signature. The bill will allow people with rare, life-threatening or debilitating conditions to access investigational treatments, also known as experimental drugs. Sen. Beverly Gossage, a Eudora Republican, was a major proponent of the bill and defended it on the Senate floor, citing American patients who had to travel outside of the country to receive needed treatments.
Kelly was supportive of the bill.
“Now,” she said. “I think it’s time for the Legislature to finally legalize medical Marijuana, giving the Kansans suffering from chronic pain or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and children suffering with Dravet’s Syndrome (epilepsy) the choice of the treatment they and their doctors determine best suits their needs.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/P4250068-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 22:59:18.217328

(Photo provided by Sarah Dahlstrom-Lehnert)As a daughter and niece of sawmill owners raised in Southeast Alaska, I disagree with Hunter McIntoch’s March 20 article, “The Tongass National Forest is a national treasure worth more than timber.”   
Trees from the Tongass provide the music of the world. Viking Lumber in Klawock, Alaska, is the sole supplier of soundboards for the world’s finest pianos: Steinway & Sons. Steinway pianos are played on stages all over the world by performers such as Lady Gaga and Billy Joel. Steinway is the preferred piano of concert pianists, with 98% choosing a Steinway. 
According to Ben Steiner, CEO and president of Steinway & Sons, the company uses methods that have been handed down from generation to generation since 1853, Steinway builds their pianos one at a time. To achieve such a high level of musicality, Steinway requires a soundboard made of the very best Sitka spruce, lumber supplied exclusively by Viking Lumber, the only US sawmill capable of supplying this lumber. 
In addition to Steinway, Viking also supplies the lumber for the soundboards for Boston and Kawai pianos, Martin and Gibson guitars, wind tunnels for NASA, blades for firefighting helicopters, U.S. national security, interior and exterior doors, garage doors, fences, window trim, staircases, decking, siding and gazebos. Wood chips and sawdust, the byproducts, are used to heat local schools, the public swimming pool and homes throughout Southeast Alaska.  
The multigenerational, family-owned small business has been operating for over 30 years in Klawock and is the last remaining mid-sized sawmill in Southeast Alaska. Viking Lumber employs 46 year-round Alaskans living in rural communities. Their employees receive family wages, health care, dental, vision, life insurance and a retirement plan. Viking’s operations also support 90 employees of contractors in Alaska.   
Indirectly, the sawmill supports the 200 union workers at Steinway’s Astoria, New York, factory, the 19 Steinway & Sons stores, and a network of over 60 dealer storefront locations with hundreds of employees across the United States. This is the impact that Viking makes on just one of the companies they supply. Viking has a nation of customers and their employees that depend on a continuous supply of lumber. 
It’s nearly impossible to find a state that doesn’t have a product that originated from Viking Lumber and the Tongass National Forest. Whether it’s your front door, the gazebo your family gathers under on Sunday afternoon or the instrument your child learns to play, Viking provides the lumber that brings people together. These long-life treasures are made possible by the Tongass National Forest.  
The Tongass National Forest is the largest national forest in the country and Viking harvests only 0.0016% of the forest annually. However, the U.S. Forest Service has offered less than a quarter of Viking’s historic needs over the past four years. The sawmill has survived on the Alaska Mental Health Trust lands timber sale since 2016, which will be completed this year.  
Who is really at risk? An out-of-state seasonal company or the year-round Southeast Alaskan families working in the timber industry.

(Screenshot from livestream)Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee was sworn in as the United States’ new ambassador during a ceremony at the state Capitol Wednesday afternoon. The U.S. Senate confirmed his nomination to the post by a vote of 53-46 earlier in the day.
Huckabee told guests and family members, including his daughter, current Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, that he couldn’t think of a better place for the ceremony than the Arkansas Capitol.
Judge Lavenksi Smith, a fellow Hope native who serves on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, swore in Huckabee, who took his oath with his hand placed on a Bible that he acquired during his first visit to Israel and gifted to his wife, Janet. 
“It’s pretty special, the fact that it has survived these now 52 years is amazing in itself, and I want to say how grateful I am to be able to share this moment with Janet who’s carried not only a Bible all these years, but carried a faithful, consistent willingness to go anywhere and do anything that God ever called us to do,” Huckabee said. “And of all the tests we’ve been given, this may be one of the biggest.”
Former Arkansas governor promises to support Trump’s plans if confirmed Israel ambassador

President Donald Trump nominated Huckabee for the role in November. The native Arkansan has no foreign policy experience, but has visited Israel several times. 
An evangelical Christian, Huckabee is a long-time supporter of Israel and has opposed a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. During a Senate committee hearing last month, Huckabee told members he wasn’t there to defend his personal views and repeatedly said that if confirmed, he would enforce Trump’s policies.
U.S. Sen. John Boozman on Wednesday praised the confirmation of his “dear friend and gifted leader” who will be an ambassador to “a critical ally and partner” of the U.S.
“He has been a lifelong advocate and supporter of Israel who is uniquely suited for this role,” Boozman said in a statement. “As our ambassador, he will work alongside President Trump and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel to advance our shared values and security interests. I congratulate Gov. Huckabee and his entire family, and wish them well as he begins this new chapter of service to our country.”
Huckabee said he expects to deploy to his post in Israel next week.

(Photo Courtesy of governor's office)Two Islamic celebrations will be added to Washington’s list of unpaid state holidays, under a bill signed into law on Tuesday. 
Senate Bill 5106 would make Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha state-recognized holidays. The bill passed the House on March 31, the day after Ramadan concluded. Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it Tuesday night at the Islamic Center of Tacoma, where community members filled the room. 
“Being in that room yesterday and just understanding the impact and the way people felt afterwards, it’s one thing to pass a bill and it’s another thing to be in the community,” said Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma, the bill’s prime sponsor. 
These holidays are celebrated by more than 100,000 Muslims across Washington state. In his remarks, Ferguson noted that Washington is the first state in the country to designate Eid as a state-recognized holiday.
“This is the first in the country, which is a huge deal,” said Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, sponsor of the House version of the bill.
Salahuddin described people having to choose between observing their faith and meeting their academic or professional responsibilities. 
“Too many Muslim students have had to miss milestone events like graduation or face academic penalties simply for observing their faith,” Salahuddin said.
This bill, along with other state laws, would allow employees to take off two unpaid holidays per year for a reason of faith and require postsecondary institutions to accommodate student absences and reschedule exams or school activities “for reasons of faith or conscience.” 
Both holidays are celebrated similarly, with families and community members gathering to eat traditional foods. Islam uses the lunar calendar, which is based on the cycles of the moon, to determine the dates of their holidays, meaning the dates change by around 10 days every year. 
The month of Ramadan marks one of the most sacred times for Muslims. During this occasion, Muslims fast between dawn and sunset and devote their time to spiritual reflection and prayer. Eid al-Fitr celebrates the end of Ramadan. 
Eid Al-Adha observes the completion of the pilgrimage to Mecca and commemorates the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son at the request of God. 
The bill received strong support in the Legislature, with nearly 40 cosponsors combined in both chambers and large numbers of people testifying in support. 
In recent years, the Legislature has taken initiative to expand the list of recognized holidays that celebrate cultural and religious practices. Last year, Lunar New Year was recognized as an unpaid holiday. 
Other unpaid holidays in Washington include Korean-American Day, Cesar Chavez Day, Blood Donor Day, and Water Safety Day. 
“This is something that our community has long been asking for,” Salahuddin said, adding that community members can finally see themselves be represented in state law.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P1187099-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-04-09 21:00:44.108525

Senate President Ben Albritton and Republicans will offer a proposal to permanently exempt sales taxes on all clothing worth $75 or less. It’s a significant tax break, but it will come with a much smaller price-tag than the House plan to permanently cut sales taxes by .75%. 
The Senate plan is expected to lower tax collections by roughly $750 million, while the House proposal is estimated to save taxpayers more than $5 billion.
Albritton said part of the inspiration came from looking at Florida’s tax handbook and realizing that certain items, such as food, were already exempt from taxes. He said he looked at cutting taxes on something that could help regular Floridians.
“We view this as an opportunity to help across the board,” Albritton said of exempting sales taxes on certain clothing items. 
“These are necessities too, now, right? … We’re not talking about you know, folks that are tourists that may come in and go buy you know a $300 dollar jacket or things like that. We have aligned this, we believe at the $75 to where it can help the most number of Floridians.”
The Senate plans to formally vote on its sales tax cut proposal next week. The House on Wednesday voted unanimously for its sales tax cut bill (HB 7031). Several Democrats during debate said that they supported the proposal because they viewed it as something that would lower a “regressive” tax.

The debate over the size and scope tax cuts will need to be resolved as part of the overall budget negotiations.
The House and Senate each passed out proposed budgets for the coming 2025-26 fiscal year on Wednesday. The Senate passed its budget unanimously, while the House vote was 98-6. But because of the divide over taxes, the two bills have a $4.4 billion gap between them. Gov. Ron DeSantis, meanwhile, wants a big cut to property taxes.










We believe in our budget.


– House Speaker Daniel Perez


The House cuts many more vacant positions versus the Senate budget and the Senate includes a pay raise for state workers. The House also calls for putting in place a strict formulary for state workers’ health insurance. 
The House, saying that it needs to pare back the amount of spending overall in state government, has proposed revamping and clawing back the amount of money spent on several high-profile programs passed in the past few years, including a measure designed to ramp up affordable housing options. Several Democrats decried the decrease in funding for affordable housing and said it remains a problem in Florida.
House Speaker Daniel Perez, while talking to reporters on Wednesday evening, did not respond directly to the Senate’s tax cut alternative, but did say that the House proposal was the “largest of its kind” in the country.
“We believe in our budget,” said Perez, but still tried to tamp down any discussion that the House and Senate would not reach a resolution on spending and taxes. The Legislature must have all of its budget work done by April 29 in order to adjourn on time on May 2.
“Somehow it always ends up getting figured out,” Perez said.

And over in the House, voting on a separate bill banning DEI within state and local government was delayed for the second time this week.
The Republican-led Senate Bill 558 defines a range of “divisive concepts” and “discriminatory practices” that campuses are banned from endorsing or affirming. That includes treating a person differently “solely to advantage or disadvantage that individual.”
The UNC System last year repealed their DEI policy, replacing it with a statement of “principled neutrality.” And the Trump administration issued an executive order earlier this year banning DEI efforts on campuses nationally.
The UNC System board, as well as community colleges’ governing body, would be required to adopt new policies to comply with the bill.
“(DEI programming and practices) distracted our system of public higher education from their key goals and what they should be focused on,” said Sen. Brad Overcash (R-Gaston), one of the bill’s sponsors.
Overcash read a passage from “So You Want To Talk About Race,” the 2018 Ijeoma Oluo book, to demonstrate what he viewed as “divisive concepts” in question.
Democratic opponents said that the bill was vague, could have unintended impacts for programs like scholarships for rural students, and would have a chilling effect.
“We are opening Pandora’s box,” said Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Chatham), who argued that any talk of “divisive concepts” should focus on the history of discrimination and racism against students of color at universities.
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) told reporters Wednesday that if “unintended” programs like rural scholarships ended up being impacted by the bill, he would move to “take action” and fix it.
Across the building Wednesday, House Republicans again punted a vote on a bill to ban DEI efforts across state and local governments. It was originally scheduled for debate Tuesday.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Two bills affecting fluoride in drinking water are scheduled for Arkansas House committee discussion Thursday after passing the Senate on Tuesday.
Senate Bill 2, which would repeal a statewide mandate for public water system fluoridation, passed the Senate on an 18-12 vote with five senators not voting.
Senate Bill 613, which outlines a petition process to put the question of water fluoridation on a local ballot for consideration by voters served by a public water system passed by a wider margin, 27-7, with one senator voting present.
Both bills are on the agenda of Thursday’s House Committee on Public Health, Welfare, and Labor.
Committee rejects proposal to repeal Arkansas’ water fluoridation mandate

Both bills were sponsored by Sen. Clint Penzo, R-Springdale, who has said that fluoride is a “poison.” Fluoride — which helps prevent tooth decay — has been used in drinking water since 1945 to improve dental health.
Penzo described SB 2 as “a good local control bill that allows the local water districts to determine” whether to fluoridate in his remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday evening.
SB 2 was voted down in the Senate Public Health committee in February, but Penzo successfully extracted the bill from committee last week over objections from committee chair Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, who said her committee had done its due diligence when urging her colleagues to reject the extraction motion. 
Green Forest Republican Sen. Bryan King, an opponent of water fluoridation, argued that it was a matter the entire Senate should take up and that four members of an eight-member committee shouldn’t be able to hold up a bill that the whole body wanted to consider. The extraction motion passed 19-12, with two voting present.
Arkansas is one of a minority of states that mandates fluoride in its drinking water, and has done so since 2011. 
Penzo’s effort to remove Arkansas’ mandate comes at a time when fluoridation has been put in the spotlight by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been outspoken in his opposition to community water fluoridation. 
The Associated Press reported Monday that Kennedy planned to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending water systems fluoridate their water, and that the EPA announced the same day that it is reviewing potential health risks from fluoride. 
Utah became the first state to ban adding fluoride in drinking water in late March.

,DC,2025-04-10 00:26:05+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,U.S. House GOP punts vote on Trump-backed budget for now amid battle over spending cuts,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-punts-vote-trump-backed-budget-now-amid-battle-over-spending-cuts,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson postponed a vote on the budget resolution that was supposed to take place Wednesday, as he tried to get the support of far-right members of the party who object because it won’t go far enough to achieve their goals of slashing government spending.Johnson, R-La., said he hoped the House would be able to vote on the tax and spending blueprint Thursday, before leaving town for a two-week recess, though he didn’t rule out setting up a conference process with the Senate, or changing the budget resolution and sending it back across the Capitol.“We are working through some good ideas and solutions to get everybody there,"" Johnson said. ""It may not happen tonight, but probably by tomorrow morning.”Johnson’s comments came after he huddled behind closed doors for about an hour with more than a dozen far-right House Republicans who believe the budget resolution doesn’t require the Senate to cut enough spending.“We want everybody to have a high degree of comfort about what is happening here,” Johnson said. “And we have a small subset of members who weren't totally satisfied with the product as it stands. So we're going to talk about maybe going to conference with the Senate, or adding an amendment. But we're going to make that decision. We are going to continue to move forward. This is all positive.”The House and Senate are far from agreement on how much to reduce federal spending later this year when they write the reconciliation bill.The House instructions call on numerous committees to cut spending by at least $1.5 trillion, with more than half of that deficit savings coming from the committee that oversees Medicaid. Those instructions would likely lead to hundreds of billions in federal funding being pulled from the program, though Republicans insisted during floor debate they were only looking to address waste, fraud and abuse.The Senate has given itself a floor of $4 billion in spending cuts, which could lead to substantial deficit increases. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released analysis last week, showing the reconciliation package could bolster deficits by up to $5.8 trillion during the next decade.Trump lobbying, last-minute dramaHouse debate, which took place before the vote was delayed, followed days of lobbying by House GOP leaders and President Donald Trump, who urged holdouts to adopt the budget resolution during a campaign fundraising dinner Tuesday evening.“I think we are there,” Trump said. “But just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you just got to get there, close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding, just stop grandstanding.”That didn’t sway everyone, however, leading Speaker Johnson to pull about a dozen of the far-right members off the floor Wednesday evening just as the House was supposed to move on to the budget vote.The rest of the chamber’s lawmakers waited on the floor for more than an hour as the group huddled nearby.Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, Tennessee Rep. Tim Burchett and Texas Rep. Chip Roy were among the members to get summoned off the floor by Johnson.Scalise pleads to ‘get America back on track’House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., called on Republicans to adopt the budget resolution earlier in the day during floor debate, saying it “just opens the door to” using the complex budget reconciliation process to enact their agenda.“The process where 11 of our committees here in the House will go to work to start making improvements in so many areas to get America back on track,” Scalise said. “And ultimately, that’s why we all come here. We come here to solve big problems. We deal with small issues too. But every now and then — and it’s not often — you deal with a big issue that can actually improve the lives of families all across this country.”Budget Committee ranking member Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said members of his party wouldn't allow the parts of the 2017 tax law that benefit the middle class to expire at the end of the year, rejecting claims from GOP lawmakers.“If you’re a middle-class American, if you are in the 99%, you will not see your taxes go up next year,” Boyle said. “There is no question about that. What is at issue is the tax cuts for multimillionaires, billionaires and big corporations.”Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lloyd Smucker said he couldn't vote to approve the budget resolution since the Senate’s instructions for spending cuts were “not acceptable.”“To me, it’s important we have the guardrails in the initial resolution,” Smucker said, before encouraging House leaders to amend the budget resolution to increase the amount of spending cuts the Senate must implement.“I can’t vote on this bill as it is, but there's a path forward here and that is very, very important,” Smucker said.Roy of Texas also spoke out against the budget resolution, saying the Senate's instructions didn't go far enough to reduce deficits.""The Senate sent over a joke. And we’re going to capitulate to the Senate, knowing full well that the Senate instructions carry the day,"" Roy said. ""And we’re going to be sitting there in a reconciliation debate, where we’re going to end up on the short end of the stick. But worse, the American people are going to end up on the short end of the stick because it absolutely increases deficits. No one can deny it.""Roy added that members of Congress should ""pass a math test"" because the numbers in the budget resolution didn't add up.Lengthy struggleRepublican leaders have struggled for months to get the vast majority of their members on board with the outline.Even if the House finally approves the resolution, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have months of work ahead of them as committees begin writing and debating their sections of the reconciliation package.The budget resolution tasks 11 House committees and 10 Senate panels with meeting vague budget targets. Committees either have a minimum amount of spending to cut or a maximum amount of deficits they can create.The House and Senate are relatively aligned on some of those targets, though they are far apart on spending cuts and potentially tax policy.In the House, the Agriculture Committee needs to slice at least $230 billion; Education and Workforce must reduce spending by a minimum of $330 billion; Energy and Commerce needs to cut no less than $880 billion; Financial Services must find at least $1 billion in savings; Natural Resources has a minimum of $1 billion; Oversight and Government Reform has a floor of $50 billion; and the Transportation Committee needs to reduce deficits by $10 billion or more.The Energy and Commerce Committee’s instructions have been a central issue for Democrats, and many centrist Republicans, who are concerned that Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people, will be a target for hundreds of billions in cuts.Four Senate committees — Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP — must each find at least $1 billion in spending cuts over the 10-year budget window.House committees that can increase the federal deficit include the Armed Services Committee with a cap of $100 billion in new spending, Homeland Security with a $90 billion ceiling for new funding for programs it oversees, Judiciary with a maximum of $110 billion and Ways and Means, which can increase deficits up to $4.5 trillion for tax cuts.Senate committees also got instructions for increasing the deficit, which will allow them to spend up to the dollar amount outlined in the budget resolution. Those committees include Armed Services at $150 billion; Commerce, Science and Transportation with $20 billion; Environment and Public Works at $1 billion; Finance with $1.5 trillion in new deficits, likely for tax cuts; Homeland Security at $175 billion and Judiciary with $175 billion.House instructions call for the reconciliation package to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion while the Senate’s plans say lawmakers can raise it by up to $5 trillion.Slim majorityAssuming the House adopts the budget resolution, GOP leaders will need to keep nearly all of their members supportive during the next couple months as those numbers turn into tangible policy proposals.House Republican leaders can only lose three members on party-line votes, given their paper-thin 220-lawmaker majority.The same number of GOP senators can vote against the final reconciliation package as long as Vice President J.D. Vance casts the tie-breaking vote.Any more Republicans opposing the package would prevent it from becoming law.",,,,2025-04-09 21:00:44.108525

(Getty Images)As President Donald Trump signed several executive orders this week meant to bolster America’s struggling coal industry, miners in Central Appalachia who are responsible for digging up that coal are being left with fewer resources to protect them thanks to federal policies and cuts.
On Tuesday, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration announced that the implementation of an industry rule to limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — a leading cause of black lung disease — was being delayed until August. The rule, finalized last year, was set to go into effect for coal mines on April 14 and would have cut exposure limits for silica dust in half.
MSHA’s announcement of the rule’s delayed implementation came days after a federal judge, in response to a request from industry groups led by the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Administration, issued a temporary stay against it.
It also comes as the federal government — through the new Department of Government Efficiency — is making cuts to agencies across the region that play instrumental roles in protecting coal miners from disease and accidents.
Under the Trump Administration, DOGE has already targeted about three dozen MSHA offices nationwide for closure. Those offices employ mine inspectors whose jobs are to ensure that coal mine operators are meeting industry standards known to lower the risks of accidents and injuries for coal miners.
Coal miners could pay for savings if inspectors lose offices on DOGE list, advocates warn

According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the offices slated for closure performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Following the cuts, it’s unclear how many of those mine inspections will continue to occur.
And last week, DOGE’s cuts in the name of federal cost savings hit the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, an agency that plays a crucial role in detecting black lung among the nation’s coal miners. There, more than 200 jobs were eliminated at the institute’s Morgantown location.
In MSHA’s public notice posted earlier this week, the agency said that the “unforeseen NIOSH restructuring” was a direct driver of the agency’s decision to delay implementation of the rule.
Until those cuts, Noemi Hall worked as an epidemiologist in NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. In her work, Hall and her colleagues were responsible for screening coal miners for black lung disease, often through a mobile clinic that traveled between coal mines and coal communities for easy access.
Those free screenings, Hall said, were crucial for the early detection of black lung, a critical step that can help prevent the disease from developing into its most severe and debilitating form.
“What really happened is the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program, because of the [reduction in force] at NIOSH, well it’s been completely eliminated,” Hall said. “It can no longer serve the functions it needs to serve. Coal miners are more vulnerable now, that’s the truth of it.”
Workers at the CWHSP didn’t just perform the screenings — the agency was also tasked with evaluating coal miners’ results and, when necessary, providing documentation that allowed coal miners to exercise their rights to be transferred to a different, less dusty part of a coal mine if they showed signs of black lung.
Since the NIOSH cuts, however, coal miners haven’t been able to access their X-rays or results from spirometry tests. And since the CWHSP no longer exists, there’s no one to evaluate those results and alert coal miners of their right to transfer.
“Coal miners have lost an essential right that they fought for,” Hall said. “To exercise that right, they need to have the X-ray reviewed by NIOSH and that function is no longer able to occur.”
 ‘We don’t want to turn back the clock on black lung’

Trump’s four executive orders this week honed in on four policies that he says will boost production of “beautiful, clean coal:” ending a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining activities, removing environmental regulations that Trump said slowed approvals for new mining projects, prioritizing grid security and reliability and blocking states from enforcing their own, stricter regulations on coal mining.
But while the Trump administration is demanding more coal be mined in America with fewer protections for the workers, rates of black lung disease are already on the rise, according to a body of research.
  Coal miners watch as President Donald Trump speaks at the White House shortly before signing executive orders on the coal industry on April 8, 2025. (White House livestream)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
The proposed silica dust rule would be the first of its kind to limit coal miners’ exposure to the dangerous dust. Other industries, through the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, have had the same protections in place for years based on decades of research showing the clear harm of inhaling silica dust.
The rule was celebrated by advocates and workers within the coal industry. Former federal officials said that, once implemented, the rule could potentially save thousands of lives by cutting exposure limits in half for workers on an eight hour shift.
But now, with the rule in question and a dearth of workers who are certified to screen and diagnose black lung in Central Appalachia, advocates worry that black lung is going to continue to harm and kill the region’s miners. There is no cure for black lung, only disease management.
“Silica dust is killing miners and the only way to help curb the devastation of black lung disease is to start enforcing this rule,” said Rebecca Shelton, director of policy at the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center in Whitesburg. “Instead, the Trump administration just gutted NIOSH, an institution that provided services that were essential to the enforcement of this rule. Rather than recognizing its mistake and working to reestablish NIOSH, the administration is doubling down on eliminating protections for miners and delaying this rule.”
Hall said she was incredibly proud of the work she was able to do through NIOSH. But now, she said, it’s hard for her to think about what comes next for the coal miners she’s worked with and those who will eventually enter the industry.
“What we do at NIOSH — all the research, the screenings, everything we do — it’s done for the benefit of the coal miners,” Hall said. “Our goal is to help protect coal miners, to make sure they can work safely and be protected. That’s good for the nation and without [protections] I don’t know where we go; we don’t want to turn back the clock on black lung.”
 ‘I want to get back to work’

For Hall, it’s difficult to watch what the government is doing — or, more so, not doing — for the region’s coal miners. But overall, she said, she knows good people are in the government. She considers herself and all of her colleagues who worked at the CWHSP as part of that government.
Now, she said, she wants to ensure people know what the real impact of these policy decisions will be.
“I know the government is full of people who care very deeply about the American people. That’s what I felt I was doing, and I would love to have the opportunity to continue to do that — to help my neighbors, help coal miners,” Hall said. “I don’t want what’s happening to be accepted. I don’t want it to be what I did at NIOSH or what I used to do there. We need to continue doing this work, and I want to get back to work.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)After stalling last year, a bill allowing parents to claim damages in the wrongful death of a fetus received approval in the House on Wednesday, with Democrats raising opposition over reproductive rights.
Under the bill, HB 1517, parents could claim damages for mental pain and loss of support from the fetus at any stage of development, meaning jurors could determine the salary the fetus could have earned over its life as part of the money parents could be entitled to in wrongful-death suits. It cleared the chamber along party lines.
  Robin Bartleman via Florida House
The proposal clarifies that suits couldn’t be brought against mothers or medical providers abiding by the standard of care, but some Democratic lawmakers raised concerns about abortion and IVF access and pregnant people trying to escape abusive relationships.
Weston Democratic Rep. Robin Bartleman said the bill angered her.
“Everyone can get sued now because of this bill. This is not about justice, it’s about cruelty,” she said, pointing out that the bill doesn’t provide protections for IVF clinics and hospitals.
However, Democrats’ attempts to allow only the pregnant person to bring suits and to shield people helping someone secure an abortion from the wrongful death suits failed.
“This is about establishing that life begins at conception, so let’s clear the air, and let’s just say the thing that’s what it’s about, because if it wasn’t, there wouldn’t have been so much avoiding the questions or the answers to direct questions,” Miami Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt said.
Not about abortion?
St. Augustine Republican Rep. Sam Greco, the House sponsor, said the bill was not about abortion.
“This is about a loss that that is is so hard to understand and so hard to believe that money or anything is never going to make one whole,” Greco said. “But when a terrible tragedy like the loss, the wrongful loss, of an unborn child occurs because of wrongfulness, because of a wrongful act, mothers, parents, should have the ability to seek to be made whole in those circumstances.”
The Senate companion, which Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall is sponsoring, is up for its second of three committee hearings Thursday. But other Republicans’ support for the bill is faltering, with former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo also expressing hesitancy about opening medical providers up to lawsuits over the death of a fetus, even at one month of gestation.
“We’re losing OBGYNs. Who’s gonna wanna come to Florida?” Passidomo said during the April 1 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of SB 1284. Passidomo, who also criticized the proposal last year, is chair of the Rules Committee, which Grall’s proposal must go through before reaching the Senate floor.

Wildlife officer Mark Gritzer told club member Jon Mikesell that he had been watching Mikesell and his guests for several days, using binoculars and wearing camouflage to conceal himself in the club’s 1,100 acre swath of Clearfield County woods.
Gritzer left without giving Mikesell a ticket, but Mikesell was rattled because neither he nor any of the club’s other members had given the officer permission to enter the private club’s posted and gated property. 
Pennsylvania laws, however, permit wildlife officers to search private lands without a warrant under a century-old U.S. Supreme Court decision. An attorney for Pitch Pine and the nearby 4,400-acre Punxsutawny Hunting Club said Wednesday that’s what Gritzer and other wildlife officers had done at least 22 times, including the installation of surveillance cameras.
“The clubs are private places, places where members go to enjoy nature without being watched, to have private conversations, without being listened to, to hunt without worrying that strangers might be hiding in the bushes,” Joshua Windham, of the conservative public interest law firm Institute for Justice, said.
The clubs sued the Pennsylvania Game Commission and Gritzer in Commonwealth Court, asking the court to find three state laws allowing the warrantless searches unconstitutional. The court ruled against them in 2023 and they appealed to the state’s highest court. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an argument before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Wednesday, Windham argued the so-called Open Fields Doctrine created in the 1924 high court decision is at odds with the state constitution. He asked the court to reverse its own 2007 decision adopting the doctrine and invalidate the laws the decision upheld.
Courts across the nation have relied on the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision finding that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches of “persons, houses, papers, and effects” does not apply to open land not immediately surrounding a home. According to a study by the Institute for Justice, 90% of land in Pennsylvania is subject to warrantless searches, Windham told the Capital-Star.
Seven states have rejected the Open Fields Doctrine, most recently with the Tennessee Supreme Court finding last summer that warrantless searches by wildlife officials violated that state’s constitution.
Article 1 Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which roughly corresponds to the Fourth Amendment, uses different language, guaranteeing people security in their “persons, houses, papers and possessions.”
“Everywhere you look … you find Pennsylvanians and others using the word possessions to describe private land,” Windham said. “William Penn’s Charter, the original charter that granted him the land that became this commonwealth, granted him the right to quote, ‘possess and enjoy the land.’”
Deputy state Attorney General Anthony Kovalchick argued on behalf of the game commission and Gritzer that reversing its own decision on the Open Fields Doctrine would require the state Supreme Court to jettison a century’s worth of legal precedent.
Justice David Wecht said the court takes the issue of precedent seriously, but challenged Kovalchick to name another area of law where people have no expectation of privacy.

“I mean, our cases make clear that even in a hotel room that you’re renting for a night or a rental car or a visit to another person’s house, you at least get a chance to show an expectation of privacy,” Wecht said.
Kovalchick replied that the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fourth Amendment both provide for a “reasonable expectation of privacy” and reasonable people wouldn’t expect the woods where they hunt to be private.
He added that trespassing laws keeps out members of the public, but the fact that a game warden can enter a property to investigate hunting violations doesn’t mean that the owner has no privacy. 
The justices asked Kovalchick about Gritzer’s placement of cameras on the clubs’ properties. He replied that it was done in response to allegations that members were illegally feeding elk and that no warrant was required to do so.
“Your answer is, ‘Well, the law doesn’t require it,’” Wecht said. “And a response from us might be, Well, why shouldn’t the law require that?’” 
Kovalchick said the court should use the same reading of the constitution as it did inits 2007 decision on this issue, that the term “possessions” does not apply as broadly as the hunting clubs assert.
“If the framers wanted the word possessions to mean every single thing that is owned, including real property, it would have most likely used other phrases like private property,” Kovalchick said.
Justice Kevin Brobson noted other parts of the state constitution refer to the right to possess land. “I’m hard pressed to say that in Article One, Section One, they talked about land as a possession, but in Article One, Section Eight, they didn’t,” Brobson said.
Wecht proposed a hypothetical situation in which a person built a swimming pool in the middle of a heavily wooded property with a wall around it and used it to go skinny dipping. 
“Mr. Greitzer could walk on and put up a camera … the person enjoying that pool cannot even attempt to show any expectation of privacy. How does that square with the Pennsylvania Constitution?” Wecht asked.
“A reasonable person would not believe that going out and doing things that you would only do in the home are reasonable to go out and do in the woods,” Kovalchick replied.

Don Bacon proposes taking back Congress’s tariff power from Trump,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/09/u-s-rep-don-bacon-proposes-taking-back-congresss-tariff-power-from-trump/,"Bacon’s proposal comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's announcement last week of a 10% baseline tariff on international imports, with higher levies on some nations. though the Trump administration decided Wednesday to pause some of those tariffs for 90 days.","U.S. Rep Don Bacon, R-Neb. (Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)LINCOLN — Nebraska Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon unveiled legislation this week to claw back Congress’ authority on tariffs from the White House. 
His bill would require the president — any president — to notify Congress within 48 hours of imposing or increasing tariffs on imported goods, limit the duration of any tariffs to 60 days unless Congress approves extending them, and clarify that Congress can end any tariffs. 
“The Constitution clearly gives the authority for taxes and tariffs to Congress,” Bacon said. “But for too long we have handed that authority to the executive branch.” 
Bacon said in a statement that his proposed federal legislation is “less about the actual tariffs laid by the Trump administration, some of which I support because they are reciprocal, but more a commitment to uphold the Constitution.” Still, the timing of the bill is undeniable, with financial markets roiled and consumers still facing the prospect of higher prices. 
Bacon’s proposal comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s announcement last week of a 10% baseline tariff on international imports, with higher levies on some nations, though the Trump administration decided Wednesday to pause some of those tariffs for 90 days. While the stock market rebounded after a few days of panic, fears of moving on from free trade still loom, as does a potential trade war with China.
It remains unlikely that the GOP-controlled House would give the Bacon bill a floor vote. But it’s an escalation of Bacon’s criticism of the Trump administration, which has put him in the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans willing to do so publicly. 
“Our Founders created checks and balances for a reason,” Bacon said. 
Bacon’s proposal has three House co-sponsors, one Republican and two Democrats. It mirrors a similar bill in the Senate from U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Both are unlikely to be heard by their respective chambers. 
Angie Lauritsen, state director of the progressive political group Nebraska For Us, said in a statement that she was “troubled” that Bacon expressed support for some of Trump’s tariffs, called his bill “a step in the right direction to rein in extreme and dangerous power.” The group regularly attacks Bacon for speaking moderately and voting conservatively. 
“The rest of our House delegation — [U.S.] Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith — must do their part to stand against economically harmful moves made by the Trump [a]dministration in the last week,” Lauritsen said. 
The four other members of the Nebraska federal delegation have expressed more support for Trump’s tariffs.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., expressed support for Trump tariffs in a Fox Business interview this week, saying she wanted “to give the president time.” 
Smith’s office spokesperson said, “The congressman is working to fulfill Congress’s role in trade policy, support President Trump’s efforts to level the playing field for U.S industry and advance rules-based trade.”
Flood’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Bacon bill. 
In a separate interview on Fox Business, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb, said the free trade system had worked “wonderfully well,” but that it was time to move on.
“The problem is the Soviet Union fell 34 years ago,” Ricketts said. “This should have been done 34 years ago to level the playing field.” 
A new era
After World War II, countries shifted their economies to compete globally, built on the premise that free trade benefits all. 
Some economists and political scientists have argued that the flaws of free trade contributed to the rise of Trump and his political movement. He capitalized on working-class anxieties over some jobs being sent overseas and people feeling left behind. Trump has named-dropped former President William McKinley and his late-19th century tariffs, praising them because they had “made our country very rich.” 
The McKinley tariffs of the 1890s aimed to protect American industries and workers by raising import taxes to nearly 50%. The McKinley administration tariffs caused other countries to retaliate, resulting in price increases and a recession. Republicans also lost in the midterms, as voters blamed Republicans for the economic woes at the time. 
The president, who ran on bringing prices down, has acknowledged that his trade war could cause economic hardship for Americans. Nebraska businesses are bracing for the impact of the worldwide tariffs. The Nebraska Farm Bureau has expressed concerns about the now-paused tariffs’ impact on farmers.  
“President Trump and USDA Secretary Rollins have repeatedly promised to level the playing field and expand markets for farmers and ranchers when it comes to international trade,” Pillen said in a statement. “However, we fear yesterday’s announced plan to increase tariffs threatens the economic future of farm and ranch families who have lost money on most major crops for the past three years.”
Gov. Jim Pillen, the first farmer to hold the Governor’s Mansion in decades, went out of his way to show support for Trump’s tariffs, saying the president “is taking bold action to combat decades of cheating and unfair trade practices.”  
“As a pork producer, I totally understand the short-term economic challenges we’re all feeling,” Pillen’s statement reads. “But we’re working hard through this period, and I will do my best to ensure that Nebraska’s interests are heard during this time.” 
Bacon’s tense relationship with Trump 
Bacon is coming off of another close win against former Democratic State Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha. The Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District is considered highly competitive, and Bacon must balance representing one of the most politically divided areas in Nebraska. Democrats in the state have criticized him for years for doing little with his votes to demonstrate his independence. 
This year, Bacon — a retired Air Force brigadier general — stepped back into the national spotlight as a House Republican criticizing the Trump administration over billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Trump’s handling of Ukraine and how the administration treats American allies, including Europe and Canada. 
The bill could revive tensions between Trump and Bacon, as the criticism goes beyond words. Trump and his campaign team actively tried to recruit a Republican challenger to Bacon in 2022. The then-former president came to Nebraska for an unrelated campaign rally and attacked Bacon. 
In 2024, some local GOP activists mounted a challenge to Bacon from the right. Bacon resoundingly beat Dan Frei to face Vargas. Trump endorsed Bacon, and Bacon endorsed Trump for a third time.

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Lawmakers in the North Carolina legislature advanced a pair of bills Wednesday that aim to wipe diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from government and college campuses.
House Bill 171 bans local and state governments from maintaining DEI offices and programs, considering the measures while awarding contracts, and conducting DEI trainings.
And Senate Bill 558 defines a range of “discriminatory practices” and “divisive concepts” on college campuses, expanding on a DEI ban already put in place by the UNC System’s Board of Governors.
Both bills passed out of their respective chambers Wednesday on party-line votes. They’ll head across the building for further consideration.
The pair of bills come amid a push from both the Trump administration and Republican state legislatures to eliminate diversity and equity practices from all corners of the public sector.
A third North Carolina proposal moving through the legislature also bans DEI in K-12 schools. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has said the trio of proposals could eventually be bundled into one larger bill down the line, if GOP leadership opts to do so.
Ban on state and local governments
A state worker who violates the proposal to ban DEI in state agencies could face a civil lawsuit, penalties of up to thousands of dollars and termination. Local government employees, too, would be subject to legal action, penalties and firing.
The bill was changed during committee negotiations, removing language that would have also applied the ban on DEI to “non-state entities” that receive public funds.
Its Republican sponsors also removed criminal penalties from the bill, and excluded charter and private schools from being impacted.
Democratic opponents have argued that there is almost nothing in current state government that would qualify as “DEI,” but that the bill could nonetheless hurt recruiting and retaining workers in a state that has struggled to fill vacancies.
It would take effect on Dec. 1.
Ban on college campuses
Last year, the UNC System Board of Governors voted to repeal its DEI policy, replacing it with a statement of “principled neutrality.” Under the bill approved by the Senate on Wednesday, the board — as well as the governing body for state community colleges — would have to approve another new policy to comply.
The bill is almost identical to a similar bill applying to K-12 schools. It outlines a list of “divisive concepts” and “discriminatory practices” that campuses are banned from endorsing or affirming. That includes treating a person differently “solely to advantage or disadvantage that individual.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 20:07:03.728075

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to pick St. Johns County as the site of the state’s Black history museum.
St. Augustine Republican Sen. Tom Leek sponsored the bill, SB 466, which would establish a board of directors to oversee construction and operation of the museum.
The governor, Senate president, and House speaker would each appoint three board members. The legislative leaders would also appoint two lawmakers from each chamber.
Although the upper chamber’s vote brings the museum closer to the finish line, the House version of the bill hasn’t been heard as the time to move forward policy in this year’s session dwindles. However, the Senate and House budgets both include a $1 million appropriation for the museum.
“Understanding Black history is crucial because it’s an integral part of American history, a beautiful part of Florida history,” said St. Petersburg Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, a co-sponsor of the bill. “It illuminates the struggles and triumphs of a people who have significantly contributed to the shaping of not only the nation, but of the state. Importantly, it’s contributed to the very uniqueness of the state of Florida.”
The vote comes two years after the Legislature created a task force to recommend a location for the museum, a design, a business plan, and its educational content. However, the museum’s potential site became the task force’s focus over its 10 meetings as St. Johns County and Eatonville in Orange County emerged as the leading locations.
The late Orlando Democratic Sen. Geraldine Thompson, who chaired the task force, wanted the museum in Eatinville, one of the first self-governing Black municipalities in the country.
Florida Memorial University agreed to lease 17 acres of land for the museum, about a 10-minute drive outside of St. Augustine.
St. Johns County was the site of Florida’s first Black settlement (Fort Mose) in 1738, when the Spanish still colonized the region.

All present Democrats voted against it and 12 Republicans joined them despite arguments from Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, that the bill made practical and political sense.
The bill came out of the Senate Special Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform, part of swath of priority legislation this year for Republicans.
With support from sponsor Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to amend Senate Bill 49 to postpone the date it would take effect.
Rep. Tom France, D-Missoula, suggested the amendment would address concerns the legislation intends to protect Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who is facing disciplinary charges. An original draft of the bill only applied to the attorney general.
On the House floor Monday, Millett pointed to a couple examples where he believed the bill would be helpful, including the case against Knudsen.
“This is a freedom of speech issue and will allow our constitutional officers and members of the legislature who just happen to be lawyers from being persecuted for their speech by the lawyer disciplinary system,” Millett said.
Currently, the attorney general is “hobbled” from defending the legislature, as evidenced by the disciplinary case underway, Millett said.
However, Millett also said Gov. Greg Gianforte “railed against the Supreme Court” in his state of the state address.
The governor did so without fear he would be “dragged in front of the ODC,” the Office for Disciplinary Counsel — but Millett said that wouldn’t be true if Gianforte also was a lawyer.
The Office for Disciplinary Counsel handles discipline against members of the bar.
“If this isn’t a chilling effect on speech, I don’t know what is,” Millett said.
Lawyers are sworn to abide by rules of professional conduct, which include respect for the legal system.
In his vehement defense of the legislature during a previous dispute, Knudsen at one point said he did not recognize the court’s order as binding and would not follow it.
The Office for Disciplinary Counsel filed a complaint alleging violations, and the Commission on Practice  recommended the Montana Supreme Court temporarily suspend Knudsen.
The case is pending.
In response to ethics charges by the ODC, Knudsen has said he could have phrased things differently. He also recently described the disciplinary process as a “kangaroo court” to KGVO.
To protect both speech and the separation of powers, Millett said the bill would create a small carveout for Constitutional officers, also the superintendent of public schools, auditor, lieutenant governor and secretary of state.
If it had passed, the bill would have protected members of the legislature as well.
On the floor during a short debate, Rep. Ed Stafman, D-Bozeman, argued against it. He said he believes immunity from accountability should be granted only “very, very sparingly,” but the bill provides broad immunity.
“The bill would erode accountability, encourage abuse of power, undermine the rule of law, (and) reduce public trust in government,” Stafman said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1488675709-1024x662.jpg,,,2025-04-09 20:07:03.728075

(Getty Images)As President Donald Trump signed several executive orders this week meant to bolster America’s struggling coal industry, miners in Central Appalachia who are responsible for digging up that coal are being left with fewer resources to protect them thanks to federal policies and cuts. 
On Tuesday, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration announced that the implementation of an industry rule to limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — a leading cause of black lung disease — was being delayed until August. The rule, finalized last year, was set to go into effect for coal mines on April 14 and would have cut exposure limits for silica dust in half.
MSHA’s announcement of the rule’s delayed implementation came days after a federal judge, in response to a request from industry groups led by the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Administration, issued a temporary stay against it.
It also comes as the federal government — through the new Department of Government Efficiency — is making cuts to agencies across the region that play instrumental roles in protecting coal miners from disease and accidents.
Under the Trump Administration, DOGE has already targeted about three dozen MSHA offices nationwide for closure. Those offices employ mine inspectors whose jobs are to ensure that coal mine operators are meeting industry standards known to lower the risks of accidents and injuries for coal miners. 
According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the offices slated for closure performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Following the cuts, it’s unclear how many of those mine inspections will continue to occur.
And last week, DOGE’s cuts in the name of federal cost savings hit the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, an agency that plays a crucial role in detecting black lung among the nation’s coal miners. There, more than 200 jobs were eliminated at the institute’s Morgantown location.
In MSHA’s public notice posted earlier this week, the agency said that the “unforeseen NIOSH restructuring” was a direct driver of the agency’s decision to delay implementation of the rule.
Until those cuts, Noemi Hall worked as an epidemiologist in NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. In her work, Hall and her colleagues were responsible for screening coal miners for black lung disease, often through a mobile clinic that traveled between coal mines and coal communities for easy access.
Those free screenings, Hall said, were crucial for the early detection of black lung, a critical step that can help prevent the disease from developing into its most severe and debilitating form.
“What really happened is the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program, because of the [reduction in force] at NIOSH, well it’s been completely eliminated,” Hall said. “It can no longer serve the functions it needs to serve. Coal miners are more vulnerable now, that’s the truth of it.”
Workers at the CWHSP didn’t just perform the screenings — the agency was also tasked with evaluating coal miners’ results and, when necessary, providing documentation that allowed coal miners to exercise their rights to be transferred to a different, less dusty part of a coal mine if they showed signs of black lung.
Since the NIOSH cuts, however, coal miners haven’t been able to access their X-rays or results from spirometry tests. And since the CWHSP no longer exists, there’s no one to evaluate those results and alert coal miners of their right to transfer.
“Coal miners have lost an essential right that they fought for,” Hall said. “To exercise that right, they need to have the X-ray reviewed by NIOSH and that function is no longer able to occur.”
‘We don’t want to turn back the clock on black lung’
Trump’s four executive orders this week honed in on four policies that he says will boost production of “beautiful, clean coal:” ending a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining activities, removing environmental regulations that Trump said slowed approvals for new mining projects, prioritizing grid security and reliability and blocking states from enforcing their own, stricter regulations on coal mining.
But while the Trump administration is demanding more coal be mined in America with fewer protections for the workers, rates of black lung disease are already on the rise, according to a body of research.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
The proposed silica dust rule would be the first of its kind to limit coal miners’ exposure to the dangerous dust. Other industries, through the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, have had the same protections in place for years based on decades of research showing the clear harm of inhaling silica dust. 
The rule was celebrated by advocates and workers within the coal industry. Former federal officials said that, once implemented, the rule could potentially save thousands of lives by cutting exposure limits in half for workers on an eight hour shift.
But now, with the rule in question and a dearth of workers who are certified to screen and diagnose black lung in Central Appalachia, advocates worry that black lung is going to continue to harm and kill the region’s miners. There is no cure for black lung, only disease management.
“Silica dust is killing miners and the only way to help curb the devastation of black lung disease is to start enforcing this rule,” said Rebecca Shelton, Director of Policy at Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center. “Instead, the Trump administration just gutted NIOSH, an institution that provided services that were essential to the enforcement of this rule. Rather than recognizing its mistake and working to reestablish NIOSH, the administration is doubling down on eliminating protections for miners and delaying this rule.”
Hall said she was incredibly proud of the work she was able to do through NIOSH. But now, she said, it’s hard for her to think about what comes next for the coal miners she’s worked with and those who will eventually enter the industry.
“What we do at NIOSH — all the research, the screenings, everything we do — it’s done for the benefit of the coal miners,” Hall said. “Our goal is to help protect coal miners, to make sure they can work safely and be protected. That’s good for the nation and without [protections] I don’t know where we go; we don’t want to turn back the clock on black lung.”
‘I want to get back to work’
After Trump announced his coal industry executive orders on Tuesday, West Virginia’s congressional delegation was quick to celebrate what they saw as wins for the state’s struggling coal economy.
“These executive orders are welcome news for our miners and the entire industry, and I am glad we have a president that recognizes the need to support them,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va. — whose family operates multiple coal mines that have been subject to dozens of fines due to health and safety violations — said he was “proud” to stand with Trump in ensuring that “West Virginia can continue to lead the way in energy production for generations to come.”
And Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said the orders will help create jobs and improve the state’s economy.
“No one works harder than a West Virginia coal miner, and I thank President Trump for his commitment to the coal industry and West Virginia,” Miller said.
Meanwhile, no statements have come from the delegation regarding the delay of the silica rule or the potential vulnerability of West Virginia’s coal miners as they are being asked to mine more coal.
The strongest statement has come from Capito, who told reporters last week that she had “strong disagreements” with DOGE’s cuts in the state, specifically at NIOSH. She said she planned to talk to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the cuts, but no further announcements on the subject have been made.
Last year, when House Republicans attempted to halt the implementation of the silica rule by blocking funding for it, Capito — who sits on the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations — declined to comment on the proposed legislation or the rule.
And none of the state’s congressional delegation has signed on to support the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act, which would increase inspections at mines, enhance enforcement measures and penalties, modernize safety standards and levy more rights for coal miners.
For Hall, it’s difficult to watch what the government is doing — or, moreso, not doing — for the region’s coal miners. But overall, she said, she knows good people are in the government. She considers herself and all of her colleagues who worked at the CWHSP as part of that government.
Now, she said, she wants to ensure people know what the real impact of these policy decisions will be.
“I know the government is full of people who care very deeply about the American people. That’s what I felt I was doing, and I would love to have the opportunity to continue to do that — to help my neighbors, help coal miners,” Hall said. “I don’t want what’s happening to be accepted. I don’t want it to be what I did at NIOSH or what I used to do there. We need to continue doing this work, and I want to get back to work.”

Tyson Running Wolf, D-Browning, who carried the bill in the House. “It’s a day that celebrates the ancestral lineage of all Montanans, again, all Montanans.
“And it’s a day that is shaped and molded by each community and how that community wants to celebrate each other. So this bill gets away from eliminating a holiday and simply gives Montanans the option to celebrate what they prefer on the second Monday in October.”
Attempts to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day in previous sessions were unsuccessful, partially due to some versions of legislation eliminating Columbus Day completely. The current version of the bill passed the Senate in February with just three opponents.
The co-celebration of the two holidays in October is done in Rhode Island, Nebraska and Alabama, while four states and Washington, D.C., have established Indigenous Peoples’ Day as a standalone state holiday.
Running Wolf said in the committee hearing many Montanans came and shared stories about their backgrounds — some Native, some from other parts of the world. One man with Irish heritage came in and spoke the Irish language, sharing its meaning to his own history.
“And it was beautiful. And we celebrated it all together,” Running Wolf said. “… What we heard in the hearing is that people want to learn about each other and the rich heritage that so many Montanans bring to Montana.”
During floor debate, Rep. Ed Byrne, R-Bigfork, introduced an amendment to change the order of holidays in the bill, to make Columbus Day listed first to maintain “its precedence of establishment.”
Running Wolf said his biggest concern was that it would delay the process by sending the bill back to the Senate and cost more taxpayer money. The amendment failed to pass 27-70.
“Indigenous Peoples’ Day is a testament to our shared history values as Montanans, it celebrates the collaborative efforts to the stewards of our land, educates us about the profound knowledge and contributions of all Montana communities, and highlights our shared strength and responsibility,” Running Wolf said. “By honoring this day we take pride in our past, foster a deep understanding of all Indigenous entities and work together protect our cherish holiday heritage for future generations.”
The bill made one additional change to recognized state holidays by updating “Lincoln’s and Washington’s Birthdays” to “Presidents’ Day.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos06-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 20:07:03.728075

(Photo via USCG)The Florida Senate approved an institute at Florida State University to research the insurance market during a time when hurricanes have battered the state and insurance regulators have been questioned under oath by the House. 
Sen. Jay Trumbull, a Panhandle Republican, is the sponsor for SB 114, a bill that would create the Center for Excellence in Insurance and Risk Management at Florida State University. 
“Going back 20-plus years ago, Florida looked at insurance very differently pre-Andrew,” Trumbull said in March during the bill’s first committee stop. “Post-Andrew, we started to take a much different look at how we needed to plan forward and operate.”
Hurricane Andrew inflicted an estimated $26 billion in damage in 1992 when it hit Miami-Dade County. More than 63,500 homes were destroyed and 124,000 were damaged while 65 people were killed, the Tampa Bay Times reported. 
The bill would moves the Hurricane Loss Projection Model from Florida International University to FSU. 
Trumbull said the bill is meant to make the state’s measurement and management of insurance more “robust.” It would help legislators in developing and evaluating “evidence-based policy options and making recommendations related to insurance and risk management,” according to the bill text. 
Florida lawmakers have convened for special sessions regarding insurance, developed stricter building codes, and run election campaigns based on insurance issues.
The center would address all lines of insurance and be responsible for researching inquiries from the House, Senate, or Office of Insurance Regulation.  
Insurance regulators were questioned by the House Insurance & Banking Subcommittee earlier this session following a Tampa Bay Times story detailing how insurance companies claimed financial ruin while sending billions to affiliated companies. 
While FIU would lose the loss model, Trumbull said, it is owned by the Office of Insurance Regulation, not the university. The center would be located in the FSU College of Business and Department of Risk Management. 
FSU has a Risk Management and Insurance Center that studies the market, housing prices, homeowners’ insurance, and catastrophe risk.
The bill passed both its committee assignments in the Senate unanimously. Its companion in the House, HB 1097, has been passed by three committees and now is before the Commerce Committee.
The Senate budget proposes $3 million for the loss model.

Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, speaks on the Senate floor on April 9, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill that sought to reduce penalties for possessing small amounts marijuana in North Dakota failed in the Senate Wednesday on a 33-13 vote.
House Bill 1596 would have reduced the penalty for possessing less than a half ounce of marijuana from a criminal infraction to a noncriminal citation, similar to a speeding ticket, and a $150 fine. 
The bill also spells out other reduced penalties for other low-level marijuana possession offenses, varying based on the amount and the age of the person. Possessing 500 grams of marijuana or more would remain a Class A misdemeanor under the bill.
Court hearings for low-level offenses would not be required, but a person could still choose to appear in court. Bill sponsor Liz Conmy, D-Fargo, previously said the proposal aimed to reduce the amount of time judges and attorneys spend on minor marijuana possession offenses, which often result in a $150 fine but can require three court appearances.
Low-level marijuana offenders could pay a fine, skip court, under North Dakota bill

Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, voted against the bill and said law enforcement agencies were also opposed to the measure. She pointed to the defeat of recreational marijuana ballot measures and said the bill would go against the people’s wishes.
In November, 53% of North Dakota voters opposed a ballot initiative that sought to legalize recreational marijuana for adults and create a framework for a legal cannabis industry. It was the third such effort to fail in six years.
Sen. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, questioned why the bill had no escalating penalties for repeat violations for marijuana possession, like the state has included for other types of crimes.
“I’ve been concerned this session at the number of times we talk about the prison being full, or the courts being clogged, and so the way we’re addressing it is to lessen crime?” Larson said. “I feel that we have criminal offenses on the books for a reason and the people have voted on this and wanted to keep this on the books.”
Sen. Ryan Braunberger, D-Fargo, was among those who voted in favor of the measure.
“Neighboring states are starting to legalize it more and more, so smaller amounts of possession are going to get more prevalent,” Braunberger said. 
State’s attorneys from Cass County and Stark County both submitted testimony in favor of the bill. Both counties border states where recreational marijuana is legal.
Braunberger said he expects the issue to remain contentious going forward.
“I think it’s only a matter of time when the federal (government) is going to decriminalize it all together,” he said. 
The bill passed the House in February on a 76-17 vote.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill raising the public vote threshold to 60% to approve constitutional ballot measures in North Dakota passed the Senate Wednesday on a 33-13 vote.
House Resolution 3003, sponsored by Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, would require a 60% threshold to pass both constitutional ballot petitions initiated by the people and constitutional resolutions from the Legislature.
“It’s quite likely that we all agree that it should be possible to change our state’s foundational document, however it should be more difficult than it currently is,” said Sen. Jeff Barta, R-Grand Forks, who voted in favor of the resolution.
Barta said the North Dakota Constitution has been amended 167 times compared to the U.S. Constitution, which has been amended 27 times with stricter rules that include approval from three-quarters of all 50 states.
Sen. Dick Dever, R-Bismarck, voted in favor of the bill and said North Dakota voters will still have the final say on the new potential threshold at the ballot box. He added he believes there is a segment of the population that has an agenda to sow division against lawmakers in state government to further an agenda of dissatisfaction.
“I think we should preserve the republic rather than attacking it,” Dever said.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R- Hazelton, voted against the resolution and warned lawmakers that not only would it become harder to pass constitutional measures in the future, but it would be harder to change parts of the constitution already in place.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

“We passed a resolution that is intending to change the constitution on term limits, so when you raise the threshold, you are making it harder to change things that were passed that you think weren’t good,” Magrum said.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, voted against the bill and told lawmakers the current ballot petition process serves as an important check on the Legislature.
“Every time the state Legislature has proposed limiting the powers reserved to the people, the voters have wisely rejected that,” Cleary said. 
Twenty-three pieces of testimony were submitted on the resolution with all but three opposed to  raising the threshold. The League of Women Voters of North Dakota was among the opponents, pointing out the defeat last November of Measure 2, which contained several proposed changes to the constitutional ballot measure process.
“For over 100 years, North Dakotans have used direct democracy to shape state policy,” Barbara Headrick, League of Women Voters of North Dakota president, said in a statement Wednesday. “With the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 3003, the North Dakota Legislature is attempting again to weaken the power of the people to amend our state constitution. … They need to stop trying to limit the voice of the people in the governance of our state.”
The resolution passed the House in January on a 65-28 vote.
If approved by the Secretary of State’s Office, the resolution will be put to the voters during the 2026 general election.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Hundreds of Washington state workers descended on the Capitol on Wednesday, staging a sit-in outside the governor’s office and a march to the gates of the executive mansion to protest potential furloughs amid a massive budget shortfall.
Workers from the Washington Federation of State Employees and other local unions pushed for a so-called wealth tax rather than cutting their earnings or state programs to fill the estimated $16 billion budget hole. Gov. Bob Ferguson has shunned the revenue idea as an untested concept that will attract court challenges.
Protesting workers made two passes to Ferguson’s office. The first time they encountered a closed door and chanted from outside for the governor to meet with them. A short time later, they returned and a small crowd, including federation president Mike Yestramski, got inside but did not meet with the governor.
“One of his people came out and said we’ll let him know you were here,” Yestramski said. “I think we made our message clear.”
Ferguson was not on campus Wednesday. He was working in Seattle.

Brionna Aho, Ferguson’s communications director, said in an email, “We value our state employees. Our team has been in regular and close communication with WFSE at multiple levels, including numerous calls and meetings with our senior leadership.”
As part of his suite of proposed budget cuts, Ferguson has floated two years of one-day-per-month furloughs for state workers. Potential budget saving options also include closing state facilities, like reentry centers for people leaving prison and residential care facilities for people with developmental disabilities.
Senate Democrats’ operating budget plan, unveiled last month, includes 13 unpaid furlough days in the fiscal year starting July 1. House Democrats avoid furloughs entirely.
The governor and Democratic lawmakers both look to honor collective bargaining agreements with 5% wage increases over the next two years for state employees. However, state workers say the effect of the furloughs will eat up most of the negotiated pay hikes.
Workers began Wednesday with an hour-long rally on the Capitol grounds, next to Tivoli Fountain, in which labor leaders and legislators repeatedly blasted the first-term governor for not standing behind them after public sector unions provided their full-throated support for him in the 2024 election.
Speakers talked of the chaos that could ensue if thousands of state workers staged a one-day walkout in protest of the furlough ideas.
 “Governor Ferguson, the choice is yours. We gave you your job. We can take it from you too,” said Milö Nicholas, a public health worker and vice president of Local 443 that represents state employees in Lewis, Mason and Thurston counties.
Rep. Brianna Thomas, D-Seattle, said the governor seemed to have forgotten who helped get him elected. She vowed to stand strong against balancing the budgets on the backs of the workers.
“Bob may be a chessmaster, but he sure as s**t ain’t beating me in a street fight,” she said.
Yestramski took the stage last at the outdoor rally. He has called Ferguson a “pseudo Democrat” and a “ratfink.”
“I heard the governor might be a little upset with us. He doesn’t like being called out,” Yestramski said. “You know what we don’t like? Being scammed.”
Yestramski said he had not met with Ferguson since he took office. 
He called on Ferguson to “look us in the eye and tell us why you are prioritizing billionaires over the working people of this state. He’s too busy to meet with us. We’ve all got time right now,” Yestramski told the cheering crowd as it then headed to the Capitol.
Inside the rotunda, their booming chants “No cuts, no furloughs, tax, tax the rich” could be heard in the House and Senate chambers where lawmakers were voting on legislation. 
Democrats from the two chambers are now negotiating a final budget plan. 
Democratic legislative leaders said Wednesday they plan to release new ideas for raising revenue next week in line with the governor’s wishes. 
“My members and I in the House are all going to get pushed to our limit in a year like this. Every member of the Senate is going to get pushed to their limit in a year like this, and so is the governor,” House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, told reporters. “The point that we’re trying to get to is probably a somewhat narrow path.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A state-contracted Medicaid managed care plan paid $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation, a direct-service organization affiliated with First Lady Casey DeSantis, the head of the state’s largest health care agency told legislators Wednesday.
Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) Secretary Shevaun Harris said a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation was part of a larger $67 million agreement the agency signed with Centene Health Plan, one of several managed care plans the state contracts with to provide health services to the poor, elderly, and disabled. The other $57 million went to the agency.
The $10 million payment was not immediately disclosed to the Legislature. Instead, the House discovered its existence from the October minutes from a Hope Florida Foundation meeting. Agency officials discussed the payment under questioning from members of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee.
The scrutiny of Hope Florida comes amid speculation that Casey DeSantis may run for governor. Gov. Ron DeSantis has touted Hope Florida and when asked about the foundation recently, he asserted that a reporter was helping with a “smear” of the program.
Harris was secretary of the Department of Children and Families, not AHCA, when the agreement was reached. 
She told House Health Care Budget Subcommittee Chairman Alex Andrade that Centene approached the state about improper reimbursements. 
According to the Centene website, the company operates in Florida under the brands Sunshine Health, Wellcare, AmBetter Health, and the Children’s Medical Services Health Plan, which serves medically complex children.
She said an agreement had been reached whereby Centene returned the overpayments to the state. Harris said the money went into state trust funds and was properly accounted for.
Andrade then asked Harris how $10 million could “walk from AHCA’s bank account to Hope Florida’s DSO [direct service organization] last October?”
Harris replied: “Those funds were never given to the state. They were a direct contribution made from Centene to the foundation.”
Andrade, an attorney, continued to press, asking Harris whether AHCA required Centene as part of the settlement to make a separate $10 million payment outside the state’s accounting system.
Harris said she’s not an attorney and wasn’t involved in the settlement discussions.
“However, I  know a lot of lawyers were involved in the drafting of the settlement agreement and I have to believe that all T’s were crossed and I’s dotted to ensure the authority was there,” she said.
Centene did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.
‘Stunning to me’
The Florida Phoenix obtained a copy of the agreement, signed by former AHCA Secretary Jason Weida (now Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff), Chief Deputy Attorney General John Guard, Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworksi, Department of Health Chief of Staff Cassandra Pasley, and Centene Corp. Executive Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel Christopher A. Koster.
Andrade told reporters after the meeting that he was disappointed in some of Harris’ responses.
“To act as if this wasn’t state funds was stunning to me,” he said. 
“The entitlement that it takes to act as if that this settlement was not a settlement related to the over-expense of state funds kind of shocks me. I don’t know what we can do but, obviously, at the very least we need more accountability on what that $10 million is being used for and how on earth AHCA felt justified in transferring those funds to a separate different agency.”
The reveal follows news reports about the Hope Florida Foundation, launched by First Lady DeSantis.
It is one of several financial matters involving AHCA that the subcommittee is examining.
The panel last month criticized overspending and financial mismanagement by AHCA, with a document showing the agency could face upward of a $965 million deficit. The Legislature thought it had addressed one of the overpayments when it gave the agency $160 million to settle a dispute with the federal government over supplemental Medicaid payments made to hospitals. The agency, though, ended up spending the money elsewhere, a mistake that the agency said occurred due to accounting errors.
During Wednesday’s meeting, Harris repeatedly stressed the difference between Hope Florida, which according to its website is a government initiative that serves as a connection point for collaboration between the public and private sector, faith-based communities, and nonprofits. Hope “navigators” work at agencies across state government with people seeking assistance in transitioning away from government benefits to economic self-sufficiency.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the not-for-profit direct support organization that assists Hope Florida.
Andrade and other members of the House panel spent the better part of a three-hour meeting pressing Harris, as well as Deputy Secretary for Medicaid Brian Meyer, on the details of the new statewide Medicaid managed care contracts — and about a requirement that contracted plans partner with the Department of Children and Families on its Hope Florida initiative. 
 Last minute invite?

Initially, Andrade pushed Meyer about the $10 million payment to Hope Florida Foundation and who made it. Meyer said he wasn’t prepared to answer the question. He said he was appearing before the committee on “relatively short notice” and, when his staff asked what the meeting was about, was told the requirements of the new Medicaid managed care contracts. Meyer said that was what he was prepared to discuss with the House budget panel.
“I think if there are other topics you want to discuss, maybe there is another time or individual to address those with.” Meyer said.
Andrade shot back: “Mr. Meyer, I believe that is a valid question to be asked here,” he said, continuing, “Are you telling me AHCA does not have the details of its own interactions with this nonprofit that is such a massive priority in the state’s largest contract?”
Mallory McManus, the former registered agent for the Hope Florida Foundation and a spokesperson for AHCA, issued a statement following the meeting criticizing Andrade.
“It’s concerning how little Representative Andrade understands about Medicaid, as demonstrated in his performative committee hearing today. He also purposely misconstrued the the structure and the nature of the Hope Florida program, which is shameful. AHCA is proud of our work serving Floridians particularly in helping people reduce government dependency and achieving economic self sufficiency.”

The City of Omaha is to own, maintain and operate the future Levi Carter Park Activity and Sports Complex along the north shore of Carter Lake in Levi Carter Park. That’s north of downtown, near Eppley Airfield.
A ceremonial groundbreaking Wednesday at the site drew politicians including Gov. Jim Pillen, Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and City Councilwoman Juanita Johnson.
 Leveling the playing field 

Also speaking was former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha, who helped lead legislative efforts in 2022 and 2023 to direct public funding to the historically disinvested area he represented.
Wayne, who was term-limited at the start of this year, expects the new facility to help level the playing field for families in North Omaha who have not had the same access to higher levels of youth sports as other more affluent areas.
“We have redlined youth sports in Omaha,” Wayne said, citing the dearth of athletic complexes in eastern Omaha compared to those that draw crowds and economic development to western Omaha and the suburbs.

Wayne, who coaches and referees youth sports, said sports and other community programming at the city-run park should be more financially accessible to local families.
Building activity at the site is to start next month.
Omaha officials said the community and athletic complex will include the largest basketball facility in Omaha, with 10 indoor basketball courts that can be converted to 14 volleyball courts. Among other features: a wrestling room; fitness area; computer lab; medical exam and tele-health rooms and a community meeting space.
Outside, the complex will offer four artificial turf soccer fields, new picnic shelters, a grand lawn and a designated food truck area.
Johnson recalled her younger years when she said Levi Carter Park on Sundays was a hub for social gatherings.
“We knew there’d be activities, food, laughter — this place would be the avenue we’d be able to do that,” she said. 
While Johnson said that type of community bustle waned in the last decade or so, she is excited that within a year or so it could return. The complex is expected to open in late 2026.
 Big deal, says governor

Stothert said the facility should generate new tourism and economic development for the area.

“This is an investment in youth and families, offering access to services and programs and creating new tourism and development opportunities surrounding Levi Carter Park,” she said.
“This is a big deal,” Pillen told the audience Wednesday. He said the complex can be a place where youths put away cell phones and engage in old-fashioned fun.
“Having played athletics growing up, I can testify firsthand to the valuable life lessons of team sports,” said Pillen, a former Husker football player. “They teach determination, cooperation and self-discipline.”
The governor gave shout outs to the city and Wayne, who with State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North championed the legislative effort to steer pandemic-related funding toward east Omaha.

The $45 million for the complex comes from a $35 million federal capital projects grant related to COVID-19 recovery and a $10 million award from the state’s North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program.
Omaha parks director Matt Kalcevich said the facility creates opportunities for hosting regional basketball, volleyball and soccer tournaments and events.
“Health and wellness play a significant role in providing our outstanding quality of life in Omaha,” he said. “This facility will be an incredible enhancement to our mission.”

In March, the Iowa-incorporated company Sunterra Farms Iowa, and its affiliates, Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. were accused in U.S. District Court by one their lenders, Compeer Financial, of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme.
Compeer Financial is suing the three companies, which are run by the Price family of Yankton County, South Dakota. The companies are responsible for extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, with their parent companies based in Canada.
At Compeer’s request, a federal judge has appointed a receiver, Hannah Walkes of Pipestone Management II, to take control of the companies’ operations and ensure that Compeer’s collateral – 110,000 head of swine located in 54 barns in and around Yankton County – are fed and cared for. Walkes told the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Wednesday the pigs, which are destined for slaughter, are being properly cared for and are no longer at risk.
The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra Farms Iowa.
Bank: Family blamed CEO Ray Price for check kiting
In its lawsuit, Compeer claims that the Price family companies have engaged in a “long-running fraud” that involves check-kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.

Compeer alleges the transactions have had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest. Compeer claims that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed in February, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions between accounts with Compeer and Canadian Western Bank.
According to separate court filings by Canadian Western Bank in the Court of King’s Bench in Alberta, the “core guiding minds” of the defendant companies are CEO Ray Price, along with Douglas, Glen, David and Art Price — all of whom are directors and shareholders of various members of the Sunterra group of companies.
According to the Canadian bank, the Price companies issued checks that vastly exceeded their actual holdings — meaning none of the companies, at any point, had the actual cash on hand to pay the face value of the checks. The total amount of money circulated as a result of the alleged check-kiting scheme over a nine-month period exceeded 7 billion Canadian dollars, or 4.9 billion American dollars, the bank claims.
In Canadian court filings, Canadian Western Bank alleges that at a meeting on Feb. 24, 2025, Art and Glen Price “made various clear and unequivocal statements” indicating the overdrafts were caused by CEO Ray Price, with whom they were “upset and disappointed.”
Not long after that meeting, however, the Price family allegedly refused to allow Compeer and the Canadian bank to share information as they investigated the matter.
‘Contempt of court’ issue is raised by receiver
While case in Canadian court has advanced, conflicts have arisen in the U.S. District Court proceedings involving Walkes, the newly appointed receiver tasked with taking control of the Price family companies.
According to documents filed with the court by Walkes, she went to the Sunterra Farms Iowa offices in Beresford, South Dakota, on the morning of March 31 to gather financial information. She alleges that while she was logged onto Sunterra’s online accounting platform, she noticed “all information regarding accounts receivable, accounts payable and general ledger were missing.”
A short time later, she told the court, she received “a message that we had been entirely kicked out of the accounting platform.” After logging back in, she alleged, she discovered that information — including data she had previously accessed — was missing.
“I have serious concerns that the data is being destroyed or manipulated,” Walkes told the court, asking that the Price family companies be required to show cause as to why they shouldn’t be held in contempt of court.

Court records show an attorney for Walkes sent an email to Sunterra’s lawyers, stating, “Someone knew that the receiver was on site and reviewing accounting information, and information and data started disappearing at the same time, which is a direct violation of the court’s order.”
An attorney for the Price companies wrote back to Walkes’ attorney, questioning those claims and asking, “Will this type of aggression take place at every turn or will the receiver act in the best interest of all parties as it is required?”
Four days later, Walkes updated the court on the situation, indicating some of the issues had been resolved and that while she still didn’t know whether some data had been removed, she believed she had gained access to enough information to manage the accounts for two of the three companies — Sunwold and Lariagra.
However, she told the court, with regard to Sunterra Farms, that company functions as the management entity for the other two, and after she attempted to run financial reports for Sunterra, they “reflected all zeros. The Sunterra Farms journal entries were blank where financial information used to exist.”
In that same update to the court, she indicated that she had just learned the Sunterra information had been restored, but she still was unable to access information pertaining to the Price family’s parent companies in Canada. Walkes asked the court to clarify her authority to gain access to that information.
In response, Sunterra and its affiliates argued Walkes had no “permission to reach across the border into Canada to look at information not belonging to” the companies.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Eric Schulte gave lawyers for Sunterra and its affiliates to until the end of day Wednesday to file “an unequivocal declaration” that no evidence had been destroyed or manipulated.
As for the receiver’s access to information on the Canadian parent companies, Schulte gave the companies’ lawyers the same deadline to request a protective order that articulated the “reasons why they believe such information should be protected from disclosure.”

Or should it bend its 'fiscal guardrails'? Or both? The debate is on.","Gov. Ned Lamont and legislative leaders agree that state dollars should be used to blunt the big cuts in federal aid Connecticut is facing.
But with a recession also looming that could punch more holes in state finances, how much can Connecticut spare?
Set aside too little, and officials might have to watch hundreds of thousands of residents lose Medicaid coverage while poor cities boost taxes to offset vanishing federal aid.
Set aside too much and Connecticut could tumble unprepared into the next economic downturn. The last time that happened it triggered three major state tax increases between 2009 and 2015.
“You know me, I’m not a tax-raising guy,” Lamont said Wednesday afternoon. 
The governor, a fiscal moderate, is taking a wait-and-see approach. Connecticut has a record-setting $4.1 billion rainy day fund, enough to cover 18% of annual operating expenses. And while President Trump and Congress are eyeing Medicaid reductions that could cost this state more than $500 million annually, the federal aid Connecticut has lost to date has been smaller.
“There’s some storm clouds out there, absolutely,” Lamont added. “I see what’s going on out there. We’re able to manage … This is no time to panic.”
But the governor’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority want to line up two lines of defense:

The rainy day fund should be earmarked for its its traditional purpose, to offset losses in tax revenues in the event of a recession. This would enable lawmakers to postpone tax increases and cuts to vital programs potentially for years until the economy recovers.


And one of Connecticut’s most controversial budget caps, which has drained an average of $1.4 billion or 6% from state services annually since 2017, would be scaled back, so legislators could replace some vanishing federal dollars with state funds. 

Currently, that $1.4 billion, which represents a portion of annual income and business tax receipts, must be used to reduce the state’s considerable pension debt, which stands at about $35 billion. That’s in addition to the $3.2 billion in required payments to the pension funds Connecticut already makes each year.
Though the $4.1 billion rainy day fund represents a record high for Connecticut, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, warned Wednesday it could evaporate fast if it’s drained to counter both a recession and federal aid cuts ordered by President Trump.
“Four billion dollars,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, “could go so quickly that people’s heads will explode.”
Connecticut’s experience with its last recession supports Ritter’s argument that the rainy day fund may not be enough to cushion the pain of an economic downturn and unprecedented cuts in aid from Washington.
Between 2007 and 2009, what economists called the “Great Recession” slashed Connecticut’s income, sales and other General Fund tax receipts by 10%, according to annual financial records from the comptroller’s office.
With Lamont’s budget office projecting tax revenues this fiscal year at nearly $21.1 billion, a 10% hit would represent more than $2.1 billion. In other words, an economic downturn alone could exhaust the rainy day fund in two fiscal years.
And the same revenues that plunged the most in the last recession, tax receipts tied to capital gains and other investment earnings, are at risk again. Wall Street has slumped dramatically in recent months as investors fear new tariffs imposed by Trump will push inflation upward. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which measures the performance of 30 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S, rebounded Wednesday after several recent hits but is still down 4.2% so far this calendar year.
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, noted that state government’s recovery from the last recession took far longer than two years. Connecticut struggled with sluggish recovery growth and frequent deficit projections until 2017, eight years after the Great Recession ended. 
“Everything resets at a lower level,” she said.
Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Democrats aren’t looking to abolish budget controls, which supporters called “fiscal guardrails,” or end savings efforts entirely.
“It’s not about doing away with the ‘guardrails’ completely,” Rojas said. “It’s doing what the law allows us to do, which is respond to an emergency.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, echoed the concerns of House Democrats, saying Connecticut almost certainly hasn’t taken its hardest fiscal hit from Washington.
“Things are changing day by day,” Looney said. “We’ve never seen anything like this before.”
And although the Republican-led Congress hasn’t finished work on a new federal budget, Trump already has used executive orders to unilaterally cut or freeze significant aid previously awarded to Connecticut.
About $155 million in public health grants, most of which Connecticut planned to spend in the next fiscal year, was canceled in late March. At the same time, Trump froze another $14 million earmarked for K-12 school districts here.
Those moves, though significant, pale in comparison to the hit Connecticut could face if Congress meets its goal of slashing $880 billion from programs serving states, most of which is expected to come from Medicaid.
Washington currently sends more than $6 billion annually to Connecticut through Medicaid, an entitlement program that serves roughly 1 million people here, funding health coverage for poor children and adults, nursing home and other elder care, and behavioral health and substance abuse treatment services.
State officials have modeled various Medicaid cut projections, based on proposals circulating on Capitol Hill, that could cost Connecticut anywhere from $186 million per year to $880 million.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a fiscal policy think-tank based in Washington, projected that cuts tied to new work requirements alone could put 549,000 Connecticut residents at risk of losing Medicaid coverage. 
Lamont has noted on several occasions that Connecticut cannot afford to offset all losses state finances may feel in the coming years and that it is better prepared than most other states for the fiscal chaos to come.
A recent analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts ranked Connecticut 14th-highest out of 50 states in terms of the number of days it could run government using its budget reserves alone.
And Lamont isn’t the only one reluctant to temper savings efforts and prepared to rely on the rainy day fund alone, for now, to protect Connecticut’s finances.
Republicans in the General Assembly say Connecticut should focus now on ways to cut state spending, not on tampering with budget caps.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said Lamont needs to resist appeals to supplant vanishing federal aid with state dollars. 
“The focus is on you now. Stand strong against your fellow Democrats who want to break the ‘guardrails,’” Harding said.
“We should not be dismantling the ‘guardrails’ that have protected Connecticut from overspending, protected us from tax increases,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who said he fears Democrats are pushing the state toward more tax hikes.
But some say Connecticut ultimately will need more revenue to deal with both an economic downturn and shrinking federal aid. And if revenue is needed, it must be accompanied by reforms to a state and municipal tax system that disproportionately falls on the poor and middle class.
“Connecticut has given our ultra-wealthy residents and major corporations a free ride for far too long, all while working families foot the bill,” Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a progressive grassroots organization of dozens of faith, labor and other civic organizations, said Wednesday. “There’s no more critical of a time than now … to create new revenue that is both sustainable and equitable.”
Connecticut’s last tax fairness study, issued late year, found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and two-and-a-half times the statewide average.
Lamont has consistently opposed raising taxes on the state’s highest earners, arguing it would prompt them to flee the state.
The head of Connecticut’s largest health care workers union, SEIU District 1199 New England President Rob Baril, last week also urged state officials to ask more from the state’s wealthiest households and major corporations to preserve core services.
“I don’t see a way that Connecticut can provide even the status quo, which is insufficient,” Baril said, “unless we’re able to do some stuff around revenue.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_509-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House advanced its two-year spending plan Wednesday despite sharp criticism from the chamber’s Democrats. The House’s version of the operating budget nixes several of the governor’s policy priorities and helps fund a new stadium for the Cleveland Browns.
The bill also walks back of some the House’s initial plans, but only slightly.
A proposal to force property tax reductions on the back of school district rainy day funds will allow administrators to carry over 30% of their budget instead of 25%. Budget drafters are scrapping a new population-based system for distributing library funding, but they’re not giving up on moving to a dollar figure appropriation instead of a percentage of the general revenue fund.
With Wednesday’s vote, the budget now moves to the state Senate, where lawmakers are sure to roll out on their own slate of changes. They’ll have time to mull it over as lawmakers leave for a two-week Easter recess.
The 2026 fiscal year begins on July 1; lawmakers have until then to finish off the budget.
Stadium funding skirmish
Ohio House Finance Chairman, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R- Ashville, kicked off testimony, describing how the spending plan eliminates taxes from the governor’s proposal and spends $4.4 billion less in state money.
Those tax increases in governor’s proposal would’ve paid for a $1,000 child tax credit and a new fund for future stadium deals.
Instead, House Republicans favor a $600 million bond package in support of Cleveland’s proposed facility. “It is the most conservative stadium funding proposal in America,” Stewart insisted, arguing tax receipts from the project will pay back the debt. He went on to offer an amendment increasing from $38.5 million to $50 million a deposit paid by Brown’s ownership.
And that’s about where things went off the rails.
Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, piped up with an amendment to Stewart’s eliminating the bond package entirely.
Rather than letting that Brennan proceed, House Speaker Matt Huffman ordered the chamber to stand at ease for several minutes. When session resumed, Huffman quickly called a vote despite Democratic lawmakers’ objections and points of order.
In the confusion, many Democrats didn’t wind up voting on the amendment at all. It passed 55-15.
Schools, property taxes, libraries and Medicaid
Ohio House GOP budget proposal slashes public school funding

Many Democrats objected to a K-12 funding model that abandons the so-called fair school funding plan lawmakers have been working toward in the last two budget cycles. State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, said that setting aside that formula returns to an ad hoc funding approach the Ohio Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional.
“This proposal is leading Ohio students and taxpayers back down a path of artificial guarantees, back to square one, back to residual funding, back to the days where school (funding) was based not on what it cost to educate a child, but what the General Assembly decides that it feels like paying for education.”
While school districts worry about how much funding is coming in, they could also have to consider how much is sitting on their balance sheet. The budget would direct county officials to pare back the property taxes which support schools if a district maintains a balance worth more than 30% of their annual budget.
“We are saying that government is not a piggy bank,” state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, argued, criticizing those carryovers as a poor return on taxpayers’ investment.
State Rep. Jack Daniels, R-New Franklin, defended the changes to library funding. He said “no agency is entitled to an increase,” and that making appropriations based on a percentage of the general revenue fund amounts to an “obligation.” And he complained the budget isn’t actually cutting dollars to libraries.
“They feel they’re being cut, when in fact, we are not cutting,” he said. “We’re just not providing the increase they expect.”
Notably, the Ohio Library Council determined the House proposal would appropriate at least $40 million less each year than the governor’s proposal.
Democrats also worry that the budget locks the state into radical changes to the Medicaid program if federal government makes even modest reductions to its 90% share of the program.
“If federal funding drops even slightly, say from 90% to 89% the entire program would be ended,” Rep. Rachel Baker, D-Cincinnati said. “That’s right, a 1% cut in federal funding would terminate the program that provides health care access to almost 800,000 Ohioans.”
Rep. Stewart downplayed the likelihood of federal changes, but argued the state expanded the program on the promise that the federal government would cover 90% of the program.
Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland, meanwhile praised the budget for “push(ing) back against the wokeness we are facing by prohibiting Medicaid funds from being used for discriminatory DEI programs and establishing a statewide policy recognize that there are only two sexes.”
Final tally
Rep. Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati said, “We are not the sexiest state, but that’s not what makes Ohio so special.”
Ohio doesn’t have beaches or mountains to draw people in, but it can offer quality of life.
“People move here because they want to start family, they want to buy a home, they want to send their kids to a great school,” he said. But with the House proposal, lawmakers “are failing to meet those basic benchmarks.”
“The only piece of this budget — that is big and complicated — that got the full breadth of the creativity of this body,” he argued, “is a $600 million subsidy for billionaires who own a failing sports team,”
In his closing remarks, Rep. Stewart dismissed Democrats’ criticism.
“You know how many GRF general revenue fund dollars that are being spent for the Cleveland Browns in this budget?” he said. “Zero — zero, not one dollar.”
Stewart concluded the House proposal represents more money than the current budget for K-12 schools, higher ed, child care, and libraries. The measure would also amount to more than $4 billion in property tax relief — the largest, he said, in state history.
“Voting no on this budget means you are voting against all of those things,” he said. “That’s a tough vote, folks. Voting no on this budget is a master’s class in missing the forest for the trees.”
In the end, five Republicans voted against the proposal, but it still passed easily 60-39.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas Senate committee voted down a bill that would have extended Medicaid coverage for women 12 months after giving birth if they do not already qualify for the state’s Medicaid expansion program.
House Bill 1004 passed the House April 1 with a bipartisan 71 votes but failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on a split voice vote Wednesday. More than half of births in Arkansas are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance system for low-income Americans.
Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program covers people up to 138% of the federal poverty level, but since Jan. 1, 2023, Medicaid covers pregnant Arkansans with incomes of up to 214% of the federal poverty level, or about $45,200 for a family of 2 or $68,700 for a family of four. This coverage expires two months after birth, leaving many postpartum Arkansans to “fall through the cracks,” said Sen. Breanne Davis, a Russellville Republican and HB 1004’s Senate sponsor.
Davis mentioned that Arkansas has one of the nation’s highest maternal mortality rates and the third highest infant mortality rate. Maternal mortality is measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth.
“We have got to address this holistically, and I think there’s been a lot of really good work done, but it has not included this group of women,” who do not qualify for Medicaid expansion, Davis said.
Extending postpartum Medicaid coverage has the support of legislative Democrats, and House Minority Leader Andrew Collins of Little Rock sponsored House Bill 1008, which is similar to HB 1004 but has not been heard in committee.

Arkansas maternal health care landscape needs more coordination and teamwork, physicians say

 

Without the policy outlined in the bills, Arkansas remains the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth, according to KFF.
Davis told the Public Health committee that the bill was “narrowly tailored” and would not create any “duplicative” services.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam said repeatedly last year that 12-month postpartum Medicaid would be “redundant” and “duplicative,” since the state has other insurance coverage options for postpartum low-income Arkansans. A maternal health task force convened by Sanders did not include the 12-month policy in its September 2024 list of recommendations to improve the state’s maternal health care landscape.
State Medicaid officials Janet Mann and Elizabeth Pitman expressed DHS’ opposition to HB 1004 Wednesday. Mann mentioned that DHS estimated it would cost more than $11.2 million to add 10 months of coverage to existing programs.
DHS’ assessment of the bill’s overall fiscal impact states that the federal government would cover more than $8.8 million of the cost, leaving the state to cover less than $2.4 million. Davis told the committee that Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funds would support the proposed coverage extension.
From July 1 to Dec. 31, 2024, roughly 60% of postpartum Arkansans remained Medicaid-eligible after the 60-day limit, according to two quarterly reports that a 2024 law requires DHS to submit to the Legislature. Putnam and Mann presented the first report in October, and the Advocate received the second report from DHS in February via a public records request.

Arkansas DHS officials say they want to find insurance for low-income, Medicaid-ineligible new moms


Of the 1,787 women who did not qualify for Medicaid past 60 days postpartum between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, 42% of them had income above 138% of the federal poverty level, and 38% were not U.S. citizens, according to DHS’ second quarterly report.
By July 1, Arkansas’ Medicaid program will include presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant Arkansans, reimbursements for doulas and community health workers and pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage for specific treatments, Mann said Wednesday.
In February, Sanders signed the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act to put these policies into effect. The legislation had bipartisan sponsorship, including from Davis and HB 1004’s House sponsor, Knoxville Republican Rep. Aaron Pilkington.











One day we’ll get these women covered, and I’m sure people will ask what took so long.


– Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, House sponsor of HB 1004



 Public testimony

The five Arkansans who spoke in favor of HB 1004 were all Black women; Arkansas’ Black maternal mortality rate more than doubled from 1999 to 2019, according to a 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Extending postpartum Medicaid coverage is essential for “helping families heal and remain together,” said Stephanie Garner, CEO of the Arkansas River Valley Area Council, a Russellville-based assistance organization for low-income families.
“Substance use disorders and mental health conditions don’t resolve in two months,” Garner said. “When coverage ends, I’ve seen women relapse, return to unsafe environments or even lose custody of their children, not because they didn’t want to get better, but because they lost access to care that was helping them recover.”
Danielle Wright, a single mother from Jackson County, said she lost Medicaid coverage after having her third child via an emergency Caesarean section that led her to seek mental health care.
“At one point [I was] even finding myself crying in a DHS office because I was having to prove a difficult moment that I was not ready to experience and relive in that moment,” said Wright, who also supported HB 1004 before the House Public Health committee in March.
Maternal mental health “cannot be separated” from maternal health as a whole, and untreated mental health issues during pregnancy can lead to poor birth outcomes and increased maternal mortality, therapist and social worker Mackenzi Foreman said.

Foreman and Arkansas Birthing Project executive director Zenobia Harris both said they have worked with women who unexpectedly lost their Medicaid coverage while they were pregnant.
Latoya Morgan said she supported HB 1004 on behalf of her friend, Helena Stanton, who died after the complicated premature birth of her third child.
“Shortly after giving birth, Helena began experiencing severe difficulties with her mobility, struggling to move her limbs and ultimately [to] breathe,” Morgan said. “She didn’t have access to a doctor until it became an emergency because she didn’t have access to Medicaid.”
After the committee voted down the bill, Morgan expressed frustration with the outcome in an interview, saying DHS officials and the majority of the committee lacked empathy for low-income pregnant Arkansans.
“[Lawmakers] claim to be Christians and believers of Christ, but you’re unwilling to take care of all of the people, the sick, the women that create life… because of what, funding?” Morgan said. “Because it’s not your sister, because it’s not your wife, because it’s not your daughter?”
A 2023 bill similar to HB 1004 never received a committee hearing, and Pilkington was the House sponsor of both bills. He said Wednesday that he was disappointed HB 1004 did not advance.
“I promised that I wouldn’t leave these women behind, and I did all I could,” he said. “The fact that I had to fight back against so many lies was the most disheartening part about this whole process. One day we’ll get these women covered, and I’m sure people will ask what took so long.”

In March, the Iowa-incorporated company Sunterra Farms Iowa, and its affiliates, Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. were accused in U.S. District Court by one their lenders, Compeer Financial, of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme.
Compeer Financial is suing the three companies, which are run by the Price family of Yankton County, South Dakota. The companies are responsible for extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, with their parent companies based in Canada.
At Compeer’s request, a federal judge has appointed a receiver, Hannah Walkes of Pipestone Management II, to take control of the companies’ operations and ensure that Compeer’s collateral – 110,000 head of swine located in 54 barns in and around Yankton County – are fed and cared for. Walkes told the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Wednesday the pigs, which are destined for slaughter, are being properly cared for and are no longer at risk.
The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra Farms Iowa.
Bank: Family blamed CEO Ray Price for check kiting
In its lawsuit, Compeer claims that the Price family companies have engaged in a “long-running fraud” that involves check-kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer alleges the transactions have had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest. Compeer claims that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed in February, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions between accounts with Compeer and Canadian Western Bank.
According to separate court filings by Canadian Western Bank in the Court of King’s Bench in Alberta, the “core guiding minds” of the defendant companies are CEO Ray Price, along with Douglas, Glen, David and Art Price — all of whom are directors and shareholders of various members of the Sunterra group of companies.
According to the Canadian bank, the Price companies issued checks that vastly exceeded their actual holdings — meaning none of the companies, at any point, had the actual cash on hand to pay the face value of the checks. The total amount of money circulated as a result of the alleged check-kiting scheme over a nine-month period exceeded 7 billion Canadian dollars, or 4.9 billion American dollars, the bank claims.
In Canadian court filings, Canadian Western Bank alleges that at a meeting on Feb. 24, 2025, Art and Glen Price “made various clear and unequivocal statements” indicating the overdrafts were caused by CEO Ray Price, with whom they were “upset and disappointed.”
Not long after that meeting, however, the Price family allegedly refused to allow Compeer and the Canadian bank to share information as they investigated the matter.
‘Contempt of court’ issue is raised by receiver
While case in Canadian court has advanced, conflicts have arisen in the U.S. District Court proceedings involving Walkes, the newly appointed receiver tasked with taking control of the Price family companies.
According to documents filed with the court by Walkes, she went to the Sunterra Farms Iowa offices in Beresford, South Dakota, on the morning of March 31 to gather financial information. She alleges that while she was logged onto Sunterra’s online accounting platform, she noticed “all information regarding accounts receivable, accounts payable and general ledger were missing.”
A short time later, she told the court, she received “a message that we had been entirely kicked out of the accounting platform.” After logging back in, she alleged, she discovered that information — including data she had previously accessed — was missing.
“I have serious concerns that the data is being destroyed or manipulated,” Walkes told the court, asking that the Price family companies be required to show cause as to why they shouldn’t be held in contempt of court.
Court records show an attorney for Walkes sent an email to Sunterra’s lawyers, stating, “Someone knew that the receiver was on site and reviewing accounting information, and information and data started disappearing at the same time, which is a direct violation of the court’s order.”
An attorney for the Price companies wrote back to Walkes’ attorney, questioning those claims and asking, “Will this type of aggression take place at every turn or will the receiver act in the best interest of all parties as it is required?”
Four days later, Walkes updated the court on the situation, indicating some of the issues had been resolved and that while she still didn’t know whether some data had been removed, she believed she had gained access to enough information to manage the accounts for two of the three companies — Sunwold and Lariagra.
However, she told the court, with regard to Sunterra Farms, that company functions as the management entity for the other two, and after she attempted to run financial reports for Sunterra, they “reflected all zeros. The Sunterra Farms journal entries were blank where financial information used to exist.”
In that same update to the court, she indicated that she had just learned the Sunterra information had been restored, but she still was unable to access information pertaining to the Price family’s parent companies in Canada. Walkes asked the court to clarify her authority to gain access to that information.
In response, Sunterra and its affiliates argued Walkes had no “permission to reach across the border into Canada to look at information not belonging to” the companies.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Eric Schulte gave lawyers for Sunterra and its affiliates to until the end of day Wednesday to file “an unequivocal declaration” that no evidence had been destroyed or manipulated.
As for the receiver’s access to information on the Canadian parent companies, Schulte gave the companies’ lawyers the same deadline to request a protective order that articulated the “reasons why they believe such information should be protected from disclosure.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cafo_hogs_kent_becker_us-geological-survey.jpg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved a bill that would allow some people serving long prison sentences to have their cases reviewed.
SB 156, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, allows people who were sentenced under the Habitual Felony Offender Act to have their cases reviewed and have the chance to be released from prison if they did not commit a crime that caused physical injury.
“These individuals, if this bill goes into effect, would have served at least, hear me now, at least 25 years for an offense where there was no physical injury,” Barfoot said to members of the House Judiciary Committee. “We routinely sentence and send people to prison for much less time for violent offenses such as murder and robbery.”

The Habitual Felony Offender Act, enacted in 1977, required the state to impose a life sentence on anyone convicted of a Class B felony who had three prior felony convictions on their record, and life without parole for anyone convicted of a Class A felony.
The law is widely considered to be a major driver of the state’s prison overcrowding crisis. The Legislature in 2000 approved changes to the law that gave judges more flexibility in sentencing, but the changes were not retroactive.
Barfoot’s bill only applies to individuals sentenced to life without the possibility of parole prior to May 2000, when the Legislature approved the changes. Those with anyone convicted for homicide, a sexual offense or attempted murder would not be eligible for review.
Those who are eligible may file to have their cases reviewed in the county where they were sentenced. Notices will then be sent to relevant parties such as prosecutors, victims as well as the Attorney General’s Office that will then review the filing to determine if the person is eligible.
If the applicant is determined to be eligible, the court will review the case to consider if the person should be resentenced based on specific factors: the underlying offense, how the person behaved while incarcerated in prison, the person’s age and the likelihood the person will be successful after being released from prison.
The bill requires those eligible for review to file a request by October 2030.
It was the House’s first opportunity to consider the legislation after the Senate took two rounds of votes to eventually get the measure approved. House members voted down the measure during the 2024 session.
The House Judiciary Committee approved an amendment during the committee that allows the Attorney General’s Office to review a person’s petition for a case review, but also the relevant details in the indictment, and have the agency speak to the case.
“This would be a safeguard to ensure that, if someone has pled to a lesser charge based off of the details of the crime, the relevant indictment would have details if there are elements that would preclude you from being eligible in this law by having the AG review the indictment,” said Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster, who introduced the amendment.
It also states that the district attorney of the jurisdiction where the court will review the sentencing will have “weighted consideration” for the petition to have the sentence reduced.
The amendment also requires that data be collected regarding the crimes and convictions for the petitions that were filed, the counties that received the petitions and other information pertaining to petitioners.
Barfoot’s bill narrowly survived a vote in the Senate chamber in March when a majority of Republicans voted against the proposal, and it failed in the first vote 16-16. After nearly two hours, the legislation was reconsidered and passed by a vote of 17-8.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, filed a nearly identical proposal in previous sessions but was never enacted. During the 2024 session, his legislation was approved in the House Judiciary Committee, but Republicans voted to block the legislation on the House floor.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, publicly opposed the legislation, telling the committee that the bill goes beyond giving people a second chance, but five chances to be released from prison after committing an offense.
“I firmly disagree that someone who has three prior felonies, and one of those prior felonies being a Class A felony, who gets out and commits another one of those offenses that I have named to you deserves more of a chance to continuously come to the court, and continuously drag victims through the process,” Simpson said.
Elaine Burdeshaw, policy director for Alabama Appleseed, said people are serving sentences that are longer than those who commit violent crimes, and that challenges the notion of justice.
“Current sentencing practices, people can be convicted of much more serious violent crimes, and they are serving less time,” she said in an interview with the media following the meeting.
Darlene Hutchinson, a victim advocate, said she is not taking a position on the legislation, but is grateful that the bill was modified to take into account the impact it has on victims.
“It allowed for victims to be heard, but there was zero victim notification in it,” she said. “And I am fanatical about victim notification. My question to legislators then was, “How are victims going to be heard if they are not even going to be notified if their case was coming back to court.”

Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, sent a letter to Gov. Dan McKee Wednesday urging him to establish “free trade zones” under the powers granted to the governor by King Charles II in 1663. The document that established the colony of Rhode Island allowed free trade with colonies throughout the world.
“Our state has a long history of resisting unfair authoritative trade mandates and taxes,” McNamara wrote. “One only has to reflect back on our 252-year history to be reminded of the action that our early colonists took in 1772 when faced with an unlawful British vessel.”
He was referring to the HMS Gaspee, the British revenue schooner assigned to patrol Narragansett Bay that ran aground in Warwick and was plundered and burned by a group of colonists led by merchant John Brown.
McNamara suggests that the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation explore establishing trade agreements with international car manufacturers and creating a free trade zone within the Quonset Business Park in North Kingstown, one of the top 10 automobile importers in the U.S.
He pointed to the new air cargo terminal under construction at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport as an ideal location for duty-free imports and proposed that the Port of Providence be renamed the “Free Trade Port on the East Coast.”
McKee spokesperson Andrea Palagi acknowledged a request for comment, saying that a formal response would be sent from the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation.
The Commerce Corporation did not immediately respond to an inquiry.

Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, walks away from the lectern after presenting a piece of legislation to the House State Affairs Committee on Jan. 7, 2025, at the State Capitol Building in Boise.

It’s not a secret that some Idaho lawmakers delete their emails and text messages — which are public records when they relate to legislation and other official business, according to state law. 
But they rarely admit it publicly. 
Rep. Barbara Ehardt bucked this trend last week, in an attempt to bring some levity to a tense House debate over a bill that would restrict diversity, equity and inclusion on college and university campuses. 
The debate occurred Thursday, the penultimate day of a hectic legislative session. Ehardt, an Idaho Falls Republican who has long opposed DEI, said that she had received text messages from people “at the universities” who supported Senate Bill 1198. Then she addressed Statehouse reporters who were watching the debate and might want to see the messages.
“I’m gonna delete (them),” Ehardt said with a laugh. “Don’t put in the FOIA request.” 
Half an hour after the House approved the anti-DEI bill, Idaho Education News hand-delivered a public records request to Ehardt. 
Too late. The messages were gone.  
Ehardt later told EdNews that her comment “was all meant to add a little levity” on the House floor. When asked why she didn’t want reporters to see the messages, Ehardt said that the authors may not have expected their texts to be public.
“No one’s anticipating that that’s going to get shared,” she said. “Obviously, if I hadn’t said anything, nobody would have known.”
State law exempts from disclosure personal communications by a member of the Legislature, but communications related to “the conduct or administration of the public’s business” are considered public. In other words, someone who messages a lawmaker about a bill shouldn’t expect that it will remain private.
While Ehardt’s stunt was clearly meant to be funny, it raised a more serious question: Why are lawmakers allowed to destroy public records?
Unlike the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which applies to federal agencies, the Idaho Public Records Act doesn’t have a retention provision that bars destroying records before a certain period of time. 
  Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, makes an announcement from the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
State agencies adhere to a schedule — created by the Idaho State Historical Society — that guides how long various types of records should be retained, and local governments set their own guidelines. But similar rules don’t apply to the Legislature. 
Lawmakers can trash their records at any time, unless someone files an official request to see them. Destroying records after they’ve been identified in a request would violate the Public Records Act, but Ehardt didn’t appear to do that in this case. 
Still, her decision to delete the texts is a good example of why the state needs more specific retention requirements, said Scott McIntosh, First Amendment committee chairman for the Idaho Press Club. 
“The decisionmaking process of state legislators is the public’s business and should be done in public,” said McIntosh, who is also opinion editor for the Idaho Statesman. “Deleting text messages cited by a lawmaker during a legislative debate is anathema to the Idaho values of open and honest government.”
Journalists and other members of the public often rely on correspondence records to shed light on government work that happens behind closed doors. Here are some recent examples from EdNews:

Emails between West Ada School District administrators and trustees exposed internal turmoil after the district told a teacher to remove a classroom sign promoting inclusivity.
Messages between Idaho State University President Robert Wagner and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, revealed that ISU is considering the feasibility of buying a private medical school in Meridian. 
Public comments on a divisive bill to fund private education using tax dollars showed widespread opposition to the proposal that was ultimately signed into law. 

On Tuesday, Ehardt declined to share details on the messages, except that they were from people affiliated with multiple universities and they weren’t from students. Ehardt said she will retain EdNews’ records request, however. 
“I did scan and copy and save that for time and all posterity,” she said.

Jason Nemes shared their views on the 2025 legislative session with the Louisville Forum Wednesday. (LRC Public Information photos)LOUISVILLE — Two Kentucky legislative leaders — one Republican, the other a Democrat — offered sharply divergent views of the 2025 legislative session that ended March 28.
“It’s the good, the bad and the ugly and that’s the truth,” said Sen. David Yates, D-Louisville, the Senate minority whip, speaking at Wednesday’s monthly meeting of the Louisville Forum, a nonpartisan public interest group.
Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Middletown and House majority whip, had a different take on accomplishments of the Kentucky General Assembly, where Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers.
“I think this was the second-best session in the history of Kentucky,” Nemes said, adding it was surpassed only by legislative accomplishments of last year, when lawmakers enacted a new, two-year budget. Nemes was elected to leadership in November 2022.
The one-hour session moderated  by WHAS11 reporter Isaiah Kim-Martinez at times grew animated as the lawmakers discussed legislation affecting taxes, Medicaid, abortion, transgender medical care, the environment and the need for more transparency in legislative proceedings where bills sometimes are subject to last-minute revisions.
The Kentucky League of Women Voters and other outside groups have criticized Kentucky lawmakers for routine “fast-track” maneuvers that provide little to no time for public scrutiny.
“We need to do better,” Nemes acknowledged. “I’m not making excuses. We could do better.”
Yates agreed, saying changes to bills came through so fast on the final days of the legislative session that copies were still hot from the copying machine. Lawmakers should do better, possibly by making changes available immediately on the legislative website, he said.
“The technology is there,” Yates said, adding that as a member of leadership, he found himself trying to explain last-minute changes to Senate Democrats even while the vote was underway. “I think we could definitely do better.”
‘Distraction’ bills
Yates also criticized the 2025 session for focusing too much on cultural issues including banning Medicaid coverage for transgender health services; limiting such care for  inmates; and cancelling Gov. Andy Beshear’s restriction on “conversion therapy,” a controversial practice aimed at gay youth that Yates called “barbaric.”
Lawmakers also enacted, over Beshear’s veto, House Bill 4 banning diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, measures at public colleges and universities.
Yates called them “distraction bills,” adding, “We should focus on legislation that moves Kentucky forward.” Critics have referred to such measures as “hate bills.”
Nemes disputed the critics’ characterization.
“There were no hate bills this session,” he said.
Limits on public funds for transgender services were simply meant to ensure no “taxpayer dollars” would be used for such care — not as an attack on the small fraction of Kentuckians who identify as transgender, he said.
“If you’re a transgender person, I want happiness for you,” Nemes said. “I love you and I want you to be very successful.”
As for conversion therapy, licensing boards for professionals such as psychologists and social workers can establish standards to prevent conversion therapy if they choose, Nemes said.
‘We got it done’
KY doctors say GOP lawmakers’ attempt to clarify abortion ban confuses instead

Other issues the two touched on include a last-minute addition to a bill to attempt to define when physicians can perform emergency abortions. Abortion is banned by state law except to save the life or prevent disabling injury to a pregnant person.
Nemes defended changes he made to House Bill 90, his bill that also allows free-standing birth centers. It adds to state law a list of certain conditions under which doctors can legally end a pregnancy, such as hemorrhage or ectopic pregnancies, but critics have said it still leaves pregnant patients at risk and doctors at risk of prosecution.
Nemes disagreed with criticism of the changes to state abortion law he acknowledged were rushed through.
“We got it done and I’m proud of it,” he said. “I’m not proud of the process but we got it done.”
Yates, a lawyer who handles personal injury cases, said he’s still not sure the changes would protect physicians or pregnant women.
“Everyone hopes that is the case,” he said. “We’ll see.”
As for other accomplishments, Nemes cited House Bill 775, a sweeping measure changed late in the session to include changes to Kentucky’s tax law and make it easier to lower Kentucky’s income tax, an ongoing effort by Republican lawmakers.
It also includes economic incentives for Louisville aimed at downtown development, Nemes said.
“We’re putting our money where our mouth is,” Nemes said. “I am very bullish on the General Assembly and how it’s treating Louisville.”
Yates said the legislature needs to proceed with caution as it works to cut the state income tax.
“In the event it goes down to zero,” he said, “I promise there will be other taxes.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-2-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797
,DC,2025-04-09 22:43:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump attack on state climate laws likely doomed, but attempts to yank funds may be next",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-attack-state-climate-laws-likely-doomed-attempts-yank-funds-may-be-next,,"An executive order President Donald Trump signed Tuesday to block state-level renewable-energy initiatives set off alarm bells among climate advocates.But experts and state policy groups said constitutional protections will blunt any effect the order would have on state operations.The order, one of four Trump signed Tuesday aiming to revitalize the coal industry, directs the U.S. Justice Department to investigate and block enforcement of state laws that restrict fossil fuel production. It specifically targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions — popular among blue states.By attempting to strip states of their own authority to make and enforce laws, the order violates basic constitutional principles and would likely be struck down in court, environmental law experts said Wednesday.Brad Campbell, the president of the New England-based environmental advocacy group Conservation Law Foundation, said in an interview with States Newsroom the order does not cite any federal law or interest the administration is seeking to protect — though the order does mention interstate commerce and an objective to improve national security — revealing it is more about messaging than policymaking.“This is political theater more than it is law,” Campbell said. “It completely disregards the understanding of federalism that has been in place for centuries and the language of the Constitution itself.”While the order itself may be unlikely to withstand legal scrutiny, it signals the administration could make demands about climate policy that would have to be obeyed at risk of losing federal cash, advocates said.Trump officials already have shown an eagerness in their first months for using federal funding as leverage with states, universities and other institutions that are outside the federal government’s control.In a statement, White House spokesman Taylor Rogers said Wednesday the order would protect against states assuming the power to regulate international issues like climate change.“The President is right to ensure that Americans in both red and blue states are not beholden to State overreach stifling American energy that are unconstitutional or contradict federal law,” she said.Climate action ‘irreconcilable’ with Trump agendaThe order includes a lengthy preamble attempting to justify federal involvement in state and local policymaking, while also noting that state policies focusing on emissions reductions and climate protections are at odds with Trump’s goals.“These State laws and policies try to dictate interstate and international disputes over air, water, and natural resources; unduly discriminate against out-of-State businesses; contravene the equality of States; and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification,” the order’s opening section reads.“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy.  They should not stand.”At the Tuesday signing ceremony for the order and three others on coal production, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf told the president that states promoting renewable sources of energy were a major part of the coal industry’s decline.“One of the biggest problems we have in this space is Democrat states, radical leftist states, enacting policies and enacting an agenda that discriminates against coal, against secure sources of energy,” Scharf said.The order, though, does little to change the market and technological forces that have led to the coal industry’s decline, Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director of the environmental group Western Environmental Law Center, said Wednesday.“I just don't see how the order … is going to do anything but create confusion and uncertainties for communities that are transitioning away from coal right now,” he said.“In many respects, it does an injustice to those communities by giving them a false sense of hope that somehow coal mines and coal-fired power plants are suddenly going to be resurrected from the dead or be pushed well beyond their economic and technological lifespan.”States undeterredEnvironmental lawyers and climate advocates said the order does not change the constitutional structure of the U.S. government that empowers states to set their own laws.Casey Katims, the executive director of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 governors seeking to prioritize state-focused climate policy, said the group’s members would not be moved by the order.“The reality is that states continue to enjoy broad, independent constitutional authority to advance solutions to meet the needs of communities, businesses and workers,” Katims said in a Wednesday interview. “The president cannot change the Constitution by fiat.”The group’s co-chairs, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, said in a Tuesday statement the administration had no power to block state authority and the coalition would be undeterred by the order.“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” they said. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”If the Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, sues to stop enforcement of state laws, courts would likely reinforce states’ well-understood power to govern themselves, Campbell said.Even the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a conservative supermajority that includes three members appointed by Trump and has shown deference to even the most controversial actions of his second presidency, would move to restrain that federal power, Campbell predicted.“I think the notion that the president can stop enforcement of state laws that don’t align with his political program will be too much of an overreach even for this very Trump-friendly Supreme Court majority,” he said.Further, he said, even Republican governors, whose party has traditionally advocated for increased states’ rights in relation to the federal government, might object to the intrusion of the executive branch into state policymaking. Allowing action under the order would set a precedent for a future Democratic president to meddle in Republican states, he said.Federal fundingThe lack of legal authority to directly block enforcement of state laws may not keep the Trump administration from exercising power in another way: withholding federal funds from uncooperative states.The order signals the administration, which has been bold in asserting a power to deny congressionally appropriated funding, could target states over climate policy, Schlenker-Goodrich said.“Do they have a legal basis? Not really,” he said. “Can they use political weapons, in particular relative to funding, against states that are stepping up on climate action? That is very much a possibility. That is the direction you will see the White House going.”",,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)As firearm-related deaths of young people in New Mexico increase, the state’s senior senator in Congress introduced two pieces of legislation on Wednesday intended to address gun violence.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is co-sponsoring the first bill, called the GOSAFE Act, which would regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic firearms. He introduced the same legislation in 2023.
Heinrich is also co-sponsoring another bill, called the BUMP Act, which would ban the sale of “bump stocks” and other devices or modifications that convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic ones.
“For too long, Congress has failed to stem the onslaught of mass shootings,” Heinrich said in a statement. “As a sportsman and gun owner, I’m committed to upholding the laws that protect responsible gun ownership, but we must do more to prevent deadly weapons from reaching those who are all too ready to turn them against our communities.”
Heinrich introduced the legislation less than three weeks after a mass shooting in Las Cruces, New Mexico’s second-largest city, which left three dead and 15 others injured. Four people have been arrested so far in connection to the shooting, including a 20-year-old and three teenagers, according to local police.
Firearm-related deaths among children and teenagers in the U.S. increased by 50% between 2019 and 2023, Stateline reports. In 2023, firearms remained the leading cause of death among young people in the U.S. for the fourth year in a row, according to the latest mortality data released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In New Mexico, 33 firearm-related deaths occurred among people under 18 in 2023, a 24% increase from 2019, the data show. The state experienced a slight decrease in 2021, but the number of deaths increased in 2022 and 2023, the data show.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

Miranda Viscoli, co-president of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence, applauded Heinrich for introducing the bills in a statement on Tuesday, saying he is “leading the charge for gun violence prevention in New Mexico and across the country.”
“The GOSAFE Act will help make our communities safer from gun violence,” Viscoli said in a statement. “These highly lethal firearms have no place in civilian hands.”
The BUMP Act, Viscoli added, will “bolster our legal framework that makes it possible for law enforcement to address the epidemic of violence that New Mexicans have experienced through guns modified to be fully automatic.”
A single legislative committee approved a similar proposal to change New Mexico state law in the most recent legislative session, but the bill never received a vote in either chamber of the New Mexico Legislature.
Heinrich said the bills represent a continuation of the work Congress did by passing the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which enabled licensed firearms dealers to check FBI records to see if a gun offered for sale was stolen, mandated checks of juvenile criminal history and mental health records of people under 21 trying to buy a gun, and created new crimes for “straw purchases” of guns on behalf of someone who isn’t allowed to have one, among other reforms.

Ford Carr, D-Wichita, reviews evidence in a complaint against him during an April 9, 2025, investigative hearing. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A six-member House Select Investigating Committee on Wednesday split votes along party lines and failed to reprimand, censure or expel Rep. Ford Carr for his behavior that included an altercation in a Topeka bar.
Instead, the committee of three Democrats and three Republicans voted 5-1 to write a report for the House about the committee’s failure to reach agreement, potentially recommending Carr, a Wichita Democrat, be admonished. Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence, was the lone no vote. The committee will reconvene to approve the report before it is sent to the House, as there was some disagreement about asking for an admonishment of Carr.
It wasn’t the result Carr expected.
Pointing to a complaint he filed against Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican, Carr said the only options presented were dismissal, reprimand, censure or expulsion.
“It angers me,” he said. “None of these were options when it was Rep. Hoheisel.”
Carr said he expected the committee to split votes 3-3 and send the complaint to the House, where it would require a two-thirds vote to take action. Admonishment had never been on the table, he said.
Whatever the term used, Carr said the committee’s determination won’t change him.
“I represent my people the way I represent my people,” he said. “I am in no way going to alter the way I represent my people.”
He added, referring to the fact he retained his seat after last year’s election: “The people have already spoken. I am going to continue to be me.”
Carr has contended that racism and lack of acceptance for a Black man who operates in a different culture fueled the complaint and investigation, all of which the complainant denied immediately in a statement to the committee.
Rep. Leah Howell, a Derby Republican, filed the complaint alleging that Carr broke a House rule about using disorderly words while debating legislation. Listed in her complaint were multiple instances that she said indicate Carr’s behavior is not in line with the decorum and conduct required of a Kansas representative.
“I want to clarify that this complaint is not about retaliation, partisan politics or personal conflicts,” she said. “Contrary to accusations that this complaint is racially motivated, the color of skin and political party have absolutely nothing to do with my decision to file this complaint.”
Howell pointed to an altercation at the Celtic Fox in Topeka in which video surfaced of Carr and Wichita City Councilman Brandon Johnson loudly arguing and calling each other names. When Rep. Henry Helgerson, an Eastborough Democrat, tried to intervene, he was knocked to the floor, although he refused to press charges. Howell, who is married to a Wichita city councilman, said she considered Carr’s words at the Celtic Fox to be threatening. She focused on several incidents that she said make a pattern.
“I will argue that accusing colleagues of racism, calling one of them a racial slur, lying to this committee and that infamous public display of repeated use of racial slurs and aggression by what should be described as an act of battery against two other elected officials can be collectively classified as not only misconduct, but a pattern of violent rhetoric and behavior,” Howell said.

Carr, during his 15 minutes speaking to the committee, disagreed with Howell’s assessment of what happened in each of the instances she described.
“Not by any stretch of anyone’s imagination is it OK for someone white to explain to me my culture and what I should be doing,” he said. “It is not your place to tell me what I’m supposed to do culturally as a Black man.”
He also explained to the committee the cultural difference between the words “n*****” and “n***a,” the second of which he said he was using in conversations the committee and complainant highlighted.
“Not once did I use the word n*****,” Carr said. “That’s not a word that we use in my culture. That is erroneous.”
Carr also brought out his birth certificate and pointed out that his race was identified as “Negro” on the Kansas document.
Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, and others on the committee questioned Carr extensively about a comment he made in 2023 on the House floor about a “House Negro,” which brought Carr an admonition from GOP leadership. But the committee ultimately agreed that incident didn’t apply to its considerations Wednesday, except seeing his behavior as part of a pattern.
Ultimately, the committee agreed that expulsion was off the table, commenting that such a move was usually connected to a criminal act. Members debated the difference between censuring and reprimanding, but a vote on reprimanding split 3-3 on party lines.
Even the idea of writing a report caused some contention, as Humphries waffled at the idea of writing a report that didn’t show any concerns with Carr’s behavior.
“I seconded the motion, but I’m not comfortable with a report that does not say that we made a finding,” Humphries said. “We made a finding that we are not going to dismiss, reprimand, censure or expel. Is there any agreement on this committee that there was behavior that was inappropriate?”
“Maybe you don’t want to say it publicly,” she added.
The committee didn’t indicate when it would reconvene to approve the report.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4090592-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The width and breadth of Kansas Reflector journalism was recognized in the annual Kansas Press Association contest results announced Wednesday.
From business reporting to commentary to overall recognition, a swath of Reflector reporters, editors and contributors shared the 16 awards in the Division VII category. The task of writing these award summaries has fallen to me over the years, and you might think that the excitement fades, but it hasn’t yet. Being part of this staff and effort to bring free, nonprofit journalism to the Sunflower State remains a spectacular privilege.
Editor in chief Sherman Smith was named Kansas journalist of the year, his third time winning that award since founding the Reflector in the summer of 2020. He also won first place in the series category for coverage of the Marion County Record newspaper raid anniversary. He shared that award with independent journalist Marisa Kabas.
Former Reflector and Missouri Independent reporter Allison Kite and Stateline’s Kevin Hardy won first place for local business story.
Finally among the first place finishers, opinion contributors Eric Thomas and Mark McCormick were both recognized for column writing. I’m delighted to see Eric and Mark recognized for their determined, consistent and ever-readable pieces. I finished third in the category, which translates to a Reflector sweep of the top three finishers.
“I have the best job in the world because I get to work with all my favorite journalists in a tireless quest to speak truth to power and lift Kansans’ voices,” Smith told me Wednesday evening.
I couldn’t agree more.

Further staff members were honored with an array of second-place finishes. Reporter Anna Kaminski received the distinction for her entry in the military story category, while former reporter Rachel Mipro placed for an environmental story. Mipro departed in July, and Kaminski arrived in August. Working with both has been a joy.
Now we come to an eternally tricky piece of any awards story. That would be the writer covering his or her own awards. I placed second for journalist of the year for the second time in a row. In this case, however, I’m right behind Smith. I’m sure I’ll never hear the end of it. I also finished second in editorial writing.
Other Kansas Press Association awards for Kansas Reflector staff included:

New Journalist Award: Third place, Anna Kaminski
Investigative Story: Third place, Sherman Smith
Education Story: Third place, “‘Unapologetically loud’: How student journalists fought a Kansas district over spyware and won,” Sherman Smith
Column Writing: Third place, Clay Wirestone
Column Writing: Third place, Max McCoy
Best Story/Picture Combination: Third place, “Kansas elementary school students plant exclusive sweetgum that traversed the moon,” Sherman Smith
Military Story: Third Place, “Bill protecting Kansans veterans from ‘claim sharks’ vaporized after flat tax failed,” Sherman Smith

Each year I repeat some variant on the journalistic truism that no one does these jobs for awards. The most important recognition I receive comes from our readers, both in person and through email. But only the must curmudgeonly of codgers would refuse such distinction when offered.

Laura Kelly weighs in on new vehicle license plates, pollution at industrial park and expansion of voluntary water conservation program.","Rep. Shannon Francis, R-Liberal, said he appreciated a bill signed by Gov. Laura Kelly allowing creation of a distinctive license plate honoring Future Farmers of America  because it was important to nurture ""leadership skills among youth and preparing them for careers in agricultural science, business and technology."" (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly gave the green light to creation of distinctive license plates celebrating National Future Farmers of America and the Route 66 Association of Kansas in addition to introduction of an edgy, sleek and minimalist blackout plate for discriminating motorists.
Sales of the FFA and Route 66 plates, like other nonprofit organizations imprinted on Kansas license plates, directly benefit the respective foundations. Benefactor of the blackout-style plate tied to a special $50 fee would be the Kansas Department of Revenue. The agency said it would earmark fee revenue from blackout plates, which have white lettering on a dark background, to pay costs associated with replacing outdated plates.

“Increasing the options available for distinctive license plates is a simple way to allow Kansans to show off their interests and values on the road,” said Sen. Ethan Corson, a Democrat from Johnson County.
Rep. Shannon Francis, a Republican from Liberal in southwest Kansas, said expansion of the state’s collection of specialty license plates was a chance for Kansans to express support for organizations they cherished. He said the new batch was no exception.


“One plate in this bill supports the Future Farmers of America, an organization that has profoundly impacted generations of Kansans,” Francis said. “FFA plays a crucial role in nurturing leadership skills among youth and preparing them for careers in agricultural science, business and technology.”
On Wednesday, Kelly said enactment of House Bill 2201 would also streamline the process of issuing Kansas license plates. The bill also modified documentation requirements for military license plate applications.


 Pesticide pollution

Meanwhile, Kelly signed House Bill 2169 to clarify state law on remediation of pesticide pollution on commercial property in Johnson County. The legislation resulted from a request from a representative of Astra Enterprise Park, which is home to Panasonic’s $4 billion advance battery production facility in De Soto.
The measure would limit a state agency’s ability to issue soil, groundwater or surface water cleanup orders to owners of non-residential property previously owned by the U.S. Army in Johnson County. The restriction would apply to land where pesticide products were distributed near buildings on Army property prior to 2005. An ammunition plant was in operation at the site for decades, but it is being developed as a large business park.
However, the bill says the property owner would be responsible for soil and water remediation if the property was converted to residential use or for construction of a child-care facility.
In the House, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment testified the bill would restrict the agency from investigating contaminants, lead to inconsistent enforcement standards and could prompt use of the land for residential purposes without restrictions.
Kelly also signed House Bill 2255 to expand acreage of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. The objective was to improve water conservation in the Upper Arkansas River corridor from Hamilton County to Rice County. State-enrolled CREP acres would expand to 60,000 acres from the current 40,000 maximum.
Under the voluntary program, a producer could receive rental payments and other incentives to retire state water rights on enrolled acres. The aggregate total number of acres in all CREPs in a single Kansas county couldn’t exceed 20% of the statewide acreage cap.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Francis-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

It was part of the annual AICUP (Association of Independent Colleges & Universities of Pennsylvania) Day at the Capitol.
They travelled from over 25 schools to help convince lawmakers to continue or increase funding financial aid programs that support students in the state attending private schools like theirs.
“Programs like PHEAA [Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency] and Ready to Succeed are the reason I can stay at my school and have the opportunity to speak on its behalf today,” Dustin McMullen, a 21-year-old Seton Hill student, said in the rotunda. “I stand here today, and I urge policy makers and stakeholders to continue investing in programs like PHEAA and ready to succeed.”
He said the crowd, made up of fellow college students, administrators, lobbyists and journalists, was larger than his class at Rocky Grove high school in Franklin, which graduates around 60 people every year.
  Dustin McMullen at the capitol in Harrisburg for AICUP Day (Capital-Star photo by Ian Karbal)
McMullen, a first-generation college student, told the Capital-Star that he likely would not have been able to attend college without financial assistance. But with state funding, he’s enrolled in a unique program, the early acceptance medical program, where he’s obtaining a liberal arts degree, with a seat in Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine’s grad program awaiting him when he graduates. His goal is to become an anesthesiologist.
For him, it was important to come to Harrisburg and advocate on his and other schools’ behalf. Before his speech, McMullen and the other students met with lawmakers and legislative staff members to stress the importance of continued financial aid for students attending private college. 
“I’m an RA, a resident assistant, at Seton Hill. So I see residents who struggle with finances, but thanks to these financial aid programs, they’re able to come and get the opportunity that they wouldn’t get at other places.”
Tom Foley, the president of AICUP, which represents 85 schools, stressed the importance of funding education at independent colleges. And part of that, he said, is dispelling myths about the kinds of students private schools attract
“I think most people assume that low income kids are all in publicly-funded schools,” Foley said. “But actually, the majority of them are in these schools.”
According to data provided by AICUP, out of all students working towards bachelor’s degrees in Pennsylvania, 46% of lower-income Pell Grant-eligible students attend independent schools. That also includes  47% of students receiving PHEAA grants, and 52% of underrepresented minority students seeking both bachelor’s and advanced degrees.
Collectively, 275,000 students seeking four-year degrees attend AICUP schools.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Foley said that he doesn’t predict a decline in funding from the state legislature for student financial assistance programs, but is worried about the impacts of the federal government’s moves to slash funding at some universities around the country.
In March, Foley wrote a letter to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, warning about the potential impacts of proposed funding cuts to research programs at colleges and universities, including 35 AICUP member schools. Now, he’s worried what will happen to direct student aid.
“We’re very concerned,” he said. “But we can’t tell yet. When they’ve talked about higher education in the new administration, they always say, ‘We’re going to protect Pell Grants. We’re going to protect the student aid programs.’ Hopefully, that is the case.”
Olivia Fabiano, a senior at Elizabethtown College, also made the trip to the Capitol. . 
Like McMullen, for her, this is personal. Fabiano said she likely would not have been able to afford tuition at the school without financial assistance, especially with other college-aged siblings and a brother with costly medical needs.

“I think it’s important for everybody to have that equal opportunity to receive the higher education that they know they deserve,” Fabiano said. “There shouldn’t be a financial burden holding a student back from pursuing any sort of college, or the one that they want to be at.”
She was drawn to Elizabethtown over other state-owned and state-related schools because of the small class sizes. She had been able to attend a private middle school because her mom worked there, and attributed the level of individualized attention she could receive to her social and academic success.
Coming to Harrisburg, Fabiano felt that communicating her lived experience to lawmakers would be more effective than AICUP just providing them with statistics. And it was a chance to see first-hand how the process works. As a marketing student, she hopes to land a job at an advocacy organization, or in government, where she feels that she’s working towards positive change. 
“I’m very interested in doing marketing for something like this, in politics,” Fabiano said. “I’m actually having coffee with someone on [Governor Josh] Shapiro’s communications team because it’s so interesting to me.”
Dashawn Sheffield, another student who travelled to Harrisburg, felt it was important to tell lawmakers how much financial assistance meant to him. He said financial aid programs, like the Ready to Succeed scholarship, along with four jobs on and off campus, are the reason he is able to attend Lafayette College. It was his second year attending an AICUP day at the capital. 
“These grants do not just fund education,” Sheffield told a crowd in the rotunda. “They fuel opportunity, ambition and success.”
  Dashawn Sheffield speaks at the Capitol in Harrisburg for AICUP Day (Capital-Star photo by Ian Karbal)
Another reason he wanted to be on hand is because of his fascination with politics — he’s double majoring in government and international politics. And, in his spare time, he advocates for campaign finance reform in Pennsylvania.
“I’ve always known I wanted to be a politician of some sort,” Sheffield said. “I am really looking to make a large-scale impact one day.”
For him, two years of coming to Harrisburg to advocate for low-income students like himself helped build that resolve.
“It really strengthened that for me, being able to experience firsthand testifying, giving a speech, and also speaking to the legislators,” Sheffield said. “I’m leaving knowing I was a voice for many different students like me.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3562-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

(Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)This story originally appeared in the Arizona Mirror.
The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker. 
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement.

Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers are one debate away from adopting two bills backed by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen meant to increase online safety for minors and curb student phone use at school.
Senators on Wednesday, by voice vote, advanced Legislative Bill 504, the “Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act” by State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. It would require online services to explicitly protect minor users and their personal information in the physical design of certain applications or websites, including social media.
LB 504’s goal is to tackle rising youth social media use and harms such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, bullying, harassment, stalking, suicide and more.

Bosn, a former deputy county attorney in Lancaster and Saunders Counties and a mother of four young children, said the online services covered under her bill profit off of users’ data, including from screen time, clicks or purchases. She added that families know the importance of bills such as LB 504 and how difficult it is to stay ahead of an “ever-changing online world.”
The bill is about public safety, Bosn explained, comparable to car seats, toddler beds, training wheels, helmets and high chairs.
“We think about safety features in every other product we provide to our most vulnerable,” Bosn said. “So why wouldn’t we make every effort to make kids online safer?”
Specifics of the bill
Under LB 504, “qualified online services” are those that:

Conduct business in Nebraska.
Determine the purposes and means of processing users’ personal information.
Have annual gross revenue over $25 million, adjusted every other year for inflation, at least 50% of which is derived from the sale or sharing of personal user data.
Buy, receive, sell or share the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices each year.

Online services with “actual knowledge” that fewer than 2% of users are minors (up to age 18) would be excluded from the act, as would federal, state, tribal or local governments for design features “in the ordinary course of its operations.” 
Should Bosn’s proposal conflict with one or more other laws, “the law that affords the greatest protection from harm to minors shall control.”
State Sens. Terrell McKinney and Margo Juarez, both of Omaha, both spoke in favor of Bosn’s bill and said it was important to have guardrails in place for children.

Juarez, a former school board member for Omaha Public Schools, said she imagined she would have appreciated the guidance if she had dealt with such social media influences when her children were younger.
Children and teens using these online services would need to be treated differently online than adults, requiring easy-to-use and accessible tools, such as for parents up to their child’s 13th birthday, to crack down on:

Screen time.
A minor being able to communicate with other users.
Other individuals being able to see a minor’s personal data.
The operation of all design features, including to opt-out of any “unnecessary” features.
Personalized recommendations, allowing an opt-in for a chronological info stream rather than one based on user activity.
In-game purchases or other transactions, placing limits or prohibiting such activity.
The sharing of the precise geolocation of the minor and providing obvious notice of such tracking.

Targeted advertising of minor users would also be prohibited on qualified online services. So would notifications or push alerts from such online services between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. during the school year, and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays during the school year.
Bosn’s proposal also prohibits “dark patterns” from being used on minors. These are user interfaces “designed or manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making or choice.” This could include features that influence user choices often without the awareness of what they are consenting to, such as tracking or targeted ads.
First Amendment concerns
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, as he did when the bill was first debated in February, said he had “philosophical concerns” but also legal questions over whether LB 504’s requirements would be constitutional under the First Amendment right of free speech.

Dungan’s largest concern was that the bill would require these settings to be default. He cited a recent case in California where a similar law was put on pause.
“I believe that in order to be compliant with the First Amendment, it is important that we not curate the speech that is being made by these private actors,” Dungan said.
Bosn said requiring the default settings would add some “teeth” to the law.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, noting he has four children almost the same age as Bosn’s, said he appreciated the changes that Bosn made for the second-round debate as a “step in the right direction.”
Cavanaugh said that while he shared concerns about social media and taking action, he was concerned about “injecting the government from a top-down approach.”
“I think there are concerns people raise [that] young people should be entitled to some level of their own privacy about their thoughts and things like that,” he said. “I don’t know where you draw that line.”
‘Sit this one out’
Bosn said she made multiple changes after talking with opponents, but that while she tried multiple times to work with Dungan and Cavanaugh, they hadn’t engaged. She criticized the duo, who are both attorneys, for saying they agreed with the premise but in effect saying, “We’re just not there yet.”

She called that “a little disingenuous.”
“Maybe you should sit this one out,” Bosn said. “Either have the courage to come and say, ‘These are the changes we want made,’ … or don’t bother.”

Bosn said one senator who previously raised concerns, State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, worked on the bill before Bosn filed an amended version about one week ago.
“If you’re not going to read it and you’re not going to come and talk with me about your concerns, please don’t stand here and patronize me and say, ‘I really support your efforts,’” Bosn said.
‘Rules of the Constitution’
Bosn said she had removed a main provision of her bill similar to an issue raised in the California case, even though she said she disagreed with those concerns.
That language would have required qualified online services to implement features to prevent compulsive usage, severe psychological harm (including anxiety and depression), severe emotional distress, “highly offensive intrusions on reasonable privacy expectations,” identity theft, discrimination or other injuries.
The amended bill would also no longer require online services to treat all users as a minor without until it is known that the user is not one. Online services would also not be required to issue an annual compliance report.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Dungan said he had to “respectfully dispute” that the Nebraska and California proposals were substantively different and apologized if his concerns had come off as patronizing.
“It still addresses the same underlying issue, which is that it seeks to regulate speech in a way that is overly broad,” Dungan said. 
Dungan said he thought the bill was a “good idea, but, unfortunately, we do have to adhere to the rules of the Constitution.”
An effort by Dungan to remove the “default settings” language from Bosn’s bill failed 26-10 against his amendment. Bosn’s amendments to her bill were approved 45-0.
Student cellphones and social media
LB 504 is one of four proposals backed by Pillen and Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers this spring that addresses online safety for minors.
A second bill, advanced Tuesday by voice vote to a third and final round of debate, LB 140 by State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, would require each of the state’s 245 public school districts to prohibit student use of personal electronic devices, such as cellphones, on school grounds or at a “school instructional function,” like a field trip. 
Most school districts already have such policies, and districts would retain wide latitude in approving the places and times when such devices could be used.
The other bills are LB 383, from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, and LB 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Storer’s “Parental Rights in Social Media Act” advanced 6-1 from the Bosn-chaired Judiciary Committee, with LB 172 amended in.

LB 383 would prohibit anyone from creating social media accounts without first verifying their age after Jan. 1. One method of age verification could be a digital ID card. Minors (up to age 18) could not create an account without clear parental consent. 
Hardin’s LB 172 would update existing state laws against child sexual abuse material to outlaw computer-generated images of child pornography.
Storer has designated LB 383 as her 2025 priority bill. It hasn’t yet been scheduled for debate.
‘Stand up for our kids’
Bosn’s LB 504 would take effect Jan. 1 if passed. Civil violations could be enforced by the Nebraska AG’s Office, up to $50,000 for each violation. The bill would include funding for a new assistant attorney general, or about $150,000 each full fiscal year.
Companies would have a six-month “grace period” to comply with the act, or until July 1, 2026.
Bosn said “red flags” over youth online activity have been flying from educators, medical professionals, law enforcement, judges, parents, grandparents, guardians and children who she said were acknowledging problems and asking for help. 
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers nationwide have been doing just that, Bosn added.
“This is the time to stand up for our kids,” Bosn said. “This bill is a common sense opportunity for this body to demonstrate the political will to protect Nebraska children online.”

According to students [&#8230;]","KSU students rally to support resource centers branded as DEI. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSome Kennesaw State University students say they will lose access to things like free menstrual products, foods from their home country or a sense of belonging at their university if the school follows through with plans to shut down student resource centers, apparently as part of an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push.
According to students and faculty, programs on the chopping block could include initiatives for LGBTQ students, students of color, women, Latino students and aimed at promoting cultural awareness. The university has held meetings with students to discuss the proposed changes.
The university’s assistant vice president of communications, Tammy DeMel declined to answer emailed questions or clarify which resources may be on the way out, instead sending a statement:
“As KSU works to follow all federal and state regulations and the policies of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, we’ll continue to support the needs of all students and help them access the resources they need to succeed.”
Several dozen students gathered on the campus green Wednesday did not feel reassured. Protesters organized by Students for Socialism, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation marched around the school carrying signs and chanting slogans like “Say it loud, say it clear, resource centers will stay here.”
Freshman chemistry major Celeste Vincent said she’s used the resource centers and that they can be a godsend for students who didn’t get support back home, and that attempts to take them away feel hateful.
“Some people, it’s all they have,” she said. “They don’t have family, they don’t have friends, they don’t have the resources to reach out to people. They have this, and they want to take it away. Why? Why? Because they hate them, they hate kids, they hate the new generation. These kids paid good money to be here. They worked their asses off to graduate high school. They come here every day and they pay and they sit in their classes and they try to do their best. And the one support that we get, we’re told, you can’t have that because you’re less than. That’s what it boils down to.”
Grace Blomberg, a student and organizer, said some students feel like they’ve been subjected to a bait and switch.
“Students coming from rural parts of Georgia who in their schools had never seen a pride flag, had experienced lots of aggression, came and did tours and saw a center with pride flags up, and they immediately felt welcome, they immediately felt safe,” she said. “So that, I think, is a major factor in why students might choose KSU, and students are on tours currently right now, KSU may not be disclosing that the centers that they’re passing by won’t be here in the fall when they come to school.”
Other students who did not want their names published out of concern for retribution said the centers have provided them with services like menstrual products, contraception and information on women’s health. Students said the LGBTQ resource center provided clothes for transgender students allowing them to wear things their parents would not approve of, and other centers provide halal foods for Muslims and other foods that could be hard to find in the states.
Some students on the green Wednesday were less attached to the resource centers. Sophomore exercise science major Jack McFadin, who said he proudly voted for President Donald Trump, said he’s not opposed to all of the services the centers provide like counseling for students in need of help, but he said he is strongly opposed to DEI because he says it undermines merit-based achievements.
“I think as far as counseling resources go, I don’t really care because it doesn’t affect me,” he said. “But if it is DEI and it is just giving people scholarships because ‘I identify as this,’ then I think that’s a bad thing for the future of our country.”
In an executive order released in January, President Donald Trump sought to eliminate DEI, including from schools and colleges, calling it a way to peddle “dangerous, demeaning and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.”
Sara Giordano, an assistant professor in KSU’s department of interdisciplinary studies, said some feel like the school administration is caving to the Trump administration without putting up a fight.
“(Students) came back saying, ‘oh, KSU told us their hands are tied, they have to comply, and they’re doing this because of federal and state guidance, federal and state policies,’” Giordano said. “The problem is that none of these policies are in writing. There’s actually nothing that says any of these centers are illegal. These centers serve a lot of our students. Our students are devastated by the threat of them closing.”
“Universities, quite frankly, I think are using this – KSU is using this – as an excuse to close down student centers because of a conservative agenda,” she added.
A statewide ban on DEI in schools failed to pass in this year’s legislative session but could return when lawmakers come back to the Gold Dome in January.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images)The State of New Mexico’s inactive rule requiring school districts to have a minimum of 180 instructional days on their calendars per school year is back in the courts.
The New Mexico Public Education Department in March appealed a February decision from Ninth Judicial District Court Judge Dustin K. Hunter, who ruled that the department’s rule requiring a minimum number of instructional days in the calendar was unenforceable. Hunter wrote in his decision that the rule conflicted with a current Public School Code statute that requires instead a minimum number of instructional hours.
Hunter’s ruling came in response to an April 2024 lawsuit from the New Mexico School Superintendents Association and many school boards from across the state challenging PED’s original calendar rule, announced in March 2024. The rule itself was a response to the signing of House Bill 130 during the 2023 session, which requires K-12 schools to have a minimum of 1,140 instructional hours each year. Hunter granted an injunction in that case in May 2024, so the rule has never been enforced.
According to court documents, the state claims the judge erred in several ways in making his decision. First, the appeal contends Hunter was wrong to limit the scope of the department’s rulemaking authority and erroneously used outside evidence to determine legislative intent. The state also asserts in its challenge that no conflict exists between the rule and current statute.
Stan Rounds, executive director of the New Mexico School Superintendents Association, a plaintiff in the original case, told Source NM that their team chose legal counsel to represent them in these next court proceedings just last week and are prepared to respond to the state’s claims over the next several months of the process.
The Legislature attempted to codify the district court’s February decision during the recent session through House Bill 65, which would have clarified that local districts have the authority to set the number of school days in their calendar, as long as it meets the instructional hours requirement.
HB65 passed in both chambers, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed the bill. The House voted to overturn the veto, but the Senate did not reciprocate due to lack of time on the last day of the session, so the governor’s veto still stands. 
Source reached out to the governor’s office for comment on the court proceedings and a spokesperson referred us to the governor’s veto message, which states that Lujan Grisham is concerned with some instances in which school districts have condensed school calendars. Lujan Grisham also mentions concern about “shortchanging” New Mexico students, particularly in light of the landmark Yazzie-Martinez lawsuit, which found that the state was not providing equitable educational opportunities to at-risk students.
“We weren’t surprised that she vetoed [HB65],” Rounds told Source. “There may be other opportunities for [lawmakers] to consider the override at some point in the future.”
Whitney Holland, president of the American Federation of Teachers’ New Mexico chapter, told Source that the back-and-forth on the state education department’s rule is “frustrating” and disregards the intent of current laws. The teacher’s union supported the plaintiffs in the original lawsuit through an amicus brief. She said it feels as though schools, students and teachers are getting caught in the crosshairs of a larger political battle.
“The legislative intent is to give our school districts and our places of learning that local control and that ability. So I think it’s insulting to that,” Holland said. “This kind of back and forth on will we, won’t we…I think it’s really destabilizing a little bit, and it’s hard to do any longterm planning. 
Michael Chavez, superintendent of Hatch Valley Public Schools, told Source that he does not believe more school days lead to better student outcomes but, rather, it’s the quality of instruction that counts. He added that especially in smaller, more rural districts, everything from instructional days and class schedules to transportation is tied together. 
Opponents of longer school years have also raised concerns for rural and tribal schools and the costs associated with added instructional days. 
“It really boils down to how effective is your instruction, what goes on in your classroom on a day-to-day basis,” Chavez said.

(Photo by Alex Kent/Getty Images)The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced Wednesday it would begin screening immigrants’ social media activity for “antisemitism,” formalizing a process it has already used to deport hundreds of international students. 
The Department of Homeland Security, which houses Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said in a press release that those applying for permanent resident status, international students and non-citizens affiliated with schools “linked to antisemitic activity” would be affected immediately. It would also consider “physical harassment of Jewish individuals.” 
“[Secretary Kristi] Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism – think again. You are not welcome here,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a media release. 
First Amendment groups immediately hit back against the announcement. 
“By surveilling visa and green card holders and targeting them based on nothing more than their protected expression, the administration trades America’s commitment to free and open discourse for fear and silence,” the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a college free speech organization, posted on social media. “Unfortunately, that chill appears to be the administration’s aim.” 
“When the federal government starts talking about people ‘hiding behind the First Amendment,’ look out,” FIRE attorney Will Creeley added on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. 
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last month the State Department had revoked over 300 student visas from international students, many of whom engaged in pro-Palestine demonstrations that have swept college campuses. 
President Donald Trump’s administration has taken a hard line against universities where students have protested Israel in the nearly 18 months since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack in which some 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed and more than 250 people kidnapped. The incident which kicked off a war between Israel and the extremist organization. Since then, nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the United Nations, mostly women, children and elderly people. 
Trump and other Republicans have painted the largely peaceful protests — and support of Palestine in general — as antisemitic. His administration has threatened 60 universities, including Tulane in New Orleans, with the revocation of federal funding if they fail “to protect Jewish students on campus.” 
Several schools, including Cornell, Princeton and Columbia, have had millions in federal funding paused or revoked in an attempt to influence their campus policy. 
Many of the students arrested had no criminal records, with their attorneys alleging they had been arrested for engaging in peaceful protests. In one case involving a Tufts University student who Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swarmed and arrested, supporters say her alleged offense was authoring an opinion piece for a student newspaper in favor of Palestinians. 
USCIS will consider social media content that indicates the user “endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity” in its analysis when considering immigration requests.

Bobby Kauffman, R-Wilton, spoke at a subcommittee meeting Jan. 27, 2025. He and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs introduced an updated version of their property tax proposal following public feedback on the bill. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An overhaul of Iowa’s property tax system would begin sooner and allow local governments to collect more revenue in times of high inflation under updated legislation released Wednesday by the Republican chairmen of the Legislature’s tax-writing committees.
Senate Study Bill 1227, and its companion House Study Bill 328, make changes to House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208, the companion bills introduced in early March by Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, the chairs of the Ways and Means committees in the House and Senate.
The original legislation, as well as the updated version, would repeal Iowa’s “rollback” system for calculating property taxes, in which only a portion of residential property taxes are taxable. The taxable portion is a percentage of the property’s market value, calculated each year growth of statewide taxable properties and limited by an aggregate value growth of 3%.
The legislation replaces the rollback with a “revenue-restricted” system by allowing taxation of the full assessed value of a property, but limiting the amount of new tax revenues local governments can collect. Most property tax levy rates could increase each year by no more than 2% under the bill, with exceptions for new construction.
While the initial proposal phased out the rollback system over five years, the new bill proposes eliminating this system of calculation immediately, in fiscal year 2027. The new version of the legislation also allows local governments to exceed the 2% limit — allowing up to 5% increases for most property tax levy rates — during times of high inflation, as determined by increases in the consumer price index (CPI).
In a news release, Dawson and Kaufmann stated the property tax proposal includes a “minimum budget guarantee to provide small communities certainty in their budgeting process.” The measure also includes an increase to the homestead property tax exemption benefit from a proposed $25,000 in the initial bill to $50,000.
Some of these changes — like allowing for greater levy rate increases during inflationary periods — were brought up during subcommittee meetings on the legislation by advocates representing local governments. Dawson said the new version of the legislation came out of discussions and suggestions on the original bill.
“When we filed our original bill, we were looking to get it out to the public so we could start receiving feedback and input, and the bill filed today is a result of that feedback,” Dawson said in the release. “… These updated proposals continue our goal of rebuilding the property tax system to bring relief, and bring more predictability and transparency to taxpayers, local governments and businesses.”
Concerns about other portions of the proposal raised by local government representatives, like changes to tax increment financing (TIF) revenues and the shift of $426 million in K-12 schools from property taxes to the state, were not addressed by the amendment, remaining the same in the new legislation.
The new property tax bill has not been scheduled for a subcommittee as of Wednesday. In interviews with reporters and at meetings, Kaufmann has repeatedly stated that his goal is for the measure to pass during the 2025 legislative session, while giving time for feedback and alterations as needed. Republican leaders have echoed this sentiment, while saying that they want to ensure the bill will have its intended impact of lowering property taxes while allowing local governments to continue providing needed services.
Senate President Amy Sinclair told reporters earlier in August that “we want it done right, rather than fast.”
“For me, it’s a priority to get done this session,” Sinclair said. “But if it doesn’t get done this session, it’s because …  we didn’t have all the details in place to get it done right.
Kaufmann said in a statement on the updated property tax bill that the measure will provide needed relief from rising property tax costs.
“With assessment letters coming out, Iowans have been louder than ever with their concerns about property taxes,” Kaufmann said. “Iowans have expressed their concern, rage, and fear about unpredictable increases and their ability to afford staying in their homes. We are working to provide real relief to Iowans and their families, make Iowa a competitive state to live, and deliver a property tax overhaul that focuses on property taxpayers.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kaufmann-scaled-e1738013694429-1024x691.jpg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

“Let me be clear: executive orders will be followed and enforced in the state of New Jersey,” Alina Habba, the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on social media Tuesday.
Habba was taking aim at a March 24 memo from New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Pat Callahan telling state police personnel that the New Jersey Immigrant Trust Directive bars police from arresting people solely based on immigration status and prohibits them from sharing information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The memo notes the directive differentiates between an administrative warrant, which is issued by a federal agency like ICE, and a judicial warrant, signed by a judge.
“Taking law enforcement action by arresting a subject based solely on an ‘Outstanding Administrative Warrant’ would violate the Attorney General’s Immigrant Trust Directive referenced above,” Callahan said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by the New Jersey Monitor.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond for further comment. State Police spokesman Trooper Charles Marchan said the memo “speaks for itself.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he has made detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants a top priority of his second term in the White House. His crackdown on immigration has gone beyond migrants, with more legal permanent residents being detained and facing deportation.
About 27,000 warrants of removal were added to a federal database last month, according to Callahan’s memo. It’s unclear how many of those are for New Jersey residents.
Callahan warned that troopers are not to arrest people for outstanding administrative warrants and to “pay particular attention” to the wording of the warrant to ensure they adhere to the Immigrant Trust Directive.
Since 2018, the Immigrant Trust Directive has limited the information New Jersey police officers can share with federal civil immigration agents. The directive also prevents officers from detaining people based on suspected or actual immigration status and from questioning someone’s status unless relevant to a criminal investigation.
While critics have said the directive amounts to New Jersey providing “sanctuary” status to undocumented immigrants, the directive does not prevent authorities from helping immigration agents detain suspected criminals.
Attorney General Matthew Platkin said the 2018 directive ensures that cops spend their time tackling public safety issues while ensuring victims of and witnesses to crimes feel free to speak to police regardless of their immigration status. He added the directive was drafted in cooperation with chiefs of police and county prosecutors.
“Under the Immigrant Trust Directive, state and local law enforcement have and will continue to work with federal authorities to remove violent criminals from this country. Plain and simple, there is no ‘sanctuary’ for criminals in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.
Activists have been pushing New Jersey lawmakers to pass the Immigrant Trust Act, which would codify the directive and other protections for undocumented immigrants. The bill would require the attorney general to develop policies on so-called sensitive locations like health care facilities and public schools where assisting immigration authorities would be barred.
The bill has not yet been heard by a legislative committee, and leadership has not commented on plans to advance it.
The Trump administration has announced plans to open a new immigration detention facility in Newark this summer, which the city is fighting in court.

Ned Lamont’s nominees to serve as utilities regulators, despite some bipartisan concerns that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority has not done enough to ease voters’ frustrations with the cost of their electric bills.
Marissa Gillett, the chair of the PURA, cleared the chamber on a vote of 91 to 52, which saw seven Democrats join nearly all of the Republicans in opposing her nomination to another four-year term on the authority.
Her fellow commissioner, David Arconti, enjoyed more bipartisan support from his former colleagues in the House, who voted 136 to 9 in favor of his nomination.
“David Arconti and Marissa Gillett have an incredible amount of knowledge and experience on energy policy and are the kind of qualified candidates we need serving on behalf of the state and its ratepayers,” Lamont said in a statement following the vote. “Each nominee has a record of fairness, collaboration, and accountability, and will put consumers first in their decision making and leadership.”
Both nominations now head to the Senate, where they will likely face a final vote in the confirmation process next week.

While there was little doubt headed into Wednesday that either nominee had the support needed to advance out of the Democratic-controlled chamber, Republicans had threatened to take several hours to express their frustrations with Gillett’s leadership, including her tense relationship with the utilities and the cost of electricity.
That debate ended up kicking off later than expected, around 1:30 p.m., and lasted about two hours before the final vote. 
“The last four years, in my opinion, have been a catastrophe for the residents of Connecticut,” said state Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland. “I really, really, really challenge anybody here to to tell me that I’m wrong if you know a single person in your district that is happy with their bill.” 
Both Gillett and Arconti thanked members of the House for their support following Wednesday’s vote. 
“I have appreciated the opportunity to discuss my record and qualifications and look forward to continuing the great work of PURA alongside my colleagues and staff,” Gillett’s said in an emailed statement. 
Arconti, a former state representative from Danbury who also briefly served as a lobbyist for United Illuminating, also issued a statement upon his nomination advancing. He has served as an interim commissioner since August. 
“I am looking forward to working with my fellow Commissioners, PURA staff, the General Assembly and any stakeholder who is willing to come to the table to work towards a better Connecticut,” Arconti said in the statement.
Gillett, who first joined PURA in 2019, has faced a turbulent confirmation process since being tapped by Lamont for another term in January.
That same month, she was sued by the state’s two largest utilities — Eversource and United Illuminating — who accused her of usurping the power of fellow commissioners in hundreds of decisions that were handed down by the authority in recent years. Gillett denied the utilities’ characterization of the process, and Attorney General William Tong has sought to dismiss the suit. 
Among her opponents in the legislature, she has been accused of both taking an overly adversarial approach to dealing with the utilities and not doing enough to tamp down on the costs that are passed on to their customers through water, gas and electric rates. 
Speaking to reporters prior to the vote, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed exasperation with the process and publicity surrounding Gillett’s nomination, even as he defended some of her methods. 
“To people who really do not like Commissioner Gillett — and she has her detractors, both in this chamber and outside the chamber — my only response is, I think it’s good to have someone who challenges and questions,” Ritter said. “But the board probably needs to be reset and needs to stay out of the newspaper and stay out of this building and do their jobs.”
In order to ease her pathway through the legislature, Lamont’s office announced a deal in February to appoint to two new members to fill vacancies on PURA’s board — state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, and former state Rep. Holly Cheeseman, R- East Lyme — while also removing the authority from the executive branch and making it a quasi-public agency. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said Wednesday that while he recommended Cheeseman’s name to Lamont, he was not involved in negotiations over the deal that has since been widely panned by Republicans. 
Fonfara later drew scrutiny over his ownership of an energy business that had been repeatedly fined by PURA, prompting his attorney to issue a public letter last month accusing the authority and Gillett of retaliating against the senator for criticism of a bill that would have enhanced the power of the PURA’s chair during the 2023 legislative session.

A fellow Hartford Democrat in the House, state Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, in turn sent her own letter to her colleagues ahead of Wednesday’s vote accusing Gillett — who she erroneously called “Melissa” — of lacking transparency and putting her own interests ahead of ratepayers.
Gonzalez was one of seven Democrats to vote against Gillett’s nomination. After the vote, she told a reporter that her opposition had nothing to do with her friendship with Fonfara.
“Whatever is going on with [Fonfara] is private, I’m concerned about the consumer,” Gonzalez said. 
The only Republican to vote in favor of Gillett’s nomination was Rep. Bill Buckbee, R-New Milford. 
“I think she’s done a better job than she gets a lot of credit for in this building,” Buckbee said during the debate. “Nobody gives her the credit she deserves for what she’s done there.”
In addition to her four-year term as a regular member of the commission, Gillett’s two-year term as chair of PURA is scheduled to expire in July. Lamont has not said whether he plans to reappoint her to that role.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0409_SR_GillettNomination_043-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, re-introduced his bill Wednesday to eliminate the federal Department of Education and move “all critical federal programs” to other departments. 
Rounds introduced similar legislation in November, during the prior session of Congress.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to dismantle her department and “return education authority to the states.” The move followed a 50% reduction in department staff.
Trump signs order directing Education secretary to shut down her own department

Ultimately, only Congress — which established the 46-year-old department — has the authority to eliminate it.
Rounds sent a press release saying his legislation would not cut any education funding. He said some funds would flow to states as block grants while other programs would be funded through other federal agencies. He said eliminating the department’s “bureaucracy” would save the federal government approximately $2.2 billion annually.
“We all know that teachers, parents, local school boards and state Departments of Education know what’s best for their students, not bureaucrats in Washington,” Rounds said in the release.
Additionally, under Rounds’ legislation:

Schools would no longer be required to administer standardized assessments or track performance for identifying struggling schools, which Rounds said would allow “for more flexibility in assessment and school improvement strategies.”
Schools would no longer have to “comply with complex Title I funding regulations” (Title I funding supports schools with high numbers of low-income students), or “maintenance of effort standards or provide equitable services for private school students,” according to Rounds, who said that would “simplify financial management.”
“Schools would have more autonomy to set teacher certification standards and professional development plans, reducing federal oversight and allowing for tailored approaches to educator qualifications,” Rounds said.

Earlier this year, when Trump moved to dismantle the federal department, some public education advocates in South Dakota reacted negatively.
“If you close down the Department of Education without a plan for ensuring that programs like Title I and special education services continue, then what happens to the students who depend on them?” said Sandra Waltman, director of public affairs for the South Dakota Education Association.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)On April 3, Xiaotian Liu was continuing research for his computer science doctorate at Dartmouth College. On April 4, he was informed by the college that he needed to stop.
The college had run a check on Xiaotian’s F-1 student immigration status and discovered something unusual: Without warning, his status had been revoked. Without the status, Xiaotian could not continue with his work. 
Five days later, that decision has been halted, temporarily, after a federal judge in New Hampshire said Wednesday she would block the Trump administration’s apparent revocation of the status. 
But it remains unclear why the student’s immigration status was revoked in the first place — and whether the change in status was intentional or accidental.
Xiaotian sued the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block that change, arguing it had deprived him of due process rights by not informing him of the change or allowing him to respond. After a hearing Wednesday morning, Judge Samantha Elliott said she would issue a temporary restraining order against the department, which would reverse the change in status for two weeks. 
The same court will hold a hearing in the next two weeks on a much more extensive motion for a preliminary injunction against the status change. 
Xiaotian is one of two Dartmouth students to see their immigration status changed last week — and one of nearly 300 students across the country in recent days, according to the New York Times. 
The F-1 status is given to international students to allow them to complete their studies at an American college or university. It is different from an entry visa; there is currently no indication that Xiaotian’s visa has been revoked.
Representatives of the Department of Homeland Security did not inform Xiaotian that his immigration status had been changed, according to his attorneys. He learned of the change on Friday, after the college informed him of it after reviewing its records, they said. 
The doctoral student is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and Ronald Abramson of Shaheen & Gordon. 
Because Xiaotian has lost his status, he has had to pause his Ph.D. research and is no longer receiving compensation for his work, his attorneys said in court Wednesday. He is also fearful of being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as other students have been, his attorneys said. 
On March 25, a video of a Tufts student, Rumeysa Ozturk, being detained on the street in Somerville, Mass., by ICE officers sparked alarm among immigration advocates and students, and fueled protests. 
A lawyer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Raphael Katz, argued the court should not issue the restraining order because Xiaotian had not established that he would suffer “immediate and irreparable harm” if the court did nothing. Katz said Xiaotian could continue attending classes at Dartmouth College, even if he can’t continue his research. And he said Xiaotian could transfer his credits to a university outside of the U.S. if he wanted.
Katz said he could not provide the court information about why Xiaotian’s status was changed or confirm whether Xiaotian’s status was even changed. He said he was still awaiting information from the Department of Homeland Security. 
“I don’t have the facts to establish why the change in status happened,” he said in court.
“At this point, can you tell me whether this was intentional or a mistake?” Elliott asked. Katz said he could not. 
And Katz declined to tell the court whether there was a risk that Xiaotian might be detained. 
“Unfortunately, the government can’t make any representation on its enforcement priorities,” he said. 
Elliott said that plaintiffs had sufficiently shown that there is irreparable harm. 
“He’s not getting paid; he’s not working toward his Ph.D.,” she said.
In making their case, attorneys for Xiaotian stressed the unusual nature of the government’s action. Typically, colleges and universities will monitor their own international students and recommend to the federal department if a student’s F-1 status should be revoked. That arrangement — where schools police their own students — has been the case under the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, which was created in 2003 in response to the September 11 attacks.

“What typically happens is that the status change is at the initiative of the university, because the university becomes aware of the fact, for example, that a student is no longer in school, (or) the student has dropped out,” said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, at a press conference after the hearing. “This reverse situation is what’s incredibly novel and unique, and it’s one of the reasons why there’s not a lot of legal authority out here on this with respect to case law.” 
In Xiaotian’s case, DHS has provided no explanation for the halt. In court, Kim noted he had no criminal record. 
“The plaintiff hasn’t committed any crime,” said SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire. “Not even a parking ticket. He doesn’t even own a car.” 
It is not immediately clear when the hearing for Xiaotian’s preliminary injunction motion will take place, but attorneys said they expected it within the next week. 
Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security are expected to show up at that hearing to make the government’s case, Katz said. 
The New Hampshire lawsuit is one of several waged across the country by students who also had their F-1 status abruptly terminated. Two students at two different colleges in California are suing the department. And one student in Pennsylvania has initiated a class-action lawsuit, seeking to represent all people whose F-1 status has been revoked because of criminal charges that do not interfere with students’ “normal progress toward completion of a course of study.” 
At the press conference, Bissonnette did not comment on whether the ACLU has been in contact with the second Dartmouth student whose F-1 status was reportedly revoked. 
But he said that regardless of Elliott’s ruling, each affected student will likely need to sue the government independently in order to reverse the status change. But he said a favorable district court ruling could set a precedent that others could follow.
And Abramson noted the revocation of the F-1 status came despite no apparent criminal violation. 
“The presidential campaign and the messaging coming out of the administration has been that we’re going to focus on serious criminals and that that’s the problem with immigration in this country,” said Abramson. “This sort of process, and the fact that we have to expend nonprofit resources, private resources, government resources to respond to this situation flies in the face of that and makes us have to question if that’s really the motivation here at all.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NH-Federal-Courthouse-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Lawyers for immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was detained by federal authorities last month, allege in a new court filing that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra in response to her constitutionally protected speech and protest.
They filed an amended habeas corpus petition in U.S. District Court of Colorado on Wednesday challenging Vizguerra’s detention. They argue that ICE targeted Vizguerra, who also goes by Vizguerra-Ramirez, because of her national prominence and critiques of the Trump administration’s policies and tactics.
“There are strong indications that ICE’s enforcement actions against Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez were driven, to a large degree, by a desire for retaliation due to her prominence as a critic of Trump immigration policies, and to send a message to other potential critics,” lawyer Laura Lichter wrote.

Lichter requested an opportunity to amend the petition, which was first filed immediately following Vizguerra’s arrest, during a status conference last month. The federal government has 21 days to respond, and a hearing will likely then be scheduled. In the meantime, Vizguerra, a 53-year-old Denver resident whose home country is Mexico, will remain in custody at a private ICE facility in Aurora, as Judge Nina Wang has precluded immigration authorities from deporting her until she gets a hearing over her detention.
We got you
The amended petition contends that when she was placed in shackles and photographed during her arrest, an ICE officer said, “We finally got you.”
“The reason ICE was glad they finally ‘got’ Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez appears to be tied to her long history as an immigration and labor activist,” Lichter wrote.
The Denver ICE office posted that photo of Vizguerra in handcuffs and a belly chain on its X account. A few days later, the main ICE account amplified the post and wrote that “Despite her being featured in national media for years, we arrested her in public March 17. A high-profile status does not exempt a person from immigration law.” The petition notes that it was unique for ICE to highlight Vizguerra’s activism and national prominence in their post when compared to the hundreds of other posts announcing immigration arrests.
Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, posted on X on March 19 that ICE will arrest “illegal aliens regardless of if they were a featured ‘Time Person of the Year.'” Vizguerra was named one of the 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2017 after she took sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration.
The petition also notes posts from former ICE Denver field director John Fabbricatore that celebrated Vizguerra’s arrest and displayed screenshots of Vizguerra’s Facebook posts that were critical of Trump.
Targeting Vizguerra for detention because of her activism violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, Lichter argued.
“The way Respondents publicly celebrated their apprehension of Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez, and substantially compromised her ability to have a fair hearing on her claim for persecution-based protections, is likely to chill the speech of other immigrants opposed to the government’s immigration policies and practices,” the petition reads.
The amended petition also includes details about repeated attempts from immigration authorities to conduct a so-called “reasonable fear interview” with Vizguerra without her lawyer present. Those interviews happen during immigration proceedings to determine if a removal would cause harm to the immigrant.
The petition alleges that authorities tried to interview Vizguerra four times between March 18 and March 27 without giving advance notice to her lawyer. They gave notice and tried again on March 31, even though Lichter requested that any interview happen after pending litigation or not until she could be physically present with Vizguerra. Lichter has not heard back from ICE over her concerns.
“These actions — taken while Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez remains in ICE custody and under ongoing judicial protection — reflect a broader strategy to bypass meaningful review despite unresolved jurisdictional and constitutional claims. They constitute retaliation,” the petition reads.
Detention of critics
Vizguerra has lived in the United States since 1997. She was arrested in 2009 for having a fake ID and driving without insurance and was placed in removal proceedings. An immigration judge offered her the option of voluntary departure in 2011, which Vizguerra appealed. She then left the country in 2012 to see her dying mother in Mexico and reentered the United States without authorization in 2013. She was sentenced to ICE supervision and has been granted multiple stays of removal since then, the last of which expired last year.
The federal government argues that her order of removal was reinstated in 2013 when she came back to the United States and is still valid. Her lawyers contend, however, that ICE officials issued that order improperly, without letting her know about its existence and letting her raise an objection to it before it was signed.
“The procedural error was not immaterial. Had Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez been notified of the possibility of a reinstatement order, she could have alerted officials to the fact that she did not have a prior removal order. Instead, she had a grant of voluntary departure that was issued in lieu of a removal order, and by leaving the U.S. while her appeal was pending, she necessarily complied with the order’s departure deadline and did not leave under an order of removal. Absent a prior removal order, there was nothing to be reinstated in 2013,” the petition reads.
Vizguerra’s case comes amid detentions of other immigrants who have protested or criticized the government, including former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill that would require children to be toilet trained before entering pre-K has failed in a House vote.
The House Common Education Committee struck down Senate Bill 382 by vote of 8-3 on Wednesday.
The bill would have permitted public schools to temporarily withdraw a student after three or more soiling incidents until the child is toilet trained. Schools also could connect families with toilet training resources. 
Students with disabilities would have been exempt from the rule.
The legislation from Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, and Rep. Marilyn Stark, R-Bethany, passed almost unanimously through the full Senate. Bullard said a lack of toilet training puts “an undue burden on the schools.”
But, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers opposed it on Wednesday. The committee panned the bill without discussion nor debate.
Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, said after the meeting that the bill could impact children who haven’t yet been recognized as having a disability. Some children aren’t identified for disability assistance until after they are enrolled in school, she said.
Toileting resistance is more common among young children who have autism or developmental delays, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“That bill wasn’t going to help the kids that need it most,” Pogemiller said.
Also on Wednesday, the committee advanced a bill with an 8-3 vote that would ban students from using cellphones in public schools for a year. Senate Bill 139 would allow districts to decide whether to keep the cellphone ban in place after the 2025-26 school year.
A similar bill that originated in the House passed through the Senate Education Committee the day before. House Bill 1276 would require districts to implement a policy restricting cellphone use during the school day, but it would allow local school boards to opt out and continue permitting cellphones if they wish.
Lawmakers from both chambers now will have to negotiate which bill language they prefer to send to the governor’s desk.

Free.,Two federal judges block Trump administration deportations under Alien Enemies Act,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/two-federal-judges-block-trump-administration-deportations-under-alien-enemies-act,,"WASHINGTON — Federal judges in Texas and New York Wednesday temporarily halted the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in parts of those two states where Venezuelans set for deportation are incarcerated.The American Civil Liberties Union filed cases in the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Texas, after the U.S. Supreme Court this week deemed challenges to the wartime law must be brought in the location of those subject to President Donald Trump’s proclamation on use of the act. The cases earlier were argued in the District of Columbia.That Monday decision from the high court lifted a lower court’s order that barred the Trump administration from invoking the wartime law to deport any Venezuelan nationals 14 or older who are suspected gang members — but the justices also said unanimously that the Venezuelans must be allowed court hearings.Texas Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the deportation of Venezuelans in the entire state of Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, as well as the facility where the three men who brought the case are currently detained, the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville.The restraining order from Rodriguez Jr. is in place until April 23. The order also states that the three Venezuelan men cannot be removed from the El Valle Detention Center, which is the same center from which the Trump administration on March 15 transferred those subject to the wartime law and placed them on a plane to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.New York orderThe temporary restraining order from New York Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein that he plans to sign Wednesday would cover Venezuelans in the Southern District of New York, according to The Associated Press. That would include New York City, the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx and Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Westchester counties.  Two Venezuelans brought the suit in the Southern District of New York.Hellerstein, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, will hold an April 22 hearing to determine if the temporary restraining order should become a preliminary injunction. The ACLU is also pushing for a class certification.The Supreme Court said this week it will allow, for now, the Trump administration to use the Alien Enemies Act, but those subject to the proclamation must be allowed to bring a challenge in court.The original suit against the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act came from five men detained in Texas. The justices argued that the proper court venue should be where they were being detained in Texas rather than before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. More than 238 Venezuelans have been deported to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT.Marylander's case citedJudge Rodriguez Jr., whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2017, in placing the temporary restraining order noted that anyone who is erroneously deported under the Alien Enemies Act potentially cannot be returned to the United States.In his reasoning, he cited the Trump administration’s stance in a high-profile case that led to a Maryland man being sent to a prison in El Salvador by mistake.The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to strike down a lower court’s order that officials return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia of Beltsville, Maryland, who had a 2019 court order barring his removal to El Salvador. On Monday the Supreme Court temporarily paused the deadline until the high court could make a full decision.“Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the Proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States,” Rodriguez Jr. wrote.A hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in the Brownsville division, is set for Friday 1:30 p.m. Central. Rodriguez said of the upcoming Friday hearing, “the Court will consider whether to extend the temporary restraining order or issue other forms of emergency relief.”",,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

James Tipton speaks to students after chairing a Mach 4 meeting of the House Committee on Postsecondary Education that became the subject of an open meetings challenge. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)
Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office has ruled that a House committee violated the state open meetings law but the attorney general does not have the authority to determine if the committee also violated legislative procedures. 
The opinion is a response to an open meetings complaint filed by James Orlick, a graduate student at the University of Louisville, who opposed a bill ending diversity, equity and inclusion in Kentucky higher education. Orlick, who presented his complaint to House Speaker David Osborne and committee chair Rep. James Tipton, questioned the legality of a vote on a title amendment to House Bill 4.
At the end of a contentious committee meeting on March 4, Tipton, a Taylorsville Republican, adjourned the House Committee on Postsecondary Education before it had taken the necessary procedural step of approving a title amendment to the measure. Tipton called for the dispersing lawmakers to vote on the title amendment, which they did. Title amendments are required to ensure the title of a bill approved by a committee accurately reflects the contents of the legislation.
The attorney general’s opinion released Wednesday said the committee violated the open meetings law by not responding to Orlick’s complaint within three business days as required by state law. Orlick took the issue to the attorney general’s office after not receiving a response. 
“In this appeal, the Appellant (Orlick) asks the Office to determine whether the Committee may reconvene a meeting — immediately after the chairman announced the meeting was adjourned — to complete the Committee’s business it inadvertently had not finished,” the opinion said. “Thus, in effect, the Appellant asks the Office to determine the legality of the procedures used by a standing committee of the General Assembly. This the Office cannot do.” 
The opinion also says that if the Attorney General did have jurisdiction over the matter, its ruling would be moot as the title amendment was later added during the legislative process. The Senate added the title amendment when it debated the bill. 
The General Assembly ultimately put HB 4 into law after overriding a veto from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Attorney general opinions do carry the weight of law and can be appealed to the appropriate circuit court. Orlick told the Kentucky Lantern Wednesday afternoon that he was considering other legal options. 
Orlick said he feels “some relief” that the opinion noted the legislature violated the open meetings law, but was concerned about the office’s opinion that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter. 
“I think this is a very interesting and concerning issue that now the attorney general is saying that (he) doesn’t have jurisdiction,” he said. “So who’s going to hold them accountable? Just trust the Kentucky legislature to police themselves and they violate laws? I think this is a dangerous and a slippery slope for any kind of democracy, even on the state level, too.” 
Laura Leigh Goins, a spokesperson for the House Republican Caucus, said in a statement “the committee failed to adopt a title amendment, but afterward recognized that its attempt to fix the oversight did not comply with its rules.” Thus, the Senate added the title amendment, which was adopted by both chambers, “ensuring that it was done in compliance with the legislative rules and the Open Meetings Act.” 
“Ultimately, as the opinion recognizes, the issue was identified early by lawmakers and staff and addressed immediately with an appropriate remedy,” she said. “The Speaker’s Office is taking additional steps to ensure members, particularly committee chairs and vice chairs, avoid similar situations in the future.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3368-1024x667.jpeg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

People visiting the gulf beach at Grand Isle State Park endorsed the switch. (Photo by Julie O’Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Florida Senate passed two bills on Wednesday that replace all references in state statutes to the Gulf of Mexico with the “Gulf of America,” and those measures will now soon go to the governor’s office for his likely signature.
That’s despite the fact that public opinion polls consistently show that the name change isn’t popular with the public.
One measure (SB 1058), sponsored by Sarasota Republican Joe Gruters, requires state agencies to update geographical materials to reflect the new federal designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” Public school and charter school instructional materials and library center collections adopted or acquired on or after July 1 of this year must reflect the new federal designation.
The other proposal (HB 575) calls for all state and local references to the Gulf of Mexico to be changed to the “Gulf of America,” and was sponsored in the Senate by Pinellas County Republican Nick DiCeglie.
While Pinellas County Democrat Darryl Rouson make a joking reference when he asked whether DiCeglie would consider renaming the measure the “Gulf of Americas” that would include North America, South America, Central America, and actress America Ferrera, South Florida Democrat Lori Berman didn’t think it was a laughing matter at all.
She called the legislation a “waste of time,” saying that it “would not improve the lives of our constituents, nor will it advance our state’s economic, educational, or environmental policies.”
“We are spending taxpayer dollars and legislative time on a symbolic gesture, and offers no tangible benefits,” she said. “We are prioritizing a superficial display of nationalism over the pressing needs of the district we represent.”
DiCeglie responded by calling it a “patriotic bill,” and a nod to American exceptionalism.
The passage of these two bills follow President Donald Trump’s an executive order  in February replacing all federal references to the “Gulf of Mexico” with the “Gulf of America.”
A Fox News survey of nearly 1,000 voters conducted last month showed that 67% opposed renaming the body of water located on the southeastern periphery of the North American continent. Other polls similarly show that the name change isn’t popular.
A majority of Florida respondents — 58% — said that they also oppose the idea strongly or somewhat, and only 31% expressed support for the renaming, according to a public opinion survey of 871 registered voters from the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab conducted in February.
DeSantis began using the term “Gulf of America” going back to an executive order he signed back in January.

(Photo courtesy of New Jersey Senate)New Jersey’s top environmental official alleged Wednesday that opponents of proposed rules meant to address rising flood risks along New Jersey’s coast have repeatedly lied in an effort to spur worry among local officials in hopes of waylaying the changes.
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette told the Assembly Budget Committee that opposition to what’s known as the resilient environments and landscapes rule proposal is driven by a coordinated misinformation campaign.
“It’s not that they’re misinterpreting,” LaTourette said of local officials opposed to the rules. “It’s that there was a very deliberate campaign that constructed a narrative, sent that narrative to every local elected official because they knew if they got the elected officials scared and could sow distrust of the DEP — your floodplain manager who wants to help people — they knew they would then get to you.”
The 1,044-page rules proposal in question would set higher elevation requirements for new construction, update standards for certain infrastructure and new residential buildings in areas that stand to be affected by rising sea levels, and update recordkeeping of certain permits, among numerous other changes. State officials are expected to decide whether to move forward with the changes by the end of the summer.
Opponents ranging from business and construction trade groups to local and county officials allege the rules proposal would entirely prohibit the construction of affordable housing in some Jersey Shore communities, limit residents’ ability to improve their properties, and spike development costs in regulated areas.
Ray Cantor, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, is one of the critics of the proposed changes.
“To hear Commissioner LaTourette tell it today, this 1,000-page-plus rule is much ado about nothing. We find that’s irresponsible,” Cantor said in a statement. “While he continues to dismiss these concerns, we will continue to amplify why they represent the next major affordability shoe to drop in New Jersey if these rules are finalized as proposed.”
The rules would require new buildings in inundation risk zones — areas that would be at risk of permanent or daily flooding as a result of sea level rise over the next 75 years — to be elevated 5 feet (or, as LaTourette put it Wednesday, “plus-five”).
LaTourette, who acknowledged his frustration during exchanges with lawmakers at Wednesday’s hearing, said opponents have overstated the impact of the proposed elevation requirements because numerous municipalities enacted elevation rules stricter than those required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.
“The local governments who know their communities best didn’t think the FEMA standards were enough then, and so some communities have a plus-two or a plus-three. The plus-five is not on top of that, so in most coastal communities, we’re talking about two or three [feet],” he said.
Some lawmakers questioned whether local officials’ opposition to the rule changes is the result of being hoodwinked by misinformation.
“Respectfully, commissioner, municipalities who have dealt in these areas for hundreds of years, they’re not so easily duped by some special interest with nefarious intentions. They live and breathe this,” said Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger (R-Monmouth).
The state proposal would also eliminate permits-by-rule and replace them with permits-by-registration in most cases and with permits-by-certification in others.
The change would be purely for bookkeeping reasons, LaTourette said. Previously, property improvements made under a permit-by-rule were recorded nowhere and could be used as a basis to deny flood insurance payouts, he said.
Like other department heads, LaTourette warned of uncertainty surrounding federal funding amid the Trump administration’s efforts to curtail spending.
The Department of Environmental Protection anticipates it will spend roughly $1.1 billion in federal dollars for the fiscal year that begins July 1, and the commissioner warned a reduction of that funding could imperil flood insurance, water infrastructure, and beach replenishments where the federal government covers 75% of costs.
The nature of the department’s work, LaTourette said, means money lost because of federal cuts would likely have to be reclaimed through tax hikes, whether at the state or local level.
“We can’t not make those improvements. People’s health and the ability to flush our toilets is on the line,” LaTourette said. “So, what would happen? Raising rates on New Jerseyans, that’s what would happen. It’s the only thing that would happen because we can’t not have clean, flowing water and toilets that flush.”

Pat Pettey of Kansas City lauds signing of bill helpful to equipping law enforcement officers with medication to treat fentanyl overdoses.,"Kansas City Democratic Sen. Pat Pettey, left, praised signing by Gov. Laura Kelly of bill helpful to equipping law enforcement officers with medication to treat fentanyl overdoses. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill unanimously approved by the Kansas Legislature repealing a statute inhibiting the ability of law enforcement to obtain emergency medication to reverse the effect of opioid overdoses.
The Democratic governor said Senate substitute for Senate Bill 193 would benefit Kansans by doing away with a mandate law enforcement agencies employ a medical director or licensed pharmacist when dealing with naloxone, also known as Narcan, that could be administered to people suffering fentanyl poisoning.
The cost of complying with state protocol set in 2017, along with the ongoing health-care workforce shortage, inhibited smaller law enforcement agencies that wanted to outfit personnel with doses of naloxone. Under the new law, lifesaving medication would be available to law enforcement as an over-the-counter item.
“We know that addiction does not discriminate,” Kelly said. “I’m proud to sign this bipartisan bill into law so that communities of all sizes can implement this commonsense policy and prevent Kansans from feeling the devastating impacts of fatal overdoses.”
In 2023, the Legis­lature approved a bill signed by Kelly that legalized fentanyl test strips to help Kansans avoid opioid overdoses. Kelly signed good-Samaritan legislation last year to extend protection to individuals providing aid during a drug-use medical emergency.
The number of overdose deaths in Kansas resulting from opioids, including fentanyl, dropped 17% from 497 fatalities in 2022 to 414 in 2023.
The bill signed by Kelly was introduced by former Topeka police chief Ed Klumpp on behalf of the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police, Kansas Peace Officers Association and Kansas Sheriffs Association.
Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said the bipartisan legislation “breaks down roadblocks” so officers were more likely to be equipped with naloxone.
The reform should have an immediate impact on overdose survival because seconds mean the difference between life and death, said Sen. William Clifford, a Garden City Republican and former emergency medical technician.
“The opioid epidemic has cost thousands of our fellow Kansans their lives. This commonsense fix will empower our first responders throughout our state to save lives,” he said.
 
Newborn screening
On Wednesday, Kelly also signed House substitute for Senate Bill 126 to establish a universal newborn screen program administered by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. With parental consent, Kansas screens newborns for 36 of 38 treatable conditions at no cost. A KDHE representative said there were plans to add the two additional conditions to the screening protocol.
The bill also raised the minimum state financial aid to local health departments from $7,000 per year to $12,000 per year.
Rep. Brett Fairchild, R-St. John, was the only member of the Legislature to vote against the bill because he objected to a provision increasing the annual assessment on certain hospitals.
“Even though this is a tax that the hospitals impose on themselves, I still view this as technically being a tax increase. When I ran for office, I pledged that I would never vote in favor of a tax increase,” he said.
Kelly also signed Senate Bill 199 to authorize sale of fireworks throughout the year and establish procedures for retailers to engage in permanent rather than seasonal sales. She placed into law House Bill 2280 to make certain any person declared a veteran by an act of Congress was likewise considered a veteran under Kansas law.
She put a signature to Senate Bill 44, which declared antisemitism contrary to public policy of Kansas. In March, House Republicans blocked an attempt by Democratic Rep. Valdenia Winn of Kansas City to amend the bill to condemn all forms of racism and discrimination.
Under House Bill 2313, Kelly’s signature meant state computer systems couldn’t use artificial intelligence platforms controlled by countries considered foreign adversaries of the United States. In addition, the bill banned medical or research facilities from using genetic technology produced by foreign adversaries.
Senate Bill 50 signed by Kelly created uniform interest rates for college scholarships attached to a post-graduation service requirements. She signed Senate Bill 42 to create for law enforcement a real-time online insurance verification system for motor vehicles.
Kelly endorsed House Bill 2342 to permit the Kansas Department of Commerce and Kansas Department of Labor to initiate criminal history background checks when reviewing final applicants for sensitive positions at those agencies.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3050439-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

Legal experts say his claims about the laws being unconstitutional are an overreach.","In summary
Trump ordered his attorney general to move against state climate programs that clash with his energy agenda. Legal experts say his claims about the laws being unconstitutional are an overreach.


President Donald Trump has issued an order that takes aim at state and local climate change laws and policies, including California’s landmark market program for reducing greenhouse gases.
Trump’s executive order directs U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify state and local acts that may be unconstitutional or preempted by federal law. Within 60 days, the attorney general must report back to the president with findings and recommendations for action.
Trump’s order singles out California’s cap and trade program, a market-based system created in 2012 that is considered one of the state’s key policies for combating climate change. The program sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell credits. Twelve other states have similar trade programs for cutting greenhouse gases.
“California, for example, punishes carbon use by adopting impossible caps on the amount of carbon businesses may use, all but forcing businesses to pay large sums to ‘trade’ carbon credits to meet California’s radical requirements,” Trump’s order says.
The order comes as the Trump administration moves to boost domestic oil and gas production while sidelining efforts to develop wind and solar. 
Trump’s order says states have mounted “illegitimate impediments” to domestic energy production for oil, natural gas, nuclear power and other energy sources. Notably, the order derisively placed the term “climate change” in quotation marks.
Some legal experts called the order an overreach, disputing  the president’s claims that states are exceeding their authority or that their climate programs are unconstitutional.
“The implication that the attorney general can just go out and declare this state law is unconstitutional and that therefore it’s no longer a valid law — that is the big problem with this,” said Margaret A. Coulter, a senior climate attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s more of an intimidation tactic.”
Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said the Constitution’s 10th Amendment grants states the authority to set their own rules in areas where the federal government has not acted. “In other words, the federal government cannot simply grab powers because it wants to; doing so would in no uncertain terms represent a constitutional crisis,” Turner wrote. 
Still, they say the order could have an overarching effect on the states. Turner wrote that Trump’s order “does not directly challenge, prohibit, argue preempted, or enjoin any state or local law. But it is likely a forerunner to litigation, lawmaking, or the withholding of federal funds.” This, she wrote, will have “a significant chilling effect on local climate policy innovation.”
California Attorney General Rob Bonta did not immediately return CalMatters’ calls seeking reaction to the Trump order.
The first Trump administration sued the state of California challenging its cap-and-trade program, which is linked to a program in Canada, on the grounds that the state was entering into an international treaty. Trump lost that lawsuit, with the judge ruling that the administration failed to provide any evidence that cap and trade undermines the federal government’s ability to conduct foreign policy.  
Trump said state climate policies and laws “unduly discriminate” against fossil fuel companies and “impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification,” which raises energy costs for Americans.
“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy. They should not stand,” it says. 
Trump also singled out laws in New York and Vermont that created climate funds requiring fossil fuel companies to contribute to a fund for climate adaptation. The goal is to cover the rising costs of extreme weather events.
In addition, the order targets civil actions against fossil fuel companies. California is leading efforts to make fossil fuel giants pay billions of dollars for the climate damage they have long denied.
Trump said these programs “extort” money from oil companies.
The oil industry has been pushing the Trump administration to take a more aggressive legal stance against these state climate accountability efforts. Industry groups are encouraging the Justice Department to either back their lawsuits or initiate federal challenges of its own against states like New York and Vermont, The Wall Street Journal has reported. 
California is considering similar legislation. A bill introduced by Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, would require companies to pay for the damage that greenhouse gas emissions have caused in California since 1990.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas companies, applauded the new order, saying it seeks to “hold states like New York and California accountable for pursuing unconstitutional efforts that illegally penalize U.S. oil and natural gas producers for delivering the energy American consumers rely on every day.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022124-Chevron-Richmond-LE-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee Wednesday approved a nearly $10 billion education budget for 2026 that increases funding in some areas and prepares for an attempt to overhaul how state schools get money.  
SB 112, the main budget bill sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would increase the education budget for the fiscal year 2026, which begins October 1, by $543.3 million, or 5.81%, to $9.89 billion.  
“We’re still in a good place with resources for our public educational institutions, be they universities, colleges, junior colleges, and K-12, Pre-K and other elements,” Orr said, though he added that they have “to be very mindful going forward” not only due to future economic uncertainty but also because of efforts to create a new funding formula.
The budget includes $9.6 million to fund a new parental leave law for state and education employees, as well as $15.6 million for an injury compensation program for education employees awaiting legislative approval. The budget also appropriates $2.5 million for a pilot project to provide teletherapy, or mental health counseling via phone or video, in schools and increased funding for prison education by $3.7 million, or a 19.3% increase, for a total of $22.8 million.

“We know that there’s a lot of mental health challenges in our schools today. Well, there are companies that do via video telecounseling, and because it’s so hard, as you heard in the committee, to find school counselors, this will be an assist,” Orr said.
The Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) would receive an increase of 31%, increasing it’s funding by $32.2 million under the Senate committee substitute. The Alabama Reading Initiative’sfunding would increase by 6.4% percent, a $9 million increase. Transportation funding would be increased by about 9.1%, or about $40 million. 
The state’s share that it pays for state and education employees is also increasing. PEEHIP would have to contribute $904 to each education employee’s health insurance premiums, up fron $800, while SEIB would have to contribute $1,025 to their state employee’s health insurance premiums. The Alabama Public Library Service would keep their funding level from the current fiscal year.
The budget does not include a $100 million supplemental appropriation to transition the state’s student funding formula to a hybrid model from the Education Opportunities Reserve Fund for the same fiscal year. SB 111, also sponsored by Orr, would appropriate $375 million over three years for that transition, which aims to get more money to students with particular needs, including children in poverty and English Language Learners. 
The committee also approved SB 113, sponsored by Orr, which appropriates an additional $524.3 million to schools in the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. That includes $100 million to local school boards for new school buses and $166 million to the State Department of Education for one-time expenses, such as college and career readiness grants and providing additional school safety training and services. 
Orr said that higher education institutions received additional funding in the supplemental to keep the current funding ratio between K-12 and higher education due to an increase from the student funding formula changes.
“Colleges and universities usually get around 25%, 27% of whatever the K-12 world gets, so they’re going to be getting additional resources in this budget because we remove $375 [million] from the savings account [and] put it towards K-12,” Orr said.
SB 114, also sponsored by Orr, is another supplemental appropriation bill that would allocate $1.25 billion from the Education Trust Fund Advancement and Technology Fund for the current fiscal year, ending September 30. That supplemental also includes about $908 million for the Department of Education to be distributed to local school boards and other education state entities, such as the Board of Trustees of the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind and the Board of Youth Services School Districts.
The committee also approved separate funding bills for Tuskegee University, totaling $15.8 million, Talladega College with $1.33 million, and Southern Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Camp Hill, totaling $450,000.
Orr said he expects the Senate to consider the funding bills Thursday.

Wilson ran for the Supreme Court last fall against now-Justice Judge Katherine Bidegaray, who replaced Dirk Sandefur on the bench. Wilson garnered 254,294 votes in the statewide race, but lost the election by about eight percentage points.
Now, Wilson will be seeking the seat currently held by Justice Beth Baker, who will not seek reelection. Wilson is the first candidate to announce for the Supreme Court race nearly 18 months ahead of the election.

“As a native Montanan and a conservative, I firmly believe Supreme Court Justices must apply the law and the constitution as written to all their rulings.  As your next Montana Supreme Court Justice, I pledge to follow that guiding conservative principle. I will not be beholden to any special interest group’s agenda, and recognize that the court’s role is to interpret the law as written – not create it,” Wilson said in a written statement.
Baker was elected to the Supreme Court in 2010, and won reelection to her seat in 2018. She confirmed to the Daily Montanan that she will not seek a third eight-year term.
“I think it’ll be time for some new energy,” Baker said. “I’ve still got almost two full years left, and I want to be able to give my full effort for the rest of my term. It is a tremendous honor to serve the Montana justice system.”
Wilson worked as a a prosecutor in Great Falls after graduating from law school in Minnesota and has served as a district court judge in Flathead County since 2017.
His campaign announcement highlighted a 2020 ruling he made striking down then-Gov. Steve Bullock’s mask mandate made during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 2026 election cycle will be the first following the Legislature’s passage of House Bill 39, which allows political parties to donate to judicial candidates.
During his 2024 campaign, Wilson was “strongly recommended” by the Flathead County Republican Central Committee, and received campaign contributions from the Stillwater Republican Central Committee, according to campaign finance reports.
He was also endorsed by the Montana Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed current Chief Justice Cory Swanson’s campaign. Swanson won his race by roughly eight percentage points.

Polk County Republican Sen. Colleen Burton has led the charge in attempting to place some restrictions on these intoxicating products, which have emerged since the state legalized hemp in 2019. Since then, some states have banned all such products, while others have heavily regulated them.
Burton said that people have asked her why is she trying to regulate an industry that has been established in Florida for years. She said hemp-derived THC products are “causing harm to Floridians.”
“We have retailers in the state of Florida that are selling products that are intoxicating,” she said. “They are selling products that are putting adults and children in the hospital. And, sadly, they are selling products that are causing the deaths of Floridians.”
She alluded to a Jacksonville television station’s website, which reported this week on a Georgia woman who  believes her 25-year-old son’s death from heart disease was caused by ingesting Delta-8 gummies. “That young man did not know that what he was ingesting was going to hurt him,” Burton said. 
The bill (SB 438) bans all Delta-8 products and limits the amount of Delta-9 hemp-derived products to no more than five milligrams per serving or 50 milligrams per container. It limits the amount of THC in hemp-infused drinks to five milligrams per container. Such drinks could only be sold through a retailer holding a liquor license.
It requires that each final batch of hemp extract must be tested in a certified marijuana testing laboratory before it may be sold in the state, with results verified and signed by two laboratory employees. The lab would determine whether the product meets the definition of hemp and hemp extract. 
During a combined Florida House workgroup formed to study the hemp industry earlier in the session, the owner of a Lakeland testing lab that contracted with the Florida Department of Agriculture to test cannabis and hemp products appeared. He testified that his lab tested 50 out of 53 flower hemp samples from different smoke/hemp shops across the state that were over the legal 0.3% Delta 9 THC limit, and found contaminants in these products.
“These are very intoxicating products,” said Southeast Florida Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell. “They’re addicting products at the end of the day. And people need to know that. … We need to make sure that people know what they’re buying. And we have seen so many fly-by-night places selling hemp — ‘safe hemp’ — and the THC levels are higher than the medical marijuana that you can get in a dispensary.”
The bill prohibits businesses and food establishments permitted to sell hemp products from advertising “in a manner” visible to  the public from any street, sidewalk, park, or other public place.
Children
Florida law already bans marketing THC-hemp in a way that might attract children. The bill expands that definition to include containers displaying toys or other features that target children and products manufactured in a form or packaged in a container that bears any “reasonable remembrance to a branded food product in a way that the product could mistaken for the branded food product, especially by children.”
And it says that all such products must be placed out of the reach of customers, either in a controlled area accessible only to employees or in a locked display case, excluding hemp-infused beverages.
A similar bill passed unanimously in the Florida Senate a year ago, but Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed it following heavy lobbying from the hemp industry. Grateful for the reprieve, several hemp entrepreneurs helped fund DeSantis’ campaign to bring down Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized the recreational use of cannabis for adults 21 and over.
Jacksonville Democrat Tracie Davis, who co-sponsored the bill, acknowledged in her closing statement that the bill wasn’t significantly different than last year’s version. “This was a bill that was vetoed,” she said. “There’s not that much that’s different from last year’s bill that was vetoed.”  
The vote in favor was unanimous.
The House version (HB 7027) is now sponsored by Panhandle Republican Rep. Michelle Salzman. It has two more committees to go through before reaching the floor of that chamber.

(Courtesy U.S. Centers for Disease Control)The Indiana Department of Health on Wednesday confirmed five additional cases of the highly infectious measles virus — less than 48 hours after announcing the state’s first laboratory-confirmed case this year in an unvaccinated Allen County minor.
Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak.
The newly reported cases include three more minors — also unvaccinated. The vaccination status of two infected adults is “unclear,” according to a news release.
“All six cases are connected to each other but at this time there are no known links to outbreaks in other states,” the department continued.
“State and local public health officials are working together on the investigation to contact those with known exposure to help prevent further spread of infection,” the news release added. It said the risk to the general public “remains low.”

Thomas Duszynski, an epidemiology expert at Indiana University Indianapolis’ School of Public Health, said the risk is “low, but it’s not zero.”
“Measles is one of the most infectious organisms on the planet,” he told the Capital Chronicle. A single person with measles passes the virus on to an average of 12-18 people.
If those involved in the outbreak are quarantining, the risk to fellow Hoosiers is lower, Duszynski said. But measles symptoms can also take up to 21 days to present, meaning that infected people can spread the virus before realizing they’re sick.
Symptoms typically include a fever, cough, white bumps inside the mouth and a rash that begins at the hairline and extends down the torso and limbs. The department encouraged Hoosiers experiencing symptoms to stay home and call their doctors “right away,” before going to the doctor’s office. Those with the virus should stay home and away from others.
The risk of severe disease is higher in those with immature or compromised immune systems: young children, pregnant women, the elderly and the sick.
“The current outbreak that’s going on in the U.S., 70-plus of the 600-plus cases have been hospitalized, and most of those are children under the age of five,” he said.
Duszynski warned that measles can also lead to life-threatening complications like pneumonia and brain swelling. Texas health officials have confirmed two measles deaths in unvaccinated school-aged children.
Because it’s a virus, he said, “There is no treatment for measles. There’s only supportive care.”
However, the measles vaccine is among the most effective around. IDOH said one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine provides 93% protection, and the full two-dose course provides 97% protection.

Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at 12-15 months old, and again at 4-6 years of age before they go to kindergarten. But children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at greater risk.
IDOH encouraged residents to check with their health providers and ensure they and their families are up to date with their vaccines.
Duszynski said people born before 1957 are considered immune “because measles was so common prior to that, that almost everybody got measles. And if you were lucky enough to survive, you have lifelong immunity.”
But those born 1957-1968 may want to consider a booster. A small percentage of the vaccines given over that time period were of the killed virus — less effective than the live virus vaccine typically used. Those with just one dose may also consider a second.
Duszynski noted that 95% of the population must be vaccinated to secure “herd immunity,” protecting people who cannot get the vaccine, like babies, pregnant women and people allergic to its ingredients.
He recommended that people hesitant to get the immunization talk to their doctors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid a nationwide wave of student visa cancellations, 18 University of Utah international students and recent graduates had their visas revoked and their records from a federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System terminated, many without notice. 
It’s a staggering number, if compared to other high-profile campuses, like Columbia University, which has been aggressively targeted by the Trump Administration for their big pro-Palestine protests, and has reported the termination of four student visas. 
The Utah revocations may have also come as a surprise to the U. students, since none of them were flagged for participating in protests, a University of Utah spokesperson said. The stated reasons, according to the University, “include ‘failure to maintain nonimmigrant status’ and/or criminal record check.”

Other public university students across the state have also been affected by the recent cancellations, The Salt Lake Tribune first reported. The Department of Homeland Security terminated the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records of five Weber State University students. SEVIS is a DHS program that contains and oversees the essential information of students with different types of student visas, in addition to other work programs for recent graduates. 
It’s still unclear whether the termination of those records means the visas are revoked, a Weber State University spokesperson said. 
The Utah System of Higher Education declined to comment on the students’ issues with their academic permits.
At Utah Tech, nine students had their I-20s canceled, a public information officer said. That’s a document issued by schools that certifies a student’s eligibility to study in the country. 
At Salt Lake Community College, three students had their visas revoked; at Snow College, two students were impacted; and three Utah Valley University students were also affected, spokespeople for the institutions said on Wednesday. While Utah State University students have been affected, the school declined to provide exact numbers to protect the students’ privacy.
What we know about the U. students
Most higher education institutions haven’t released much information on the circumstances surrounding the terminations, since cases are still recent and uncertain. 
However, Utah’s flagship university had some more details as of Wednesday morning. Approximately half of the students are from China, a spokesperson said in an email. The other half are from several countries including India and some Middle Eastern countries. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Similar actions from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State are routine, the spokesperson said. 
“Over the course of any school year, international students may have their visas revoked or SEVIS records terminated as the result of an arrest or being charged with criminal activity,” the spokesperson said. Those activities may include domestic violence allegations or driving under the influence.
Utah News Dispatch hasn’t been able to obtain additional details about the affected students. However, according to the Tribune, most of them don’t have criminal records while some have had received traffic infractions.
But, what’s new is that SEVIS records are being terminated without any notification to the university or students. Many institutions have noticed the cancellations in routine checks of the system to verify students’ status. 
“As a public institution of higher education, the University of Utah follows state and federal law. We are currently in a period of enhanced immigration enforcement,” the spokesperson said. “We are sharing guidance with our international students and scholars about the ways they can stay in good standing and maintain their visa status.”
In an email sent to international students, the U. advised to take proactive steps to preserve their visa status. 
“While there have been no changes to immigration laws at this time, it is important to note that modifications can occur with little notice,” the university’s International Students and Scholar Services office wrote. 
Other instructions also include avoiding nonessential international travel, maintaining full-time enrollment or, for recent graduates, employment; following all laws “including those related to alcohol, drug use, driving, and participation in public gatherings,” and keeping all immigration documents valid and readily accessible.
“It is recommended that you carry copies of your I-94 record, visa documentation, or passport stamps that demonstrate your lawful status,” the email reads.

“The display would still be in a common area there inside the public schools, and the display would be among other historical documents,” Kelley told members of the Senate Education Policy Committee.

Under the legislation, public K-12 schools will be required to display an 11-inch-by-14-inch poster of the Ten Commandments. Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays.
Local school boards do not have to use their state-allocated funds to purchase a poster to display, Gidley said. The legislation does not list any sanctions for schools that do not comply.
“The substitute does not require the LEAs to post the display unless the State Superintendent certifies that donations are available,” Gidley told members of the House Education Policy Committee. 
The Senate version of the bill heard from critics and supporters in March. Most of the critics said the translation of the Ten Commandments in the bill is not an accurate historical account of the Hebrew-derived text. Supporters said the text is the foundation of Western civilization. 
Both bills were approved unanimously by their respective committees and will now be considered by each chamber.

Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, speaks March 25 on the Missouri House floor. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)After a heavy lobbying effort, backers of video lottery games squeezed a slim majority out of the Missouri House on Wednesday, sending a bill promising $350 million a year for schools to the state Senate.
By an 83-73 vote — just one more than the minimum needed to pass — the House approved the bill that also promises to remove “gray market machines” from retail locations.
“This is not a solution in search of a problem,” said the sponsor, Republican Rep. Bill Hardwick of Dixon. “We have a genuine problem, a money problem, a regulatory problem, a commerce problem, and this is a solution for all of that.”
House leadership held the tally board open for more than 15 minutes as they searched for the votes needed to pass. The bill was given first-round approval on Monday but with only 74 votes.
After that backers and opponents scrambled to find votes, with both sides claiming Tuesday that they would prevail.
The bill faces an uncertain future in the state Senate. Three video lottery bills have been proposed in the upper chamber but none have been given a hearing.
In the final vote, 54 Republicans were joined by 29 Democrats to pass the bill, while 18 Democrats and 55 Republicans opposed it. 
Passing video lottery bill would be ‘a heavy lift’ in Missouri Senate

The bill received support from nine of 10 Republicans who were absent on Monday and present on Wednesday. Five GOP members on each side of the question switched from yes to no or vice-versa.
Among Democrats, four members absent on Monday voted yes on Wednesday, while two Monday absentees voted no. Only one Democrat switched sides, voting no on Wednesday after voting yes on Monday. 
Under the bill, the Missouri Lottery would be given the job of licensing video lottery terminal vendors and regulating their use in retail locations. While there would be a cap of eight machines in any location, the total number of machines that would be in use statewide is not capped.
The House added an amendment so counties and cities will be able to authorize — or ban — video lottery games in their home communities. It also added an amendment that declares any unlicensed games that offer cash prizes to winners to be illegal slot machines.
The games resembling casino slot machines that can be seen at retail locations throughout the state are unregulated. Called gray market or “no chance” games, operators claim they are not illegal under current law because a player can learn the outcome of the next play before committing their money.
The options for a player with a pending losing bet are to change games in search of a winner, ending their playing session or deliberately losing the bet to get to the next outcome.
The Missouri State Highway Patrol has tried to initiate prosecutions under anti-gambling laws, but most prosecutors have been reluctant to file charges.
And after years of operation, convenience store owners, fraternal lodges and other establishments have become dependent on the revenue.
The video lottery machines will be more trustworthy, supporters say, because the machines will be required to pay out at least 80% of the money wagered in prizes. 
The remainder will be split three ways — the lottery will receive 34% of the net to support state education programs, with retailers and operators splitting the other 66%. The fiscal note for the bill estimates that within three years, there will be $1.1 billion annually for the three-way split generating approximately $350 million in state revenue.
Some opponents of the measure argue it is not strong enough to force gray market machine operators to shut down. Others said they do not support any expansion of gambling.
“I fully support my American Legion and VFW,” said state Rep. Dean Van Schoiack, a Republican from Savannah, “but they better be able to find a better way to raise funds than stealing from their members and their patrons.”

Sam Zurier offers one way to plug the $32.6 million hole in the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s upcoming budget: increasing the bus agency’s share of the gas tax.
The Providence Democrat’s bill — one of four proposals seeking to solve the cash-strapped bus network’s funding woes — would increase RIPTA’s share of the state’s tax on gasoline from 26% to 30%. It’s a funding strategy that’s garnered support from transit advocates and the agency’s leader.
“With a $32 million shortfall, that’s helpful,” RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand told the Senate Committee on Finance at a hearing on Tuesday.
But the chairman of RIPTA’s board of directors is opposed to the idea, arguing Zurier’s gas tax shift would take away from the state department he leads.
“It would result in an annual loss of approximately $7 million, significantly impacting our capital program,” Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., who the state mandated to steer RIPTA’s board in 2023, wrote to the committee. 
Alviti did not attend Tuesday’s three-hour hearing.
Zurier argued Alviti’s stance goes against RIPTA’s board-supported goal of finding a sustainable funding source — which the gas tax has become less stable as more drivers shift to more fuel-efficient and electric vehicles.
RIPTA now gets about $40 million in annual gasoline tax revenues, based on its existing allocation of 9.75 cents per gallon. That revenue is projected to drop over $1 million when fiscal year 2026 starts July 1, according to projections from the Rhode Island Department of Revenue.
“This would only restore the share RIPTA had,” Zurier said. “It’s very common sense.”
Three other proposals were heard by the committee:

A bill by Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Providence Democrat, would add a 75-cent fee to each fare collected by rideshare companies in order to fund mass transit.
A bill by Sen. Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, would earmark the state’s existing tax on rideshare trips toward mass transit.
A resolution by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, would allocate $32.6 million from the general fund to fill RIPTA’s latest budget gap.

All four bills were held for further study by the committee as is standard procedure for an initial vetting by a legislative panel.
Higher fares, layoffs, pushing ad sales
Realistically, Durand said RIPTA can only cut around $10 million from its deficit because most of the expenses in the agency’s $154 million spending plan are funded with federal money or tied into existing operations.
“There really isn’t a whole lot to trim,” Durand said.
The agency projects about 300 employees losing their jobs if lawmakers don’t provide any new funding.
There are ways RIPTA can try to generate revenue. A presentation Durand gave the committee floated a 5% fare increase, which the agency projects would bring in $470,871 annually. But such a change could decrease ridership by 100,000 trips, according to RIPTA’s presentation. 
Durand had promised the agency’s board of directors last December that raising fares would not be on the table.
Another potential source could be by courting more businesses to buy ad spots on sheltered stops, which the agency projects would bring in $440,000 annually.
Committee Chairman Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, suggested RIPTA could take over non-emergency medical transportation for Medicaid enrollees, something the agency used to provide until the service was privatized some years ago.

About that efficiency study
State leaders are still waiting on RIPTA to submit an independent efficiency study of its operations, as mandated in the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. 
The study was supposed to be done March 1, but the agency’s board of directors delayed the bid process last year until it could find a permanent CEO Durand, who was the interim CEO for seven months, took over the agency permanently last November.
RIPTA’s board finally awarded a contract to do the efficiency study on March 27 to Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP, which likely won’t have a final report complete until the summer — after the General Assembly likely wraps up this year’s legislative session.
Durand provided lawmakers with a two-page memo from WSP detailing how transit agencies nationwide are dealing with ridership and workforce challenges following the pandemic.
DiPalma called the lack of a final study at this point “extremely disappointing.”
“We need facts and data,” he said. “This is not going to satisfy what we need for the budget.”
But DiPalma did not blame Durand for RIPTA’s latest financial crisis, instead placing it on Gov. Dan McKee for leaving it unaddressed in his recommended budget and passing the buck to the General Assembly.
“That’s categorically what happened — we’re given the charge to figure it out, and we’re going to figure it out,” DiPalma said. “Rhode Islanders expect to have a public transit authority that serves their needs — in an efficient and effective manner.”

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.

Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.

The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

(Screenshot courtesy of the Democratic Party of New Mexico)As U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was visiting a conservative charter school in Gallup on Wednesday morning, the head of New Mexico’s Democratic Party held a news conference to denounce Kennedy as a “conspiracy theorist and an amateur cabinet secretary.”
“It’s disgraceful that he’s visiting a part of the state that lost so many lives to COVID, a disease that he consistently spread misinformation about,” said Jessica Velasquez, chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico. “RFK’s platform isn’t just fringe, it’s deadly, especially for people in our rural and tribal areas. He’s proved time and again that he shouldn’t be trusted with our lives, our health or our communities.”
The office of Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren published a schedule showing that it was hosting Kennedy for two hours on Wednesday morning. According to the schedule, Nygren and Kennedy were expected to hike on the Window Rock trail, attend a welcoming address by the head of the nation’s health department, take part in a blessing ceremony and watch a performance by the Dineh Tah’ Navajo Dancers.
The schedule shows Kennedy then headed to Hózhó Academy in the Navajo Nation border town of Gallup, which Source NM on Tuesday revealed to be one likely stop during his visit.
As Kennedy was scheduled to visit the school, Velasquez told reporters in a virtual news conference it’s “ironic” that Kennedy is visiting the Navajo Nation, “which was ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, almost more than any other community in our country.”
The Navajo Nation in May 2020 reported one of the highest per-capita COVID-19 infection rates in the United States. Velasquez said Donald Trump’s first presidential administration botched the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, “and we can’t afford another.”
At least one Indian Health Service building in Gallup is on a list of lease terminations proposed by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” which Velasquez also mentioned on Wednesday.
“Our tribes know the cost of public health failure,” she said. “They experienced one of the highest COVID-19 death rates per capita in the United States. If RFK had been in charge during COVID, I think it’s safe to say that more people would have died, especially in rural and Indigenous communities where access to health care is already limited.”
‘What’s next, polio?’
Velasquez also pointed to the measles outbreak in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas, with nearly 60 cases in New Mexico.
New Mexico’s health department on Tuesday said an unvaccinated child in Chaves County has measles, adding a third county to the ongoing outbreak in the state’s southeastern section.
Velasquez said she has strong feelings about Kennedy’s visit because she has school-aged children, and she “can’t imagine what those families in southern New Mexico are going through, dealing with a disease that should be extinct in this country.”
“The consistent misinformation from Kennedy has contributed to this measles outbreak, a disease that was all but eradicated in the United States,” Velasquez said. “With RFK at the helm at Health and Human Services, what’s next, polio?”
In response to questions on Tuesday from Source about the measles outbreak and Kennedy’s visit, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham noted the HHS Secretary’s remarks over the weekend endorsing the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine after he visited with families in Gaines County, Texas who lost children to the disease.
“I hope that, given that he’s been exposed to measles, I assume he’s now immune, given his age and that I think he got a measles vaccine younger. I don’t know what his entourage looks like and I hope that they are vaccinated and, if they’re not, I hope they’re not coming into New Mexico exposing anyone else, because it would be the worst public-facing engagement of a health secretary in anyone’s lifetime,” she said, adding: “I appreciate that he’s all about the vaccine, but spread is spread.”
Velasquez said John Enders, the scientist who helped culture the virus that causes polio in human muscle and tissue in a laboratory setting, “must be rolling in his grave,” along with Jonas Salk, another scientist who developed the techniques that lead to the polio vaccine, and Louis Pasteur, whose studies helped popularize the germ theory of disease.

Timothy Reeder (R-Pitt) talks about a bill regulating the sale and purchase of edibles containing cannabinoids from hemp. (Photo: Screenshot from NCGA video feed)North Carolina lawmakers have proposed at least nine bills this year that seek more regulation on the sale and purchase of gummies, drinks, and vaping products containing compounds from hemp. 
Most of the bills seek to make it illegal for youth to buy snacks, drinks, and vape products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids or to keep them off school property. Legislators and sheriffs talked about one of the bills, House Bill 680, The Protect Children from Cannabis Act, at a Wednesday news conference. 
The bill would make it illegal for shops to sell consumables containing hemp compounds without a permit, and would make it illegal for people under 21 to buy them. The Alcohol Beverage Control Commission and the ALE would have investigative and enforcement powers. 
“Currently, there’s no age restriction on purchasing these intoxicating cannabinoids, and children do use these and buy these every day,” said Rep. Timothy Reeder (R-Pitt), one of the bill’s primary sponsors.
Onslow County Sheriff Chris Thomas said vape shops have opened near schools in his county to take advantage of the young customer base.
It appears sellers are focusing on young customers, he said, “because the young clientele is a customer for a long time.”
An effort to regulate snacks containing hemp cannabinoids and banning the products from schools faltered last year when the state Senate attached medical marijuana legalization to a House bill. The House and Senate have been at an impasse over medical marijuana for several years. 
Reeder said he anticipates parties interested in regulating edibles will work together to pass a bill this session. “I hope we can do something versus nothing,” he said. 
The Child Fatality Task Force noted in its annual report that the rate of emergency department visits in North Carolina related to cannabis increased 600% for children and teens younger than 17 and by more than 1000% among older teens since 2019. A 2018 federal law legalized hemp. 
The task force recommended banning sales of cannabis or hemp products to people younger than 21, child-resistant packaging, and package warnings.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-09-at-11.05.45-AM-1024x547.png,,,2025-04-09 17:08:21.322950

DemasA group of justice-focused civil rights groups have called on the University of Michigan to maintain commitments to diversity and inclusion as students pursue their careers.
The Legal Defense Fund, or LDF, announced it sent the university’s administration a letter Tuesday, alongside the National Women’s Law Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Latino Justice, in an effort to push back against federal pressures to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies.
The push comes in response to emails LDF says in a news release students at the University of Michigan’s law school received recently from a conservative group asserting the university unfairly expresses preferences for certain students under DEI policies, amid Trump’s executive order to withhold federal funding for organizations and programs with DEI policies.
Late last month U of M announced it would be closing its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion with university officials saying that the school would pivot their efforts to “core responsibilities”.
According to LDF, students are already seeing the consequences of divestment into diversity with a mass email that was sent out to students at the law school from conservative group Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences or FASORP.

The group is represented by prominent conservative attorneys Jonathan Mitchell, regarded as the legal mind behind anti-abortion heartbeat laws and Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff.
According to LDF, the letter that was sent to students in the law school on March 31 alleged that the Michigan Law Review, the university’s law journal, shows discriminatory preference towards women, students of color and LGBTQ+ students, with the implication that students of those demographics are not deserving of being published by the journal.
“We strongly condemn these threats as an unjust attack on students’ abilities and an attempt to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination,” LDF said in a news release. “No student should be told that their identity makes them undeserving of their accomplishments. We hope the University of Michigan Law School will further affirm its commitment to diversity, equal opportunity, and excellence, ensuring that the hard work and talents of students from all backgrounds are valued and respected.”
FASORP and the University of Michigan did not respond to requests for comment from Michigan Advance.

“We are working with the students to help them connect with appropriate legal resources and understand their options. CSU is providing support based on students’ personal choices and decisions,” CSU spokesperson Nik Olsen said in a statement.
CU in a statement said federal agencies have not shared any reasons for the student visa revocations with the university. 
Both universities declined to provide additional information to protect the privacy of affected students.
The number of Colorado students who lost their visas doubled from the counts the universities provided a week ago: four students from CU and six students from CSU.
President Donald Trump in issued an executive order targeting student visas of those who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and another instructing the Department of State to review visa programs to ensure no foreign nationals pose a threat to national security. Many international students across the United States have had their visas revoked. Secretary of State Marco Rubio late last month put the number at 300.

(Photo by Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)Republicans in the Minnesota Senate and House on Wednesday were unconvinced by Democrats’ proposal to implement a first-in-the-nation tax on social media companies that collect data on Minnesotans, arguing the costs of the comparatively small tax on the nation’s largest corporations that earn billions annually would eventually trickle down to middle-class Minnesotans.
The bill, chief authored by Senate Taxes Committee Chair Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, would impose an excise tax on social media companies based on the number of monthly active Minnesota consumers from whom the company collects data.
Minnesota is facing a looming multi-billion dollar budget deficit, and lawmakers are working to cut spending and generate new revenue to offset the imbalance — the new tax on social media is among the ideas.
Under the bill (SF 3197), the largest social media companies — those that have over 1 million Minnesota consumers — would be taxed $165,000 per month, plus 50 cents times the number of consumers over 1 million.
The Department of Revenue estimates the tax would apply to 14 social media companies. The tax would begin in January 2026 and would generate around $46 million in the first fiscal year, $92 million in the second and about $100 million annually after that.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, reported $62 billion in profit in 2024, on $164 billion in revenue.
Republicans on the Senate Taxes Committee said the new tax would hurt Minnesota businesses. Local businesses advertise on social media, and platforms like Facebook and Instagram would pass on the cost of the tax onto Minnesota businesses, said Sen. Bill Weber, R-Luverne.
“Quite frankly, if you don’t believe that the cost of their advertising is going to go up as a result of a new tax, I think you’re kidding yourself. It is going to be a cost to Minnesotans at the end of the day,” Weber said.
Rest on Wednesday acknowledged that the bill will likely lead to litigation, as companies could interpret the legislation to be in violation of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibits state and local governments from imposing taxes directly on internet access or online activity.
University of California Davis School of Law Professor Darien Shanske, who studies digital taxation, testified that Minnesota would have a strong case.
“It would be inappropriate for legislatures to give up on sound tax policy in the face of novel legal arguments that will ultimately be defeated,” Shanske told the Senate Taxes Committee Wednesday. Courts have generally ruled in states’ favor in disputes over revenue generators, he said.
Even as social media companies make hundreds of billions of profit, social scientists are sounding the alarm on the widespread use of the apps, especially by young people.
Democrats on the Senate Taxes Committee framed the tax as one worth fighting for, resembling sin taxes on tobacco and alcohol.
Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, compared the social media tax to state taxes on mining. When you mine the earth, Hauschild said, companies pay taxes so people in the area can benefit from social services funded by mining taxes. The same should be done for social media, he argued.
“These are leeches on our society. Leeches that we have come to accept, but they are leeches nonetheless,” Hauschild said of the billionaires who run social media companies. “There’s no reason that we shouldn’t, as Minnesotans, decide to fight the fight, take the legal recourse and try to tax these people who are benefiting most from us.”

Avelo, a smaller airline that operates flights out of Hartford’s Bradley International and Tweed New Haven airports, came under fire during a meeting of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee Tuesday. 
Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said Avelo doesn’t pay Connecticut’s aviation fuel tax, calling the arrangement “a backstop against losses here in the state.”
Stafstrom said, “State taxpayers are helping prop that company up and keep that company operational. But then they turn around and they are then using those same planes that we’re helping to subsidize, to deport individuals out of this country. 
“I don’t think that’s how we should be spending our state tax dollars,” he said.
The committee was discussing a bill that seeks to modify a state law known as the Trust Act, which regulates how local and state police cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The Trust Act generally prohibits Connecticut law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from ICE that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up — with some exceptions.
The original version of House Bill 7212 sought to expand the Trust Act to prohibit public agencies in the state from sharing information with ICE about a person’s home address, workplace, school or “the date, time or location of a person’s hearings, proceedings or appointments with the public agency.” 
Now, in the wake of Avelo’s deal with DHS, members of the Judiciary Committee are seeking to further expand the bill, adding companies to the entities that could be prohibited from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is an arm of the Department of Homeland Security.
The new language in the bill would require that “any principal or key personnel of the person, firm or corporation” that decides to apply for a contract with a state agency “will not cooperate with any federal immigration authority or engage in any contract for purposes of the detention, holding or transportation of an individual” protected under the state’s Trust Act.
If the company refuses, the state would be directed to award the contract instead “to the next highest ranked proposer or the next lowest responsible qualified bidder” or to seek new bids. 
Hundreds of people submitted testimony or testified in person at a public hearing in March, when the original version of the bill — which was put forward by Democratic lawmakers — and another bill encouraging closer cooperation among ICE and local law enforcement — which was submitted by Republicans — were heard by the Judiciary Committee. Of the nearly 200 people who testified in person, nearly all were in favor of restricting collaboration with federal immigration enforcement. 
At the Judiciary Committee meeting Tuesday, members both debated the new language in H.B. 7212 and voted to advance the bill for consideration by the state House of Representatives. The Republican proposal, H.B. 7211, did not receive a vote. 
During the meeting, Republicans on the committee continued to protest H.B. 7212 as a whole, saying it would endanger public safety and that it wrongly went against the federal government’s authority. 
Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, in the Tuesday meeting asked whether places of business would be penalized for complying with a judicial warrant, one of the exceptions allowed under the Trust Act in which local law enforcement must cooperate with ICE. 
“ If a federal immigration authority shows up to a nonprofit, say, that’s partly state funded and they have a warrant to enter, I would hope that individual will be able to cooperate with a judicial warrant,” said Howard.
Stafstrom said a judicial warrant would override the prohibitions in the bill, and that he would be open to adding clarifying language to the bill. 
Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin, said the federal government has declared certain “criminal prison gangs” to be international terrorist organizations and it’s deporting people thought to be members of this gang. 
“ That’s how you make this state and this country safer,” Dubitsky said. “You get rid of the criminal gangs. You get rid of the criminals, you get rid of these sex offenders, the murderers, the drug dealers. That’s how you make us safe. Throwing sticks in the spokes of the federal law enforcement that is trying to do that does not make us safe.”
“ Federal immigration officials are coming to this state to get these people. They are coming. There isn’t anything we can do about it.”
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said the federal government has “exclusive jurisdiction” over immigration and federal law is “supreme” over state law. 
“ It’s important that our federal law enforcement is able to cooperate with local law enforcement with regard to enforcing federal law. Any action by anybody — especially by the states — to impede that, to hold that back and slow it down is, in my mind, unconstitutional and un-American,” he said. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, pushed back.
“ It’s not un-American to support this. What’s un-American is to take people out of this country because they use the freedoms that we all enjoy, whether we’re citizens or not, to speak up — to say what we see,” said Winfield. “What’s un-American is to have a country where folks have to live in fear because they’re doing the day-to-day … they’re just living, raising their children, working and they don’t know from day to day what’s going to happen. That’s the essence of what this bill is about.” 
H.B. 7212 passed out of the committee with a vote of 29-12.
The same day the bill passed, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong sent a letter to Avelo CEO Andrew Levy asking questions about its policies for deportation flights and expressing “deep disappointment” at the company’s decision to contract with the Department of Homeland Security.
“Absent clear, public commitments to safety and the rule of law, the Office of the Attorney General may be forced to recommend that Connecticut rescind its support for and partnership with Avelo,” Tong wrote. 
Courtney Goff, communications manager for Avelo, told the Connecticut Mirror in an email that the company was in the midst of reviewing the attorney general’s letter and would “communicate directly with the state of Connecticut.” 
On Wednesday evening, about 50 people gathered outside of Tweed Airport in New Haven to protest Avelo’s decision to contract with DHS. The group held signs and marched, chanting, “Don’t let your vacation fund deportation.” The protest was organized by advocacy groups Unidad Latina in Accion and Shoreline United.
John Jairo Lugo, an organizer with Unidad Latina in Accion, said he believes the state shouldn’t subsidize fuel for Avelo. “ Right now, these companies, they are signing contacts … to make profits on the suffering in our community,” he said.
An online petition calling on people to boycott Avelo has gathered nearly 18,000 signatures on so far.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SRR_Avelo-protest040925_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

The bill would bring honeybees in line with the tax protocol of other livestock, which are exempt from state sales tax.
Richard Vonderohe, a beekeeper in Mason City and president of the North Iowa Beekeepers Club, said the bill would help beekeepers, — especially those who have suffered from bee losses over the winter.

Commercial beekeepers lost on average 62% of their colonies from June 2024 to January 2025, according to results from a survey of beekeepers, administered by Project Apis m. and other bee industry groups.
Project Apis called it the largest honeybee loss recorded in the country, and estimated the economic impact, caused by lost revenue and the cost of replacing colonies, to be $600 million on beekeepers. The broader economic impact could be even greater, as honeybees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of U.S. crops, annually, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Researchers are uncertain what is causing the losses, though many, including Vonderohe, wonder if commercial pesticide use is to blame. Honeybee colonies can also be harmed by parasites, disease and starvation. 
“I’ve had enough losses,” Vonderohe said. “We need help with our bees.”
Rep. Mike Vondran, R-Dubuque, called House File 247 the “sweetest bill” of the day. He said exempting honeybees from the state tax has a fiscal note of less than $20,000 annually.
“But it’ll really do a lot with regard to helping spur on a growing industry in the state of Iowa,” Vondran said. 
Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, supported the bill that she said has had “lots of buzz.” 
According to USDA report from March, Iowa has around 41,000 honeybee colonies, though this number is likely higher as USDA only reports on producers with five colonies or more. 
HF 247, called a “bee-utiful bill” by Vondran in his closing remarks, passed unanimously from the committee and is now eligible for floor debate.
More than just honeybees 
There are more than 4,000 native bee species in the country and according to the U.S. Geological Survey, bees are the primary pollinators for the majority of agricultural crops.
While they won’t get any honey out of the deal, Iowans have an opportunity this summer to engage with native bee populations as part of a national survey project.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is seeking participants in its second Bumble Bee Atlas and will host online trainings April 19 and May 10.
The citizen science project aims to identify the bumblebee species of Iowa, where they’re located and their preferences in flowers. 
Last year, participants conducted nearly 150 surveys and identified 10 bumblebee species. The brown-belted bumblebee was the most common species identified last year and DNR estimates there are more species to be found in Iowa.  
Participants need a net, cellphone or other camera, bee-holding container, a cooler and about 45-minutes to dedicate to catching and identifying bees. Those interested can register online.
Twenty states participate in the Bumble Bee Atlas and collectively have observed 36 species of bumble bees and engaged more than 4,000 citizen scientists.

“Mark my words, Florida citrus is not going down on my watch. We’re on the edge of something special. Florida citrus is making a comeback, one tree at a time,” Senate President Ben Albritton said in a news release.
“This heritage industry is not only vital to our state’s economy, but it is truly a part of our DNA. Citrus has been a pillar of our state since the 1500s, serving as a key economic driver within our vital agricultural industry.”
The remaining $10 million would go to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for an 80% cost-share with citrus packinghouses for equipment maintenance or purchase.
FAMU research
While the Senate focuses on funding research to revive the citrus industry (Albritton is a fourth generation citrus farmer), it is looking to support farmers who could grow other crops in the meantime.
The Senate cast unanimous yeas to research crops better suited to sustain Florida’s agriculture industry as citrus greening ravages the state’s crop of pride. 
Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat representing parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, led SB 178, which would commission a Florida A&M University study to determine whether there are “viable crops or products” that agricultural producers could raise instead of citrus. 
Citrus industry, ‘decimated’ by greening, clings to hope, Simpson says

“FAMU is uniquely positioned to lead this study as a university with a strong history of agricultural research,” Rouson said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “Their expertise will ensure that the study will provide practical and science-based recommendations to support our growers and maintain Florida’s leadership in agriculture.”
The Senate budget proposes $1 million in general revenue for the study. 
FAMU, if appropriated the money, would research alternative crops’ environmental impact, suitability to Florida’s climate, and expected economic benefit.

‘Decimated’
Over the past 20 years, the citrus industry in Florida has declined by 90%. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Florida farmers produced nearly 300 million boxes of citrus in 2004. By 2024, harvests yielded about 20 million boxes. The forecast for 2025 is 14.1 million boxes, according to the USDA.
Citrus greening, the insect-carried tree disease that first hit Florida in 2005, has “decimated” the industry, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Jan. 14. Psyllids, or plant lice, infect citrus trees, damaging yields and ultimately killing the tree.
In 2019, citrus farmers reported that about 80% of their trees were infected. 
Researchers at the University of Florida announced earlier this year that they’ve found “one of the most promising discoveries to date” related to greening, although growers are still about five years away from determining how effective UF’s findings are. 
The bill heads to the House, which does not have a companion bill.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Trump administration has so far cancelled $296,455,163 in federal funds promised to Minnesota, with an additional $55,989,150 in funding temporarily disrupted.
Those figures come from a new Walz administration tracker of federal funding pauses and recissions, which officials say will now be updated daily.
“By tracking these changes, we’re doing what we can to keep Minnesotans informed on what we know and what’s to come,” Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. “Decisions made by billionaires in Washington are cutting real programs that save Minnesotans money, monitor disease outbreaks, and keep us safe.”
The bulk of the funding cancellations, totaling roughly $230 million, affect the Minnesota Department of Health, which has been forced to lay off 170 employees in grant-funded positions. Another 20 employees who were slated to start new positions with MDH have had those offers rescinded.
The largest contributor to the MDH cuts is the cancellation of $179 million from the CDC, for “flexible funding” to respond to future infectious disease outbreaks. 
The Minnesota Department of Education is losing $18 million in higher education funding, while the Department of Human Services is reporting a loss of around $27 million to help people with substance abuse and mental health problems.
Additionally, the Department of Agriculture is losing $18 million in funding for programs that purchase local food for schools and food shelves.
Nearly all of the federal funds the state lists as “temporarily disrupted” would affect the Department of Public Safety. Those funds consist of FEMA grants to help the department prevent and respond to natural disasters and terror threats.
“One in every three dollars Minnesota state government spends currently comes from the federal government,” said Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell. “Consistent, timely access to federal dollars is needed to continue providing the services Minnesotans depend on.”
The figures included in the state tracker do not include funding cuts to colleges, non-profits, and other non-governmental organizations. Those cuts, depending on how they’re implemented, could add tens of millions or more to the totals, including for medical research conducted by institutions like the Mayo Clinic.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250405_1035-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 16:10:50.699121

Chris Van Hollen and Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey, whose district includes the family’s home in Beltsville, criticized the Trump administration for not only accidentally deporting Abrego Garcia, but labeling him as a MS-13 gang member, despite his lack of a criminal record in any country, including the U.S.“He was whisked off without any due process, and is now in a torturous … jail in El Salvador,” Van Hollen said.Senators send letterIn 2019 Abrego Garcia was given removal orders to his home country. He was granted protections from removal by an immigration judge because it was more “likely than not that he would be persecuted by gangs in El Salvador"" if he were returned, according to court documents.On Tuesday, two dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, demanding  Abrego Garcia be returned to the U.S.The Trump administration was ordered by a federal judge to return Abrego Garcia by Monday, and while the order was unanimously held up by a panel of judges on an appeals court, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily paused the deadline to return Abrego Garcia.The high court will make a full decision on whether or not the Trump administration will be required to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.",,,,2025-04-09 16:10:50.699121

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill that would repeal the work permit requirements for West Virginia 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment is nearing a vote in the House of Delegates.
The House Government Organization Committee on Wednesday signed off on Senate Bill 427 on Wednesday. 
The minimum legal age to work in West Virginia is 14. Currently, state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent. The permit includes age certification, a commitment by the employer to employ the child legally, a description of the work the child is applying to do, a signature by the child’s principal saying that they’re attending school, and parental consent. 
If SB 427 becomes law, employers seeking to hire the teenagers would be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. 
The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things. 
The committee adopted an amendment from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, that the job description listed on an age certificate be supplied by the employer as opposed to the child. 
Brooke Farber, deputy commissioner and counsel for the state Division of Labor, testified that the agency prefers that the job description come from the employer to ensure that the job doesn’t violate restrictions on children working in hazardous working conditions. State and federal law prohibits minors from working in certain hazardous occupations, including roofing, mining, operating fork lifts and others. 
“We just want to make sure, and a 14 or 15 year old might not necessarily be familiar with a hazardous occupation, so that would be it,” she said. 
The bill will next go to the floor of the House of Delegates to be read three times before delegates vote on the bill.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kayla-Young-20250409.jpg,,,2025-04-09 16:10:50.699121

His executive order, issued Tuesday, directs the Department of Justice to challenge a huge swath of state laws and regulations. The order aims at measures that seek to cut carbon emissions, penalize energy companies and limit drilling permits. It also targets state-led lawsuits against fossil fuel companies over the damages caused by climate change.
Trump’s directive orders Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement” of any state laws related to climate change, including any that are seen as “burdening” the use of domestic energy resources. Such language could include state laws that mandate a transition to clean electricity sources.
The order specifically calls out “climate Superfund” policies in Vermont and New York, which require fossil fuel companies to pay for some of the damages caused by climate change. It also targets California’s cap-and-trade law, which places a limit on emissions through auctions of carbon credits.
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

While Trump’s order says such state policies are unconstitutional, climate-focused state leaders say his administration has no legal basis to unravel their efforts.
“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement from the U.S. Climate Alliance. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”
Hochul and Lujan Grisham co-chair the alliance, a coalition of 24 governors focused on reducing emissions.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Politico that the order is “toothless.”
“[Trump] has no authority on his own to nullify state laws,” he told the outlet.
But the order throws the might of the federal government into a sprawling legal battle over states’ authority to set climate policy and seek damages for disasters.
It could force states to face expensive litigation and years of legal uncertainty. Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and elsewhere have at times been hostile to environmental regulations. And it’s unclear whether the order will have a chilling effect on state efforts to craft more climate legislation.

Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, seeks to block obscene content from reaching children. (Getty Images)Following passage of laws last session requiring adult websites to require age verification, a bill in the Montana Legislature seeks to go a step further and add a filter on electronic devices.
House Bill 408, brought by Rep. Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, seeks to block obscene content from reaching children and establishes liability for someone who removes the filter as well the device manufacturer.
The bill was tabled in the Senate Judiciary Committee, though it could come back.
“Nothing is truly considered dead until sine die,” Regier said.
Protection from content deemed harmful to children, especially surrounding technology, has been key to a number of bills this session. 
“Parents have the ultimate responsibility to train their children in moral and character development. Modern technology has potential for great good but also harm. Montana can help parents and protect our children,” Regier said in an emailed comment to the Daily Montanan. “Requiring a device filter to be activated for all minors helps to safeguard against obscene content. Obscene content that can lead to risky behaviors, addictions and vulnerability to sexual predators.”
The bill passed the House 82-19 on third reading to move it over to the Senate, with the dissent including a mix of Republicans and Democrats.
In its Senate hearing, proponents included the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, the Montana Family Foundation and Alex Sterhan with the Montana Department of Justice.
Former Republican Montana State Rep. Scott Reichner, speaking for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said the legislation would help with the “mass spread of human trafficking in the state.”
Opponents to the bill included the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Montana Chamber of Commerce, the Parkview Institute — an organization that supports economic freedom — as well as the Computer & Communications Industry Association.
Their argument was HB 408 was a barrier to businesses and an increase in potential liability.
“HB 408 presents serious technical and legal issues. Internet service providers, not device manufacturers, are the ones equipped to manage content access,” Aodhan Downey, state policy manager for CCIA, said in a statement. “Requiring a state-specific default filter not only creates unworkable compliance challenges but also leaves many devices — especially those without location-tracking or that are sold online — beyond the bill’s regulatory reach.
“What’s more, the bill imposes steep penalties based on vague determinations of obscenity, leaving businesses to either over-filter lawful content or face costly litigation.”
Some opponents stated it would stifle competition or could wrongly censor classical artwork that contains nudity. A similar bill has floated around the Utah Legislature.
Legislators in Senate Judiciary supported the spirit of the bill, but did have some concerns. 
“I think it’s a great effort, but I don’t think it’s the solution,” Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, said on April 8 when the committee took executive action on the bill.
Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, said she was originally going to support the bill, saying she did recognize the state had a “very serious problem” with minors accessing obscene content. But “untended consequences” on device manufacturers helped sway her decision.
“I think we have done some very good work in this body in past sessions and the reports are that it’s working,” Manzella said during executive action. “Another issue is that I support parental rights, and I support parental responsibility to parent their children and work through these issues with their children.”

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina drivers caught holding or scrolling on their cellphones while driving would face upwards of $100 in fines under legislation approved by the House. Repeat offenders could see their insurance rates increase.
The “hands-free” bill was approved 85-25 on Wednesday. All but three of the “no” votes came from Republicans.
A perfunctory third reading, expected Thursday, will send the measure to the Senate.
“We’ve all seen people going down the highway. They’re driving blind. They are not looking at the road,” Rep. Bill Taylor told reporters after the vote. “They are six times more dangerous than a drunk driver. It has got to stop.”
The Aiken Republican has long been a proponent. But for more than two decades, the state Legislature has ducked such efforts.
Now, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is threatening the state with the loss of $50 million or more in annual federal highway funding.
A 2011 federal rule required states to pass laws banning handheld cellphone use for drivers of commercial vehicles, but proposals failed in the House year after year.
In 2022, the Senate passed a version of the legislation, but that one never even reached the House floor.
Without a hands-free driving law, SC could lose upwards of $40M in federal road funding

Late last year, the federal agency sent a warning letter to Gov. Henry McMaster’s office and the state Department of Motor Vehicles: Put a law in place by July 2025, or the federal government will start docking 4% of funding it sends to the state for road construction. The penalty would go up to 8% every year after that until the law is changed.
Under the proposal, drivers caught holding a cellphone — either in their hand or in their lap — reading a text, or watching videos would be fined $100 on first offense. Each additional violation in a three-year span would cost $200 and add two points to a driver’s license.
Those points impact a person’s car insurance rates, acting as a deterrent, Taylor said.
Hands-free phone calls and voice-to-text messaging would still be legal. Stiff penalties for drivers who severely injure or kill someone while distracted by a cellphone were removed from an earlier version of the bill.
The House also added a measure requiring officers to have an “unobstructed view” of a person holding or using their cell phone before they have the probable cause necessary to pull them over.
If ultimately passed, the law would take effect a year after it’s either signed by the governor or becomes law without his signature.
For the first three months of enforcement, police officers would write warning citations only.

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in several states are pushing bills to prohibit unauthorized sales of hard-to-get restaurant reservations.
Proposed bills in California, Florida, Illinois and Louisiana take aim at online platforms such as Appointment Trader that allow diners to sell coveted reservations on the open market — sometimes without a restaurant’s knowledge.
In Louisiana, the issue gained attention surrounding February’s Super Bowl, when one customer paid more than $2,000 for a table at a top New Orleans restaurant, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Proponents of the platforms say these services provide customer flexibility and can boost restaurant business. But restaurant groups have opposed their entry into the market, arguing that they undermine the dining experience and can leave restaurants with empty tables.
The Illinois and Louisiana legislation follows New York state’s Restaurant Reservation Anti-Piracy Act, which went into effect in February. The law aims at curbing the “black market” in which reservations are scooped up as soon as they go live, Gothamist reported.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association asked state lawmakers to file a similar measure.
Wendy Waren, spokesperson for the association, told the Louisiana Illuminator that online platforms are selling reservations without restaurant’s permission or knowledge. If no one purchases reservations, tables can sit empty, preventing legitimate customers from getting a reservation, Waren said.
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

The Republican-sponsored bill, which would require platforms to have contracts with restaurants, is pending before the state House Commerce Committee.
A similar bill just won unanimous approval from the Illinois state House and now moves onto the state Senate for consideration.
The legislation would require a written agreement between restaurants and reservation platforms and would create a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation of the new law.
State Rep. Margaret Croke, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, characterized the move as a “commonsense” measure to protect restaurants and consumers alike.
“At a time when local restaurants are operating with extremely tight margins and working to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, they shouldn’t have to deal with third-party services snatching up their reservations and selling them at a premium, which leads to no-shows and confusion that only hurts their bottom lines,” Croke said in a statement.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

The laws do not affect a restaurant’s ability to contract with reservation platforms such as OpenTable and Resy, which have applauded state crackdowns on other third-party sites.
Jonas Frey, who founded Appointment Trader, told the New York Times he launched the platform to help people get tables for a “fair market price.”
Last summer, he acknowledged that computer bots making reservations and then selling them were an issue, and said he had tried to prevent them from exploiting the website. But he said his website had only become popular because it was already difficult to get a reservation, especially in the New York City area.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  A Senate subcommittee moved forward with the second step in amending the state constitution Wednesday to require a two-thirds majority vote of the Legislature for income tax increases.
Senate Study Bill 1221 is a follow-up from House Joint Resolution 2006, passed in 2024 with the same language. To amend the Iowa Constitution, lawmakers must pass the amendment language in two consecutive general assemblies, before the measure goes before voters on a general election ballot for final approval. If the measure is approved in the 2025 or 2026 legislative session, the amendment will appear on Iowans’ ballots in the Nov. 5, 2026 election.
Several advocates spoke in favor of the legislation at the subcommittee meeting, saying that it will provide more certainty to individuals and businesses that their taxes will not increase. Opponents argued the measure will limit state lawmakers’ ability to respond to financial crises.

Mike Owen with Common Good Iowa, a progressive policy organization, said he was opposed to the measure not only because “it puts the thumb on the scale for bad tax policy,” but because it violates the “basic principle of one person, one vote,” giving significantly more power to lawmakers who oppose tax increases.
“That 17 senators could block the will of 133 other legislators and the governor is absurd,” Owen said. “That would be the case if the two-thirds requirement were made the other way, to lower taxes, or for any other policy matter to come before you. Locking in decisions now by representatives and senators who are elected for only two- and four-year terms disrespects future legislators and future voters who choose them, for years to come.”
Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, who did not sign off on the bill, said the Iowa Legislature has always been “very judicious” in making tax policy decisions since she took office. However, she said Iowa, alongside the rest of the country, is in “uncharted waters” with cuts to federal aid and economic volatility caused by tariffs. Federal financial uncertainties, combined with Gov. Kim Reynolds’ budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 being higher than projected state revenues, show the need for Iowa lawmakers to have the ability to make the best tax decisions for Iowa.
“This causes me great concern, and I don’t necessarily think this is the time that we would pass something like this, that would take away one of the tools that we currently have,” Winckler said. “Always, we are very careful in increasing any kind of cost to Iowans. But we need to have the tools in the event that we need them.”
Tyler Raygor with Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization, said the measure was a “prudent safeguard” for Iowa taxpayers. He said when tax increases may be necessary, he believed Iowa lawmakers would be able to reach a consensus, pointing to the deal reached in March 2020 to keep the state government funded during COVID-related shutdowns.
“In emergencies, we believe the Legislature can work together if it ever was necessary to raise taxes,” he said. “But in the event that it is, we think having a broad consensus requiring two-thirds is prudent.”
Raygor also pushed back against comments that the proposed constitutional amendment would unfairly restrict future lawmakers’ actions.
Jake Highfill with Iowans for Tax Relief was among other supporters of the measure who said amending Iowa’s constitution is a difficult process when compared to other states like California that allow ballot initiatives, meaning the measure will be difficult to reverse in the future.
“Something like this will outlive all of us,” Highfill said, calling the proposed constitutional amendment “one of the best policies you guys are going to pass this General Assembly.”
Sens. Jason Schultz, R-Schleswig, and Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, voted to advance the bill. It will need approval by the full Ways and Means Committee before it advances to the Senate floor.
“I think people are waiting to vote on this, and it’s our job to get it to them on a ballot,” Schultz said.
In 2024, the original version of the amendment also included language that would have enshrined a flat income tax rate in the state constitution — preventing future lawmakers from returning to a graduated tax rate system that places a higher income tax rate on people with higher incomes. This proposal gained approval last year as a separate measure, Senate Joint Resolution 2004. Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, said in 2024 these measures were separated so Iowans would have the opportunity to weigh in on both proposals as independent items on a ballot.
The proposed amendment requiring Iowa to have a single rate income tax has not been filed so far this session — it would also have to be passed by the lawmakers during the current general assembly to make it on to the ballot.

California Democrats are backing a legislative proposal that would allow gig workers to form unions. Expect big pushback from companies like Uber, Lyft and Doordash.


After years of tussling with gig companies, California’s labor unions want to once again expand workers’ rights — this time by allowing ride-hailing drivers to unionize.
And as in tussles past, expect steep opposition from the businesses.
Backed by California’s Service Employees International Union, Democratic lawmakers unveiled a measure Tuesday that would allow drivers to bargain with companies like Uber and Lyft for better pay and benefits, a step toward more protections for gig workers. 
“We stand for the principles that all work has dignity,” said Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who introduced Assembly Bill 1340, at a Tuesday press conference. “We stand for the right of every worker to truly have a voice.” 
The SEIU said more than 600,000 ride-hail drivers statewide would benefit if the legislation is adopted and signed into law. 
Uber said in a statement that the proposed legislation would make rides in California more expensive “while threatening the flexible jobs thousands depend on.”
“Drivers have been clear: They want to stay independent and keep the freedom to choose when and how they work, with access to meaningful benefits,” the statement said.
Lyft spokesperson CJ Macklin declined to tell CalMatters where the company stands on the measure, but said that Proposition 22, approved by voters in 2020, reflected voters’ will and that the company is working to “improve drivers’ experience.”
The effort for worker unionization mirrors a voter-approved ballot measure in Massachusetts, the first state to give app-based drivers the right to collective bargaining. 
Uber and Lyft have so far won the labor battle
In California, the effort comes nearly five years after rideshare companies blocked an attempt to recognize gig workers as employees. 
A state law that took effect in 2020, known as AB 5, would likely have entitled those workers to unemployment benefits, minimum wage and more. But gig companies fought it in court and poured more than $200 million into Prop. 22. Voters approved the ballot measure to keep gig workers as independent contractors while the companies promised better benefits the same year. Companies like Lyft, Uber, DoorDash and Instacart spent tens of millions of dollars — more than 10 times the opposition — in support of Prop. 22. After its passage, gig companies raised their prices. 
But no state agency has been enforcing Prop. 22 since it took effect, leaving workers waiting years in hopes of their wage and benefits complaints being resolved.
The passage of Prop. 22 snuffed out hope for gig workers to be recognized as employees in California, said Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, president of the California Labor Federation, who authored AB 5 as a member of the Legislature. She said this year’s proposal is second-best to the initial law. 
“We think the right to collectively bargain around a number of issues as independent contractors is far superior to nothing,” she said in an interview. “We are supportive of this, but it obviously is not what we had originally hoped for.”

At the Tuesday event, many ride-hail drivers deemed Prop. 22 an empty promise from companies like Uber and Lyft, arguing that the companies did not deliver on better wages and benefits.
“Now, we are just their money makers,” said Francisco Magdaleno, a ride-hail driver of nine years in Los Angeles. “This is why we love to have a union. I want us drivers to be able to negotiate, to make things better for everybody.”
But details remain unclear: The measure does not define which drivers would be eligible for collective bargaining or how many votes a union would need from its members to be certified. 
Some labor advocates believe lawmakers should go further to try to protect workers, such as setting a minimum wage floor or explicitly protecting workers’ right to strike.
The language of Prop. 22 guaranteed that companies would pay drivers 120% of minimum wage, which translated to payments ranging from $5.64 to $27.58 per hour. Nicole Moore, president of Rideshare Drivers United, said that was too low.
“If you are going to call that a wage floor, it’s really a wage dungeon,” she said, arguing the new legislation should also set a higher wage floor for ride-hailing drivers. 
The proposal is expected to be heard in Assembly committees in a few weeks.

In a statement to StateImpact, Oklahoma State University spokesperson Mack Burke said eight OSU student visas have been recently revoked by the federal government. He did not provide further information as to the reasons behind the revocations or if the students had been deported.
According to the statement, OSU is monitoring the situation and “providing appropriate guidance and support to those impacted.”
The University of Central Oklahoma told StateImpact “as many as four” of its students have had visas revoked.
A recent report by Inside Higher Ed found roughly 150 students at 50 institutions have had their visas revoked, though the actual number is likely higher. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the U.S. has revoked 300 or more student visas, calling the affected persons “lunatics.”
A spokesperson for the University of Oklahoma said it was unable to confirm if any of its students have been affected due to student privacy laws.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)What could be more Republican than the two-year state budget under construction in Concord? Revenue is down, in part because the GOP keeps cutting and repealing taxes to help out corporations and the wealthy, and meanwhile hundreds of state positions are being cut, critical agencies eliminated, and spending on public services slashed. But guess what’s expanding? A school voucher program that siphons money away from public education and gives it to private and religious schools, at a budgeted cost of $91 million over the biennium.  
All this while the Republican-controlled federal government snatches back critical funding while extorting compliance from state governments and institutions, all to serve the whims of a couple of bomb-tossing billionaires.
Classic.
But this is exactly what the majority of people in America and New Hampshire chose last November, and voters can’t even claim to have been misled. This mess is what the GOP was openly selling, the whole time, and they found plenty of willing buyers.
So hats off to the Republicans, who are pretty awesome at winning elections. The fact that they win despite running against services that benefit the people themselves makes it all the more impressive. And it really all starts at the top.
“Make America Great Again” is just genius sloganeering, for the past decade inviting every disaffected, disillusioned, and disgruntled American to assign their favored era to the key word “again.” That little trick alone is worth countless millions of votes — and enduring, head-in-the-sand support — in this wistful society with its walleyed fixation on bleached past glories. But when you’re as talented as this administration at conjuring all of the supposed enemies (migrants, LGBTQ people, public educators, doctors, etc.) conspiring to block good, hard-working people from returning to the “again” times, that’s a sure-fire winner at the polls. 
Nostalgia + insecurity = electoral victory. It’s simple math.
Here in New Hampshire, all Republican Kelly Ayotte had to do to win the corner office in this environment was copy the blueprint, and so she came up with “Don’t Mass Up New Hampshire” and locked in on some of the same “threats” isolated by Trump. She even copied billionaire Elon Musk’s DOGE with millionaire Craig Benson’s COGE to attack that towering, undefined enemy known as The Bureaucracy. While Ayotte inherited some of what’s punitive in this state budget, it’s got her party’s fingerprints all over it. And she’s been a champion of the same bad policies that helped lead us here — tax cuts and repeals, the maniacal expansion of vouchers, arbitrarily redefining what it means to be “vulnerable” in order to legitimize cuts — while simultaneously avoiding the herd of elephants in the room: punishing property taxes, the prohibitive costs of scarce housing, a lack of investment in child care, etc. (So many etc.’s.)
Ayotte proved that you don’t need any new ideas to notch a W in the Granite State. It’s enough to be anti-Massachusetts.
Tax cuts + gutting public services and education + downshifting costs to property-tax payers + Massachusetts stinks = victory in New Hampshire. Again, that electoral math is straightforward. (The equation, slightly more complex than the president’s, is unironically called The New Hampshire Advantage.)
It would be a mistake, though, to assume what’s happening in Concord and D.C. is part of some painful transition to something else, something better. This, right now, is in fact the Republican destination. Always was.
If you think about the human predilection for compact narratives — the clarity of white-hat/black-hat politics and policies — it adds up that Republicans are good at winning elections. But unfortunately for all but the top wealth holders in the nation, their economic orthodoxy is incompatible with good governance. That’s true In New Hampshire just as it is in D.C. It’s not just the obvious terrible choices either, like the tariff mess, Musk’s triple-blindfolded piñata swings at crucial agencies and programs, or New Hampshire Republicans’ years of rich-guy tax cuts and repeals while non-wealthy property-tax payers get the shaft. It’s that the party’s foundational principles — tax cuts for the wealthy and smaller government to pay for those tax cuts — not only don’t do what Republicans argue they will (the enduring Reagan-era myth of trickle-down economics) but actually undermine the social safety net that’s meant to strengthen society at its foundation so we can build up from there.
You see, it’s one tiny slice of the American public that benefits from all these cuts, and it’s with them that the “savings” remain and multiply. Modern conservative economic philosophy, die-cast in fool’s gold nearly a half-century ago, makes sure that wealth in the richest country in the world flows in one direction and one direction only.
By design, the golden age promised to the masses — the Shangri-La of “Great Again” — is fused to a horizon just out of sight and forever out of reach.
Sometimes people write to me and say that I should take my “liberal” policies to Massachusetts where they belong. (Score one for Kelly!) I usually just thank them — sincerely — for reading the piece, because economically I’m on their side even if they don’t realize it. I don’t care much for party politics, and although Republican leaders are openly and brazenly against the public good, there have been enough times when Democrats have lost the trail.
I mean, there’s a reason Sen. Bernie Sanders felt the need to challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016. And Democrats haven’t done enough soul-searching about why Nancy Pelosi has waged a behind-the-scenes campaign against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party’s most effective communicators, over the years. And the left should worry that political fundraising in the wake of Citizens United has pushed congressional Democrats toward the center and congressional Republicans further right.
There is, however, no comparison between the parties when it comes to draining public services for the sole purpose of further enriching the wealthy. It is what Republicans live for.

In early 2024, I was assigned to the Ramsey County Probation Unit represented by Teamsters Local 320. The unit had fallen into disarray from a lack of leadership from both county administration and the previous union reps.
More than 200 Ramsey Count probation officers serve in several specialty units within the Community Corrections Department. The officers supervise over 11,000 adult and juvenile clients.
Probation and parole is at the intersection of rehabilitation and law enforcement. 
Probation and parole has been subject to increased regulatory and administrative changes in the past few years. More probation officers are required to wear bullet-resistant vests and body-worn cameras, even as officers are moving away from punitive models to more holistic community supervision.
These system-wide changes had resulted in internal tensions and poor morale within the officer corps, exacerbated by a lack of leadership from agency managers and policymakers.
The question posed to me as I took over the assignment was: Could union solidarity promote unit cohesion and establish internal leadership? 
The answer is “yes!” Union solidarity brought pride and purpose to probation officers in Ramsey County.
When I first assumed the role of business agent with the probation unit, I was viewed with skepticism and suspicion.
I immediately got to work and dealt with every issue — no matter how large or small — to build credibility with the officer corps. I soon discovered most issues were valid, and that labor/management power dynamics were weighted heavily towards management.
Probation officers are classified as “non-essential” status in state statute, unlike peace officers, correctional officers, county prosecutors and public safety dispatchers. This means probation officers have the right to strike over collective bargaining disputes.
Building strike capacity for probation officers proved less difficult than initially anticipated due to the desire of the officer corps to reclaim identity as vital professionals for public safety and rehabilitation. And, they demanded self-determination in defining their work and its impact.
Collective bargaining disputes can amplify issues and solve others, but usually do not result in transformational change. That type of change is hard work and takes time, dedication and compromise.
I knew long before we organized for a strike action that we would eventually get an agreement, and once we did so, momentum would wane. So we had to systematize lasting change within the final agreement.
We needed regular meet-and-confer sessions with county officials to elevate professional development discussions above the heads of department leaders, who failed to listen to officer concerns. 
We also needed a new officer training program that would place a lasting imprint from the officer corps on the institutional instruction and best practices of all future officers. 
As strike planning ensued, the county dug in. This only further solidified the officer corps’ resolve to strike if necessary.
In full transparency, I am a supporter of the liberal power structure in Ramsey County. It has been a positive force for working people, but just as the officers refused to be defined by others, I too refused to allow Teamsters in Ramsey County to be defined by prevailing systems.
The threat to strike was made public after four months of negotiations and mediation. By that time, the county started to buckle and brought us close to attaining a settlement on all items including wages, but the county proposed a two-tiered professional development system for senior officers and less senior officers. This move would narrow the path for junior officers to professionally develop into the senior classification.
For a negotiation predicated upon professional identity, this was a red line. 
The officer corps had voted by 99% to empower the union bargaining committee to call a strike if necessary. 
After we filed our strike notice, we held a massive rally at the Saint Paul courthouse to amplify our issues to the press and legal establishment. Officers chanted, “Teamsters don’t break.” After the rally the officers marched into the courthouse rotunda and continued chanting. 
The echo from the chanting in those halls could be heard outside the building onto the street.
The strike was averted when the county presented acceptable language on professional development. 
During this year-long process, there are a few important details to mention.

The union negotiating team was formed organically within the officer corps. It was self-organized by competent and committed union members who brought experience and expertise to the process.


Had it become necessary, the officers would have executed a successful strike against Ramsey County and won the support of the community.


Bureaucratic inertia has become a hindrance to union mobilization.

Overall, union organization brought pride and unity to the officer corps, which will wind up paying major dividends for Ramsey County taxpayers, who can count on a professional officer corps dedicated to service. 
A last point: Union probationary employees, who are usually young people of color, remain unprotected. In Ramsey County the probationary period for a new probation officer is one year. I have witnessed probationary employees make it to their last month or week of probation only to be let go just before the deadline. I have seen this not just with Ramsey County, but at the Board of Public Defense, and the University of Minnesota.
Unfortunately, I have had to tell union probationary employees that until their probationary period is complete, they are at-will and have the same rights as fast food or Walmart workers. .
We should demand a just cause threshold for any employment termination. You want to fire someone? You should need just cause.  
In Montana, no liberal bastion, just cause is required to discharge any employee.
When workers have a union in Montana, their union will enforce just cause. If the worker does not have a union, then they can seek out legal representation to enforce their rights. 
Minnesota should implement just cause as a fundamental right to empower workers in all 87 counties.

His executive order, issued Tuesday, directs the Department of Justice to challenge a huge swath of state laws and regulations. The order aims at measures that seek to cut carbon emissions, penalize energy companies and limit drilling permits. It also targets state-led lawsuits against fossil fuel companies over the damages caused by climate change.
Trump’s directive orders Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement” of any state laws related to climate change, including any that are seen as “burdening” the use of domestic energy resources. Such language could include state laws that mandate a transition to clean electricity sources.
The order specifically calls out “climate Superfund” policies in Vermont and New York, which require fossil fuel companies to pay for some of the damages caused by climate change. It also targets California’s cap-and-trade law, which places a limit on emissions through auctions of carbon credits.
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

While Trump’s order says such state policies are unconstitutional, climate-focused state leaders say his administration has no legal basis to unravel their efforts.
“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement from the U.S. Climate Alliance. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”
Hochul and Lujan Grisham co-chair the alliance, a coalition of 24 governors focused on reducing emissions.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Politico that the order is “toothless.”
“[Trump] has no authority on his own to nullify state laws,” he told the outlet.
But the order throws the might of the federal government into a sprawling legal battle over states’ authority to set climate policy and seek damages for disasters.
It could force states to face expensive litigation and years of legal uncertainty. Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and elsewhere have at times been hostile to environmental regulations. And it’s unclear whether the order will have a chilling effect on state efforts to craft more climate legislation.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)On the 69th day of the 69th legislative session, the Montana Senate adopted permanent rules for the chamber, more than three months after gaveling in to do business.
Less than 10 minutes into the start of the 2025 Legislature, the Senate was thrown into disarray when a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans blocked the GOP majority from passing the rules agreed upon by leadership. The dispute was mostly centered around committee assignments, which the coalition said diluted their ability to influence legislation.
The upper chamber has been operating under temporary rules ever since that first day, but finally reached an agreement this week on permanent rules.
“I think we’ve ironed out most of our differences,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, during a press availability with reporters ahead of the vote. “It’s nice to have a set of rules you can take in the next session, get a rule book.”
On the Senate floor Tuesday, McGillvray outlined the changes to the existing rules structure, which included removing an Executive Review Committee that drew ire early on, changing several procedural deadlines for the chamber, and giving the minority leader approval over minority appointments to committees.
The new rules also require the Senate president to receive “advance concurrence,” or approval, from the minority leader on the composition of conference committees — a select group of lawmakers assigned to iron out amendments to bills if both chambers do not agree on a final product — giving Democrats more power heading into the final weeks of the session when more bills are expected to end up workshopped that way. Previously, the minority leader only had to be consulted.

(Photo: Aire images/ Getty)Voters in South Portland may be asked on the November ballot to choose between natural grass and artificial turf at the high school athletics complex, but that project could face a hiccup from Augusta with a bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to pause synthetic field projects. 
The Maine Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee held a public hearing Wednesday for a proposal to put a three-year moratorium on installing and replacing artificial turf fields while the Department of Environmental Protection studies whether it is a risk to public health and the environment.
“I urge you to consider the safety of both our children, our environment and to support this legislation,” said Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) when presenting LD 1177.
While supporters of the bill echoed Gramlich’s concern for microplastics and other chemicals that could leach into waterways and human bodies, its opponents wondered why that sort of analysis can’t be done without a moratorium that could cause costly disruptions to efforts to build and maintain these fields.
Gramlich said current data and studies about the potential risks from artificial turf is scattered, so asking the department to vet and compile those findings would make it easier for Mainers to access reliable information to apprise decisions in their communities. 
South Portland resident Mary Linneman spoke of the time-consuming research she and others in her community have undertaken to advocate for a natural grass field. She supports LD 1177 because delegating that work to the state could make the process more efficient for other communities who may face similar questions. 
Gramlich also spoke of health risks to children who play on these surfaces, such as increased chance of dehydration since artificial turf can get hotter than regular grass. Though, there is also evidence that natural grass could pose a greater risk of concussions, especially while playing football.  
A senior at Mount View High School in Thorndike told the committee he experiences more knee and hip pain after playing soccer on a turf field, when sharing the reasons why he is in support of the bill. 
Other proponents of the bill raised concerns about the toxic chemicals found in artificial turf including phthalates, which have been known to increase risks of cancer, asthma and other negative health outcomes. There was also discussion about the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, in the artificial turf; however, fields with intentionally added PFAS will already be banned in the coming years under current state law.
Despite industry improvements to eliminate PFAS and move away from using recycled rubber in these fields, testing may not capture all types of forever chemicals, said Sarah Woodbury, vice president of policy and advocacy for Defend Our Health. At the same time, she said the organic materials to replace the rubber are often still treated with chemicals for durability.
Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), a cosponsor of the bill, also expressed worries about these fields ending up in landfills when Maine is already facing a solid waste “crisis.” Turf fields generally need to be replaced every 10 years. 
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim testified neither for nor against the bill. She said there are logical questions around using turf, but certain language in the bill should be clarified and the department would need more resources to complete the proposed work. 
Dennis Walton, athletic director for Biddeford Schools, argued it violates the principle of local control and fails to recognize the environmental hazards such as pesticides, mowing and high water usage needed to maintain natural fields. 
Superintendent Jeffrey Porter also opposed the bill because MSAD 51 is in the process of installing a turf field for the Cumberland-North Yarmouth district after a 20-person committee spent three months researching and deciding on a PFAS-free product to replace its current grass field that is in poor condition. 
Athletics facilities at the University of Maine are undergoing overdue maintenance, including the addition of artificial turf fields, said Samantha Warren, chief external and governmental affairs officer, testifying against the bill. She said the university contracted with manufacturers whose products align with the state’s current PFAS regulations, but this proposal would “move those goalposts” and cost the university more money to redesign the project. 
Additionally, artificial turf is important when recruiting students to play at the state’s only Division I school, Warren said.
While turf is used at many collegiate facilities across the country, professional athletes have come out against its use including the NFL Players Association and the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team. 
Mayor Mark Dion said Portland has invested in artificial turf to provide safe, accessible and durable athletic spaces throughout the city. Rather than implementing a moratorium, Dion suggested in his written testimony that the state should collaborate with municipalities while trying to better understand the environmental impacts.

Lieske and Roach host a show called “Minnesota Liberty Network.” On Monday, the two discussed the state Senate floor vote on a resolution condemning President Donald Trump’s blanket pardon of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6. insurrection. Lieske was absent for the vote, and all 22 of the Republicans present voted against the resolution.
“If I would have been there, probably would have ended up voting no. I think that was such a stupid resolution,” Lieske said on the podcast. 
Roach then launched into an explanation of why he believes the Jan. 6. was a “hoax.” 
“You had people that were actors that were wearing the uniform of the Trump supporter that made it look like they were there to support Donald Trump,” Roach said. 
MAGA supporters at the time were upset with mask mandates, Roach said, arguing that because some insurrectionists were wearing masks, “those were not real, true MAGA Donald Trump conservative supporters.”
As evidence for the “hoax” hypothesis, Roach cited the timing of the Capitol breach — while Congress was debating whether to certify the election results in Arizona, which Joe Biden won — and floor speeches made by members of Congress immediately after the riot, all using the word “insurrection.” 
“It was all prepared,” Lieske said. 
“I had never heard the term insurrection in my life until that day,” Roach said. 
He continued: “So you’re telling me you were scared for your life, you were in the basement calling your family, but you were rewriting a new speech? I call bullshit.”
Around 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the insurrection, and more than 1,500 people were charged with crimes ranging from disorderly conduct to carrying a weapon on Capitol grounds and assaulting a law enforcement officer. More than 1,000 pleaded guilty, with 281 cases going to trial. 
Among those convicted were 14 members of the far-right organizations Proud Boys and Oath Keepers; members of a Telegram group chat called “PATRIOTS 45 MAGA Gang” who brought tactical gear to the Capitol to “violently remove traitors”; and numerous people who posted on their personal social media accounts or livestreamed while breaching the Capitol.
The U.S. Capitol Police chief testified Tuesday that Trump’s pardons had negative repercussions on morale within the department and for police across the country.

Laura Kelly signs pair of campaign finance bills in addition to legislation on municipal government whistleblowers and fees assessed on KORA requests.,"SenSen. Tim Shallenburger, R-Baxter Springs, welcomed Gov. Laura Kelly's signature on a bill designed to shield municipal government employees in Kansas who step forward as whistleblowers to expose wrongdoing, unlawful behavior or misappropriation of funds. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill doubling campaign contribution limits to statewide and legislative candidates and a separate bill establishing new boundaries for the state commission responsible for enforcing campaign finance law.
The content of House Bill 2054 and House Bill 2206 was a point of contention at the Capitol because the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission — renamed the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission by the legislation — had launched a controversial and politically sensitive investigation of Republican officials, consultants and activists for potentially coordinating campaign cash in ways contrary to state law.
The final version of HB 2054, which passed the House on a vote of 72-52 and the Senate by a margin of 26-14, increased aggregate limits for donations in primary and general elections from $2,000 to $4,000 for candidates for statewide office, including governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, insurance commissioner and state treasurer.
Donations to candidates for Kansas House, district court judge, district attorney and local offices in jurisdictions of less than 50,000 people were doubled to $1,000 from the current cap of $500. In contests for Kansas Senate, the state Board of Education as well as local office candidates in positions with a population greater than 50,000, the limit also doubled to $2,000 from $1,000.
The bill raised the amount of cash a person could donate to a candidate or candidate committee for any primary or general election from $100 to $200.
In addition, the law eliminated limits on political party committees making donations to candidates in general elections. The bill declared expenditures by a Republican or Democratic committee in support of a candidate wouldn’t be counted as contributions. The law raised to $35,000 per calendar year how much a person could give to a state party committee and political committee of the House and Senate.
The governor also signed HB 2206, which was development to constrain the state commission tasked with regulating Kansas campaign-finance law.
This bill created a new definition for “cooperation or consent” in relation to express advocacy expenditures. For example, it would exclude a candidate’s or political party’s expenditures in response to inquiries about positions on legislative issues or the endorsement of a candidate.
This legislation also changed the way Kansas viewed contributions given in the name of another person. The bill raised the limit from $10 to $50 the amount political contribution an individual could accept without knowing the identity of the donor.
 Municipal whistleblower
Meanwhile, Kelly signed House Bill 2160 to establish the Municipal Employee Whistleblower Act. It extended legal protection for municipal employees who reported or revealed unlawful or dangerous conduct.
“This bipartisan bill will enhance transparency and accountability in local government, ensuring that municipal employees can report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation,” Kelly said. “Protecting whistleblowers is vital for maintaining public trust, safeguarding taxpayer resources, and promoting ethical governance.”
Historically, whistleblower protections had been limited to state and federal employees and were aimed at protecting people who reported misconduct or corruption from retaliatory actions. The bill sought to distinguish whistleblowers from disgruntled employers unhappy with lawful decisions.
“Municipal employees don’t have to fear reprisal any more for exposing wrongdoing, unlawful behavior, or misappropriation of funds,” said Sen. Tim Shallenburger, a Republican from Baxter Springs. “This piece of legislation gives the necessary protection to those, who in good faith, bring to light what the government wants to keep in the dark.”
The governor signed House Bill 2134 to limit fees charged by a public agency in response to Kansas Open Records Act requests and allowed a person requesting a record to appeal a fee’s reasonableness to the secretary of the Kansas Department of Administration if the material in question was linked to the executive branch.
In addition, the bill altered state law so a public agency wouldn’t be required to disclose closed investigations of violations of civil law or administrative regulations when no violation was found. In addition, the list of exempted records was expanded to include material viewed as obscene.
Kelly signed House Bill 2149 to modernize state law on installation of solar panels on a home or business. She endorsed Senate Bill 114 to authorize nonpublic and virtual school students to take part in public school activities.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/P4060215-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 15:14:16.495208

Bingham will replace Bryan Slone, who earlier had announced his departure from the chamber following seven years in that position. Slone said he planned to pursue other possibilities in Nebraska, including a possible political bid, though he didn’t provide details.
Slone, in a statement, said he was pleased about Bingham’s appointment. He said Bingham’s connections across the country and experience in urban and rural business development make him a great choice to continue the chamber’s work.
Joel Russell, chamber chair, said: “Todd is a wonderful addition to the Nebraska Chamber, bringing backgrounds in public policy and manufacturing, two of the chamber’s largest endeavors.” 
Bingham comes with 30 years of experience as a registered lobbyist. He has been an advocate for business and industry, specializing in governmental and regulatory affairs.
According to a chamber news statement, Bingham has served as national chair of the Council of State Manufacturing Associations and is a current board member of the National Association of Manufacturers.
He has served on various state boards and councils, including the Utah Employers Council and an OSHA advisory board, and has contributed to such groups as the Utah Labor Commission’s Workers’ Compensation Advisory Council.

(Photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY — Differing ideas of how to create residential setbacks for wind turbines have advanced through the Oklahoma House and Senate, but the chambers have yet to find a compromise on bill language. 
The Senate bill would create statewide setbacks a quarter of a nautical mile, which is slightly more than a quarter of a mile, from residential dwellings and nonparticipating properties, but allows property owners to waive these setbacks. The House version has larger setbacks and would not affect the whole state, but is targeted by population density in counties. 
Rep. Brad Boles, R-Marlow, asked the House Energy Committee to move the Senate version forward to continue conversations with the opposite chamber. 
“What I will say about Senate Bill 2 is it’s not our final language, we still are in negotiation with the Senate,” he said. “They have our bill that we passed, which we’re working with them on that language as well trying to get a compromise between both chambers. I will say on record, we do not have a compromise between both chambers at this point.” 
The continued legislative disagreement over bill details comes as pressure mounts on lawmakers to regulate one of the state’s most prominent renewable energy industry. 
The House sent its own proposed regulations version to the Senate, which would require turbines to be at least 1.5 times the tower’s height from nonparticipating properties and half a nautical mile from occupied buildings. County commissioners could refer the issue to a vote of county residents under this plan. 
The House version has been referred to the Senate Energy Committee, but has not been heard yet as of Wednesday. 
Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he and Boles have visited with Senate leaders and was supportive of moving the bill out of a House committee to push the conversation forward. 
“This bill does have some things we need to improve about it. I much prefer the House version of the bill,” he said. “They did commit to giving a hearing to the House version of this legislation, but Rep. Boles and I did commit to doing what we could to help keep this bill alive through the process so we can continue to have a vehicle and then make changes as necessary.”
Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, who was one of the four House committee members to vote against the Senate’s plan, said he didn’t like that the House version would not affect the whole state, but didn’t like the length of the Senate’s setbacks. 
Rep. Jared Deck, D-Norman, who voted against the plan, said the legislation creating these setbacks miss out on the opportunity to create wealth for landowners. He compared wind energy to mineral rights which have been “wealth building multi-generationally for families around the state.” 
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, has previously said the setback proposed by the Senate is “more rational.” He said the proposed House setbacks “pretty well bans the industry.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Discussion of legislation to afford the Wabanaki Nations more authority over their land revealed that Gov. Janet Mills does not support the change, presenting a steep path for a plan that otherwise has bipartisan support. 
After not testifying during the public hearing last week, the governor’s counsel, Jerry Reid, told the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that Mills’ concerns stem from the inability to predict the future needs of state government, an issue also raised in written testimony from the Maine Department of Transportation, which was made available after the hearing. 
When pressed by committee members, Reid said he doesn’t have a specific example of an infrastructure project that would warrant seizing tribal land but that, “We need to write the law mindful for potential for problems.” 
While Reid and Wabanaki leaders noted that progress has and continues to be made to improve the relationship between the state and Wabanaki Nations, Reid added, “the fact that we have such a good relationship right now might not always be true.”
The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws.
The 1834 federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress. However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation.

This is the act that has overall resulted in the Tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations. So far, sweeping changes to the act have failed due to opposition from Mills, but the governor, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted adjustments, including expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes last year. 
The legislation being considered this session, LD 958, would amend the Settlement Act to prohibit the state from exercising eminent domain on trust and reservation land, which is protected under federal law, though fee land — or private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to the state taking.
The bill would also amend the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act to make this change for the Mi’kmaq Nation, which wasn’t included in the Settlement Act.
On Tuesday, the Taxation Committee unanimously voted in favor of a bill to ensure equal tax treatment among all of the Wabanaki Nations, which Mills supports. LD 982 would provide the Mi’kmaq Nation the same rights to sales tax revenue on its land that the other three tribes of the Wabanaki Nations were granted in 2022 through an amendment to the Settlement Act.
State hasn’t exercised this authority in decades, but argues it’s necessary
The state hasn’t exercised eminent domain over tribal lands since the Settlement Act. However, testimony from Wabanaki leaders and state government officials underscore that it is a possibility. 
In its testimony, MDOT raised concern about the uncertainty over the future location of tribal trust land, which is land the federal government holds the legal title of on behalf of a tribe. 
Bipartisan lawmakers, Wabanaki leaders propose next change to Settlement Act

Each of the Wabanaki Nations are eligible to acquire up to 150,000 acres of trust land in specific areas identified in the Settlement Act. Several tribes have already acquired most of that. 
“It is impossible to know how the eventual location of these lands could impact public transportation needs in coming years, and certainly not decades into the future,” wrote Meghan Russo, director of government affairs at MDOT.
Reid said the governor shares that concern. While noting that Mills doesn’t like the concept of eminent domain, he said, “it’s one of those things that when you need it, it suddenly is critically important and it’s an essential tool that government needs in order to be able to deliver on the needs of modern society.”
The governor believes the state needs to be mindful of the interests of the 1.4 million non-tribal Maine citizens as well, Reid said, to which Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana questioned whether the relatively small acreage the tribes could acquire would make a sizable impact on the state’s ability to do so. 
“We don’t know,” Reid said, “but it could be.” 
While arguing for the state’s right to eminent domain over tribal land, Reid emphasized the state’s record in the past several decades of negotiating with the Tribes rather than exercising that authority, an apparent contradiction pointed out by lawmakers.
“If the state is saying that they won’t do this and they don’t need to and they would never be bad neighbors like that, then ask the state, why can’t they abide by this law?” questioned the bill sponsor, House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor). “Then put it into statute that they won’t do that, because if you need some land or access to some land for a project or something, then go to them and make a deal and buy it.”
Faulkingham also pushed back on what he described as a false notion of trust land being the “boogie man,” given the limited acreage permitted to the Tribes.  
While eminent domain of tribal land hasn’t been used recently, Maine’s proposal to build an offshore wind port, although effectively stalled at the moment, has given the Wabanaki Nations cause for concern. 
Reiterating worry shared by William Nicholas, chief of the Passamoquoddy Tribe at Indian Township, during the bill hearing, Passamaquoddy attorney Corey Hinton said on Wednesday that the state did not appropriately involve the Wabanaki Nations in planning discussions, particularly when considering Estes Head in Eastport as a possible location. 
The more distant past should also not be dismissed, Hinton added. 
“The State of Maine has numerous times relied on the taking of tribal lands and resources to promote industrialization and infrastructure development,” Hinton said. “It’s a simple fact of the history of Maine.” 
A related line of questioning revealed the persistent tension around tribal sovereignty. 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said, for him, this bill is easy: the state of Maine can’t take another government’s land. 
“I fundamentally think of our relationship with the tribes as a government to government relationship,” Lee said. 










The State of Maine has numerous times relied on the taking of tribal lands and resources to promote industrialization and infrastructure development. It's a simple fact of the history of Maine.

“We can’t take a part of New Hampshire. We can’t take a part of Greenland or Panama,” Lee added, referring to President Donald Trump’s desires to do so, a comment that received some laughs from other committee members.
Reid argued that Lee’s view is overly simplistic since the federal government has the authority of eminent domain. 
An argument about relative permanence 
The Mills administration, lawmakers and tribes are also at odds regarding whether changes to the Settlement Act are permanent. 
“An amendment to the main implementing act is, for all intents and purposes, a permanent change in the law,” Reid said. “It’s the only context in which you all can bind future legislatures. It is a more profound commitment than an amendment to the state constitution, which can be undone by the will of the Maine voters.” 
Russo with MDOT also made the same point in written testimony, that the Legislature cannot unilaterally repeal or amend the new language if issues arise once implemented. 
Federal law authorizes the Maine Legislature to make changes to the Settlement Act and Mi’kmaq Restoration Act but only with the consent of the affected Tribes.
Dana, the representative for the Passamaquoddy Tribe, asked Reid how he squared that idea of permanence with the fact that the Legislature is currently with this bill deciding whether to amend the Settlement Act, and has made changes in the recent past. 
“That’s one of the biggest things that you and your office really fight against with the Tribes, yet we have the ability to make those changes as of right now, and why can’t we do those in the future?” Dana questioned. 
Mills’ philosophy when it comes to the Settlement Act has been to ensure any changes and consequences are understood by all parties, Reid said, adding that the consequences are too uncertain for the governor in this instance.  
“I take your point that it’s theoretically possible that, with the consent of the Tribes, this amendment could be repealed,” Reid said, “but presumably, if there comes a point when there’s a contentious issue involving the use of eminent domain in the future the affected Tribe wouldn’t be in a position to agree to repeal this law because they wouldn’t be on the same page as the state.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed 41 more bills into law Tuesday, including several to boost New Mexico’s ability to install solar panels in small communities and allow utilities to seek rate changes for technology to improve electricity transmission. 
She has until April 11 to sign or veto legislation.
House Bill 128 establishes a $20 million dollar fund to provide grants for solar energy and battery storage for tribal, rural and low-income schools, municipalities and counties. 
“This fund is an investment in our infrastructure, our economy, and our future,” Sen. Harold Pope (D-Albuquerque) one of the bill’s sponsors, said in a statement. “It fills crucial funding gaps for rural and underserved areas, ensuring that all communities — no matter their zip code — can implement solar projects that cut energy costs, lower emissions, and enhance our resilience during fires, blackouts, and intense storms. I’m proud that we passed it.”
House Bill 93 will allow larger electric utilities to incorporate advanced grid technology projects into their grid modernization plans, and incorporate those plans into the ratemaking process before the Public Regulation Commission.
Co-sponsor Kristina Ortez (D-Taos) told Source the alternative: building more transmission lines can be “100 times to 1,000 times more expensive” than using technologies that boost lines capacity to carry more electricity, and state law allows electricity companies to pass on those costs to customers.
“Advanced grid technologies are way cheaper for ratepayers,” Ortez said. “These utilities now have incentives to try to make their existing lines more efficient rather than building a whole new one.”
HB93 is limited to investor-owned utilities, such as Public Service Company of New Mexico Xcel Energy and El Paso Electric, and does not impact smaller electric cooperatives, she noted.
The governor also signed : House Bill 10, which establishes a new enforcement division under the state’s Regulation and Licensing Bureau to enforce state cannabis laws; House Bill 63, which proposes changes to the public school funding formula to generate more money for low-income, English-language learning students and students in seventh through 12th grades; andSenate Bill 19, which requires that members of university governing boards undergo 10 hours of training on ethics, student services and best practices. 
Four of the bills she enacted related to water treatment for ongoing climate impacts, addressing so-called “forever chemicals” contamination and pollution control.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Democrats in Colorado intend to expand existing protections for immigrants in Colorado who lack permanent legal status as the Trump administration continues its mass deportation efforts.
Senate Bill 25-276 passed its first legislative committee on a party-line vote Tuesday night. It needs to clear the Senate Appropriations Committee before getting a full debate on the chamber floor.
“We’ve seen the Trump administration wield attacks against immigrants, regardless of their immigration status, with increasing frequency and with less and less regard for due process,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, told supporters and journalists ahead of the committee hearing.
“This bill creates clarity amidst the chaos, confusion and uncertainty that our communities are facing,” she said.

Gonzales is running the bill alongside Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat, and Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat.
It comes in the wake of immigration raids in the Denver metro area and the arrest of immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra outside her work in March. Colorado university students have had their visas revoked, following a national push by the Trump administration to target students who have protested against Israel’s war on Gaza and other contentious issues.
A CBS 60 Minutes report recently found that of the over 200 people that federal authorities transported to a prison in El Salvador, only about 22% have a criminal history in the United States, mostly for non-violent crimes. Some of the people detained in Colorado also had no criminal record, as reported by Colorado Public Radio.
“What we know about the administration’s actions thus far — and good luck trying to find the truth right because it’s a new thing every day — they’re not targeted just to people who’ve committed offenses, despite what they say. They put fear into a broader universe of people,” Weissman said.
Builds on previous laws
Colorado has existing laws that restrict local law enforcement cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, prohibiting them from arresting a person on behalf of immigration authorities or holding them in jail past their release time so ICE can pick them up. SB-276 would further clarify that local law enforcement cannot delay a person’s release for an immigration enforcement operation. It would also restrict ICE from physical access to non-public spaces in a jail without a warrant.
“When a person posts bond, they need to be released. That’s it. That’s how we roll in the United States of America. And so when those jails are holding people for up to six hours to facilitate ICE apprehension, the jail and the county commissioners for that jail are looking at a Fourth Amendment lawsuit,” immigration lawyer Hans Meyer said. “This is a way for us to make sure that those lines are clear. I don’t like ICE, but ICE can do their job as long as they’re doing their job lawfully.”
State agencies are not allowed to share personally-identifying information — data that is not publicly available such as a birthday, tax identification number, vehicle registration information or fingerprints — with immigration authorities. The bill would extend that prohibition to local governments.
It would also repeal requirements that a person without permanent legal status submit an affidavit saying they intend to, or already have, applied for status when seeking in-state tuition at a public university in the state or for a driver’s license.
“These affidavits serve no constructive purpose, no public benefit, all while collecting sensitive data and private information that potentially exposes individuals to constitutional rights violations,” Velasco said.
Additionally, the bill would prevent federal immigration officers from accessing non-public spaces in schools, hospitals and child care centers without a warrant. Many supporters testified on Tuesday that fear of detention and deportation has created a chilling effect in the immigrant community, creating fear around attending school and seeking medical care.
The bill would also allow immigrants to ask a court to vacate a guilty plea for some additional misdemeanors not currently allowed under law, traffic violations and petty offenses if they weren’t advised by their lawyers of immigration consequences of that plea.
Guilty pleas can make it nearly impossible for immigrants to obtain legal status, such as a green card and eventually apply for citizenship. Aubrey Lesso said her husband’s marijuana conviction from a decade ago prevented him from getting permanent residence after their marriage.
“My husband wasn’t advised of the immigration consequences of this petty offense, so he pleaded guilty and, as he was a minor, all he needed to do was pay a fine instead of going to more court dates,” she said. “We have spent almost four years trying to clean up my husband’s record, but he still doesn’t have a pathway to status.”
That has created a ripple effect, she said, because her husband can’t get a Social Security number or work authorization.
“I always fear that my husband will be detained by ICE, leaving me and my son alone,” she said.
Republicans vote against bill
The bill would set civil penalties, up to $50,000, for violations that would go to the state’s Immigrant Legal Defense Fund. The Colorado Municipal League asked for an amendment Tuesday to exempt local government employees from that liability.
The testimony on Tuesday was almost entirely in support of the bill, including from immigrant rights groups, education advocacy organizations, and groups like the ACLU of Colorado.
Three organizations are officially registered in opposition to the bill: the town of Castle Rock, Strong Advocates For Enforcement in Colorado, or SAFE Colorado, and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police.
“This bill is not about civil rights, as its supporters claim. It is about shielding criminal illegal aliens under the guise of virtue signaling,” said John Fabbricatore, a former ICE regional director and leader of SAFE Colorado.
Republican Sens. Rod Pelton of Cheyenne Wells and Byron Pelton of Sterling voted against the bill in committee, a likely foreshadow to universal Republican opposition in the Senate.
Democrats hold majorities in both the Senate and House and do not need Republican votes to pass legislation. The bill now heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

<p>SPRINGFIELD — Illinois has been at the forefront of the data center boom, but state lawmakers are working to gauge and mitigate the impact these centers have on climate and energy consumption.</p>

<p>Powering these data centers is costly, consuming large amounts of water and energy. The growth of this business has prompted concerns about the impact on the environment and the electricity grid, including rising costs for rate-paying consumers.</p>
<p>State Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Public Utilities, has filed legislation that aims to gather data on the industry to determine the impact on energy and water usage and prevent them from putting too much strain on Illinois' power grids.</p>

<p>Across the U.S., utilities and grid operators are worried by the increased demand of electricity needed for data centers, and some have proposed delaying the closure of fossil fuel plants to support that demand, setting back environmental goals.</p>
<p>A January <a href=""https://frontiergroup.org/resources/big-data-centers-big-problems/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">study by Frontier Group</a>, a coalition of environmental and consumer groups, found at least 17 units at seven fossil fuel plants have seen their planned closures delayed — or are at risk of being delayed — due in part to increased demand from data centers. Most of it is happening in Virginia, where “Data Center Alley” is located, and nearby Maryland and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Stadelman cited similar environmental concerns about Illinois’ goals under the 2021 <a href=""https://epa.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/epa/topics/ceja/documents/102-0662.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA)</a>, which requires the state to shift to 100% clean energy by 2050. He worries that indiscriminate expansion of data centers could hamper Illinois’ ability to meet that deadline.</p>
<p>""When we passed CEJA, no one anticipated the impact of data centers,” Stadelman said. ""That is going to have an impact on our ability to meet our energy demands with these data centers.”</p>
<p>The proposal also calls for the agency to suggest legislative solutions “to mitigate any negative impacts of data centers on rate-paying customers.”</p>
<p>But SB 2181 has not yet received a hearing — or any co-sponsors — despite agreement from fellow state Sen. Laura Ellman, D-Naperville, that data centers’ resource usage could become a problem for Illinois.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>""Illinois has a wealth of power and water, but we have to be good stewards of that wealth,"" said Ellman, who chairs the Senate Environment and Conservation committee. ""One fear I have is that this increased demand from data centers will delay the closure of fossil fuel plants, much like they did in Virginia and Maryland.""</p></blockquote>
<p>Trying to regulate the business, though, could be “somewhat tricky,” according to Laurance Lewis, senior advisor at Metro Edge Development Partners, a Chicago commercial real estate firm focused on data center development.</p>
<p>All data centers are not the same, Lewis pointed out. There are both “hyperscalers” and “colocation” centers. Hyperscaler data centers are usually owned and operated by one company, such as tech giants like Google or Amazon. Colocation centers, on the other hand, rent out space to smaller companies, which could make it difficult to collect data on resource usage.</p>
<p>“If you are a data center landlord of a retail colocation facility, you have multiple tenants. Some of their energy and water consumption may not be metered precisely” Lewis said, noting that poorly crafted legislation could be “unduly burdensome.”</p>
<p><a href=""https://cee.illinois.edu/news/AIs-Challenging-Waters"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">An October study</a> published by the Center for Secure Water at the University of Illinois found that hyperscalers can use up to 550,000 gallons of water per day, while smaller data centers can consume up to 18,000 gallons per day.</p>
<p>However, Lewis argued that many critiques on water consumption are “overblown,” claiming the data center industry is “self-regulating” and trying to find solutions, “such as a closed-loop water system that does not require millions of gallons of water.”</p>
<p>Recently, the need for such large expenditures of resources by U.S. data centers has been called into question with the emergence of new Chinese AI large language model “Deepseek,” which reportedly consumes less water and power than Open AI and other competitors.</p>
<p>Cushman and Wakefield, a global real estate services firm with a Chicago office, assesses that Chicago’s metro area currently hosts <a href=""https://cushwake.cld.bz/Americas-Data-Center-H2-2024-Update/10/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">1.2 gigawatts of operational capacity</a>, with 169 megawatts under construction and about 2.6 gigawatts already planned in upcoming years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a comprehensive study to estimate data centers' impact on the electricity grid is difficult to find. The rapid boom of data centers in recent years means their impact is still up for interpretation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, data centers are multiplying. The <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/03/23/illinois-data-centers-clean-energy/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chicago Tribune reported</a> last month that a new data center in Minooka, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, could be opened by California-based Equinix Inc. by 2034. The new structure, the Tribune reported, will need 3 million gallons of water per day and 700 megawatts of power.</p>
<h3>Weighing the economic benefits</h3>
<p>As in many other municipalities, local leaders and residents are weighing the economic benefits of the project — including new jobs and tax revenue — against possible environmental tradeoffs. But absent state action like the data collection called for in Stadelman’s bill, those environmental factors are currently difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>Andrew Chien, director and founder of the Center for Unstoppable Computing at the University of Chicago, believes that in the meantime, ""planning is always important.""</p>
<p>“In Virginia, for example, they are building fossil fuel generators alongside renewables because they did not have an adequate plan to support the demand of power data centers required through renewable energy,"" said Chien, a professor at the University.</p>
<p>But he pointed out that Illinois has a different mix of energy sources than Virginia, owing to the state’s 11 reactors at six nuclear plants — <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/us-nuclear-industry.php#:~:text=Illinois%20has%20more%20reactors%20than,about%2011%2C582%20megawatts%20(MW)."" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the most of any state</a> — “and ample wind and solar resources.”</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“I think the right way to deal with this is to build capacity with those clean energy resources to be prepared for the growth in data centers,” Chien said. “If we are prepared, we would not only attract jobs and investments. We would also do so in a way that does not increase carbon emissions.""</p></blockquote>
<p>On this note, Lewis agrees with Chien: Illinois is different from other states, as Illinois’ energy market deregulated nearly 30 years ago, opening it up “to the entire country to procure energy,” he said.</p>
<p>“Going back to fossil fuels is less likely to happen in Illinois than in a regulated state,” Lewis said. “There are solar projects in DeKalb, for example, some wind projects and new technology coming in the market like hydrogen fuel cells and Dairy Renewable Natural Gas. There is a general sense that fossil fuel can only take us so far.”</p>
<p>While the coexistence of technological innovation amid the shift towards renewable energy has proved problematic in other parts of the country, Illinois legislators think it is still early enough to tackle this issue.</p>
<p>Rep. Carol Ammons, D-Urbana, chair of the House Energy and Environment committee, said it’s “critical” for state policy to “achieve this balance” allowing those two sectors cohabitate.</p>
<blockquote class=""pullquote align-center""><p>“I think it is a false choice to put our environment and innovation against each other, it should not have to conflict."" she said. ""We need to protect our environment and ensure that up-and-coming technology develops sustainably. We need to regulate the industry to ensure technology does not pollute our communities while allowing new fields to emerge and provide opportunities.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But environmental concerns are not the only possible pitfall for data centers. Another concern is their impact on energy customers, who could see the cost of their rates spike in upcoming years. Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Chicago-based consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board, said she worries that Illinois’ energy capacity may be monopolized by data centers in the near future.</p>
<p>""In Illinois, we have put together solutions to ensure adequate energy supply for citizens through ratepayer support for nuclear power plants,” Moskowitz said, referring to fees approved by the General Assembly in the last decade that support the continued operations of nuclear plants in the northern half of the state as a bridge to expanding more renewable energy.</p>
<p>“Those supports do not expire for a couple of years, but now is the time to start working on strategies to ensure that the power generation that citizens need is not all gobbled up by these single, powerful customers.”</p>
<p>Moskowitz warned that the growth of data centers could cause higher prices for energy for consumers and cautioned that “the entities that control the information about data centers are the entities that benefit the most from inflating demand projections.”</p>
<p>“Suppose those data companies can outbid everyday ratepayers for electricity generation,” she said. “In that case, that is removed from the overall markets and exacerbates real or perceived energy supply shortages that drive up market prices.""</p>

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois has been at the forefront of the data center boom, but state lawmakers are working to gauge and mitigate the impact these centers have on climate and energy consumption.

In the last two decades, data centers have multiplied due to increased demand for cloud computing, information storage and data processing. However, data centers now also serve AI and cryptocurrency mining, which puts new digital coins into circulation and enters transactions on the blockchain.

Powering these data centers is costly, consuming large amounts of water and energy. The growth of this business has prompted concerns about the impact on the environment and the electricity grid, including rising costs for rate-paying consumers.

State Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Public Utilities, has filed legislation that aims to gather data on the industry to determine the impact on energy and water usage and prevent them from putting too much strain on Illinois' power grids.

“As data centers continue to multiply, they are putting an incredible strain on the grid,” he said. “And this legislation is trying to ensure that residents are not bearing the rise of this energy cost caused by the booming of this industry.”

Under Stadelman’s Senate Bill 2181, companies that operate data centers in Illinois would need to report their annual water and energy consumption to the Illinois Power Agency beginning next spring under threat of $10,000 fines for non-compliance. The IPA would then synthesize the data into annual reports to answer the question of whether residential ratepayers in Illinois are, in effect, subsidizing data centers, along with the environmental impacts of the industry.

It heads to the floor.,"Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, answers committee questions about the delta-8 regulatory bill he is sponsoring on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation regulating a marijuana-like drug already available throughout Indiana inched closer to reality Wednesday, after clearing its third committee vote — and another round of revisions — in the House. It next heads to the chamber’s floor.
Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol — the major psychoactive component in marijuana — remains illegal in Indiana. But the delta-8 THC business is booming.
Attempts to regulate the isomer have failed repeatedly, typically in the Senate. But when Senate Bill 478 crossed out of that chamber, House lawmakers got to work.
Committees focused on commerce and finance vetted the measure, making substantive changes each time. On Wednesday, the House Courts and Criminal Code Committee got its turn, approving another set of edits intended to curry Senate support and avoid potentially messy negotiations.
“I certainly am one that thinks that the status quo is unacceptable,” Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, told the committee. “And so, we need to get this bill in a position where we can get a concurrence over in the Senate.”
Senate Bill 478 sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements for the hemp-derived products. The Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission would gain regulatory power over the industry.

A major amendment, taken by consent on Wednesday, sets a cap on the number of retail permits at 9,400. Chris Serrack, the commission’s deputy director, said that’s an estimate of how many retailers carry the products today — about 75% of the current 12,000 tobacco certificate holders. The calculation doesn’t include alcoholic beverage permittees with on-premise-only services, he said.
The first-come, first-serve system would function in contrast to the population-based model governing alcohol permits. Doing that for delta-8 would be “burdensome,” per Serrack, because it requires auctions and records-keeping.
Several committee members feared those factors combined would lock businesses already selling the products out of the industry.
The amended legislation also blocks the commission from issuing permits to grocery stores larger than 2,500 square feet or to any drug stores. It limits eligibility to convenience stores, and to current alcoholic beverage permittees for on-premise consumption.
When asked why, Teshka told the committee, “Again, … my interest here is that we get a concurrence in the Senate.”
The rationale, he continued, “is that, you know, we want to limit the proliferation of these products. So, where they’re being sold now is where we should keep them.”
Another provision would require permit-holders to keep all craft hemp invoices and make them available for commission inspection. Other additions offer punishments for products “adulterated” with illegal substances and bans driving under the influence of any craft hemp products.
The amendment also removed tax language added last week by the House Ways and Means Committee. Teshka said the provision would get moved elsewhere because new taxes must go in House-originated legislation.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, accentuated the rare third round of committee vetting while questioning Serrack about the new penalties.
  Rep. Wendy McNamara leads a committee hearing on Wednesday, March 19, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“I had a quick question on the penalties, since I guess that’s what this committee is supposed to worry about the most,” Pierce quipped. “Were you involved in figuring out what the penalty should be?”
Serrack affirmed his agency’s involvement, and that the penalties were essentially mirrored from existing alcohol law.
Earlier, Teshka indicated a third hearing wasn’t always the plan.
“I appreciate you all. I know we’re getting to the end (of the legislative session) and we put an extra meeting on your calendar that wasn’t there before,” he told lawmakers, one day before the Thursday committee hearing deadline.
Rep. Wendy McNamara told the Capital Chronicle that Senate Bill 478 was recommitted to her committee because it would create a new penalty structure. She said any new felonies typically come her way.
The committee advanced the legislation on a 9-3 tally. Republicans were all three “no” votes.
It heads to the House floor for potential further amendments, then a final vote. If the House’s numerous changes don’t earn a Senate concurrence, representation from each chamber would have to negotiate a final version.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Colorado health officials warned Tuesday that measles may be spreading undetected in Colorado following the confirmation of the state’s third case this year in an Archuleta County resident.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s warning comes after two previous measles cases in Pueblo and Denver. Unlike in those two cases, the Archuleta County resident, an adult whose vaccination status has not been confirmed, did not recently travel internationally.
“This case does not appear to be linked to the other cases reported in Colorado and the individual did not travel outside of Colorado, which leaves open the possibility of community transmission,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “We urge Coloradans to monitor for symptoms if they may have been exposed, and to make sure they are up to date on their (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations.”



Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine provide about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado has not had three measles cases confirmed in the same calendar year in at least 12 years, according to state data.
The infections come amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas and neighboring states that have caused at least two deaths of unvaccinated children. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. While state law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, it allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
CDPHE officials say people may have been exposed to measles at the Wolf Creek Ski Area and Resort between March 28 and 30; the Pagosa Springs City Market on March 31; and the Pagosa Medical Group clinic at 27B Talisman Dr. on March 31 and April 2. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

The Hamilton County Principals Association represents principals in 79 public schools in the Chattanooga-area district of Republican Sen. Bo Watson, who is cosponsor of Senate Bill 836.
The bill would require public charter and K-12 schools to verify student immigration status and allow them to charge tuition — or deny enrollment entirely — to children who cannot provide proof of their legal immigration status.

“Our schools are not only institutions of learning — they are the heart of our neighborhoods, and they reflect our shared values of inclusion, dignity, and opportunity for all,” a news release from the principals’ association said.
“Denying this right not only contradicts our professional ethics and moral responsibilities, but also violates legal precedent grounded in the U.S. Constitution,” the release said, citing the 14th Amendment’s equal protection guarantees and Supreme Court precedent.
Watson and the bill’s cosponsor, House Leader William Lamberth, have said they hope the bill will be challenged in court and go onto serve as a vehicle to overturn the 1982 Supreme Court Plyler v. Doe decision that established all children have equal access to a public education, regardless of immigration status. The sponsors have also cited rising costs of English-language learning in public schools, but acknowledged there is currently no way to ascertain the immigration status of children receiving the instruction.
The two versions of the bill different in one key respect:  The House bill would make it optional to check student immigration status. The Senate version makes this mandatory in Tennessee’s more than 1700 public school and all public charter schools. Both bills allow schools to charge tuition or bar enrollment.
‘Economically reckless’ Small businesses slam bill to bar immigrant kids from school

The bill earlier this week drew opposition from more than two dozen small business owners in Watson’s district represented by the Tennessee Small Business Alliance. The alliance called the measure “economically reckless.”
On Monday, more than 240 Tennessee faith leaders issued an open letter to state lawmakers opposing the measure, which they called “cruel” and antithetical to their religious values.
And on Tuesday, a group of Montgomery County residents filed a complaint against Republican Rep. Aron Maberry with the Tennessee Ethics Commission over his support for the measure, alleging his support for the measure violates the School Board Code of Ethics that spells out a duty to provide equal education opportunities to all students.
The bill has drawn majority, but not unanimous support, from Tennessee Republicans. On Monday, the bill narrowly passed a House Committee with Rep. Jeremy Faison, a Republican from Cosby, noting that “nobody in my district asked me to vote for that bill” before he cast a “no” vote.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A bill that would regulate the psychoactive herb known as kratom vetoed last year by Gov. Dan McKee returned to the Rhode Island State House Tuesday night.
And things are different this time around, the lawmakers sponsoring the kratom legislation in the Rhode Island House and Senate assured colleagues in a pair of concurrent committee meetings. Last year’s version went six pages. The new iteration is 25 pages. 
“The governor did not love it,” Senate President Pro Tempore Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, said of the 2024 bill she sponsored and McKee later vetoed. “So we have worked for a whole year. The Rhode Island Kratom Act is the result of a year-long compromise developed in collaboration with the administration to replace prohibition with sensible regulations.”
Gallo returned as lead sponsor on this year’s bill, The Rhode Island Kratom Act, which was heard by the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Tuesday. The House companion is sponsored by Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Westerly Democrat, and was heard by the House Committee on Corporations.    
Kratom is a plant-derived drug with dose-dependent effects that can range from stimulating to sedating to euphoric. Thanks to its activity at the brain’s opioid receptors, people who are attempting to stop using or recovering from opioids sometimes use kratom as a replacement therapy. 
As of February 2024, Rhode Island is one of six states plus the District of Columbia that officially ban kratom. But it remains in legal limbo in many other states that don’t regulate it at all, allowing gray markets to dominate consumer supply — one reason why advocates want strict regulations in place.
Regulation advocates argue the danger of the kratom market lies in wildly potent formulations that are synthesized beyond naturally occurring limits in kratom-containing plants. Although the plant contains at least 45 alkaloids, or nitrogen-based chemical compounds, responsible for its psychoactive effects, most legislation aims to control two active ingredients in kratom products, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH).
Last year, a last-minute advocacy push generated enough support in both the Rhode Island House and Senate for bills posed as consumer protection legislation and based on similar, successful legislation passed in multiple states. Both the House and Senate bills passed on the final night of the legislative session in June, but McKee vetoed the bills about a week later.
Both the House and Senate sponsors pointed to the collaboration that led to this year’s version of the bill.

“I had the opportunity to sit with the governor and some of his staff, and he said, ‘Let’s work on this and try to create a piece of legislation that will work for the state of Rhode Island,’” Kennedy told his fellow state representatives on the House Committee on Corporations.
Kennedy said, adding that multiple state departments, including taxation and health officials, had also offered input on the bill. McKee wrote in his veto letter last year that one of his reasons he defeated the bill was that several state agencies requested a veto because of the bills’ lack of clarity on regulatory power. Which departments would be responsible for what? 
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, offered a more neutral assessment when asked for comment Tuesday ahead of the bill hearings.
“The Governor will review the bill in its final form if it reaches his desk,” DaRocha wrote. 
Mac Haddow, who spoke on behalf of the American Kratom Association, offered senators yet another interpretation: “The governor has indicated that the bill that’s before you today is acceptable to him, and if it passes the legislature, he will sign it.”
Haddow is not one of the two lobbyists listed in the Secretary of State’s portal who are paid $4,500 an hour to rally on behalf of the kratom association. Instead, Haddow serves as the organization’s senior fellow on public policy, and his name appears on testimony documents from legislatures across the country, like Kansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. 
But kratom advocacy exceeds U.S. borders — Matthew Lowe, the executive director of the Global Kratom Coalition, is based in South Africa, for instance. 
“I will say that the bill is complicated. It goes really far, 22 pages,” Lowe said in a phone interview ahead of Tuesday’s hearings. 
Lowe didn’t attend the hearings, but previewed many of the arguments made by proponents in committee hearings, including a 2024 Food and Drug Administration preliminary study of 40 people that found kratom to be tolerated well at most doses, though mild nausea was observed around 12 grams, a very high dose. With new research reinforcing the relative safety of the drug, Lowe argued, now’s the time to legalize and regulate, rather than leave kratom confined to black or gray markets where consumers buy products of questionable purity.   
That’s why the Kratom Consumer Protection Act has passed in multiple state legislatures, Lowe said: “I think it’s even less about the advocacy and more about the science. I think the science is developing,” Lowe added.
What about kratom cocktails?
Representing the Global Kratom Coalition’s interests at Tuesday’s hearings was Legislative Director Walker Gallman, who relayed that the revised bill is good, but still needs tweaking. Bill sponsor Kennedy, however, didn’t want to humor one of Gallman’s suggestions that would enable the sale of products that mix kratom with other substances. 
Kennedy asked Gallman if the industry sought to enable beverages that mix kratom with kava, another plant-based drug used as a mild tranquilizer. 
“That would be one of the products, yes. There are others,” Gallman said, noting that one of the coalition’s manufacturers makes a kratom-kava drink that has “safety studies.”
Kennedy said his bill was crafted with the state health department, and he’d prefer to keep its suggested language intact. Kratom cocktails would have to wait for future legislation, Kennedy said. 
Both bills were held for further study. Both bills also received testimony from Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, who testified in support of the bill.
“I have no life,” Smith told the House committee of her kratom research. “All I do is study this”
Smith agreed with Kennedy on one count. “I don’t think we should be mixing psychoactive products,” she said.
But, she also told the House committee, “There are real humans who use this very responsibly and depend on it for their longterm recovery.”

The limits of willow bark
Smith encountered more resistance in the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services. Four of the committee’s members voted against the old version of the bill on the Senate floor last June. One was Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and primary care nurse practitioner who grilled Smith about pharmacology — specifically, about kratom’s binding affinity, which describes how strongly substances interact with receptors in the body.  
“It does connect to the opioid receptor sites. Aside from how you theorize how it reacts there, it does,” Lauria said, adding that this needs to inform attempts about kratom’s interactions with other drugs. 
“It’s not an opioid. There are at least five mechanisms that are not opioid-related, that you can’t just put it in the opioid bucket,” Smith argued. “That’s not to say that the binding affinity isn’t there. It is. But that doesn’t mean it’s as a whole an opioid.”
But Smith conceded that people are going to mix drugs regardless: “If they’re going to do some polysubstance use, which is beyond our control, I would much prefer them to be informed consumers, as opposed to taking some random thing.”
Lauria had more questions for Jeffrey Bratberg, a clinical professor of pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island who spoke on behalf of the Rhode Island Pharmacists Association. Alluding to proponents’ arguments that kratom is natural, Lauria nudged Bratberg to list some other substances that come from plants. Cocaine and opium, Bratberg replied.
“We don’t use willow bark to treat pain. That’s what aspirin is derived from,” Bratberg noted. 
Existing medications like buprenorphine work as opioid replacements because they have been synthesized expressly for that purpose, Bratberg said. He concluded with an anecdote about artemisinin, an antimalarial drug that existed in raw plant form for thousands of years in Chinese medicine. It didn’t reach its true potential until being chemically extracted in 1972. 
“Purification matters,” Bratberg said.

Many of his columns, highlighting a wide variety of concerns in his home community, included the refrain, “Is anybody there? Does anybody care?”
That plaintive question came to mind Tuesday as I listened to Iowa senators debate what is likely to be the lone bill this year addressing nursing home regulation. Actually, “debate” is the wrong word. What happened was a refusal to debate.
Democrats introduced 14 bills this session in an effort to address critical failures in Iowa’s nursing homes. Failures like the one Iowa Capital Dispatch’s Clark Kauffman reported  Tuesday that led to what must have been agonizing pain, weeks of suffering and the eventual death of a resident at Sanford Senior Care in Sheldon.
State inspectors reported that in January, the resident had developed a “reddened area” on his coccyx, or tailbone. Nursing home staff did nothing, state records show – no assessment, treatment or physician contact – even after the sore developed into an open wound in February.
The man “looked absolutely awful,” an aide told inspectors later.  “There was bloody skin on both sides of the buttocks and continuing down it looked like hamburger,” the aide said, according to inspectors’ reports.
In March, the man was finally taken to the hospital with a Stage 4 wound that exposed muscle, bone or tendons. He died two days later of a staph infection.
Is anybody there? Does anybody care?
As anyone who reads Iowa Capital Dispatch regularly already knows, stories like this happen with shocking regularity.  Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner brought up several of them Tuesday on the Senate floor:

A resident at a care facility in Keota died from complications resulting from a fall after being found lying with bleeding head wound but not being transferred to a hospital until 15 days later.
In Wellman, where a nursing home worker found a woman lying on the floor with a “big goose egg” on the side of her head but was put to bed instead of being provided medical assistance. She was admitted to the hospital the next day and diagnosed with a brain bleed, fractured clavicle and urinary tract infection. She died a few weeks later of her injuries.
In Story City, a nursing home was cited for inadequate staffing twice in a month. The second time was after a resident known to need supervision while eating choked to death on a caramel brownie.

Not enough examples for you? Here are some others.

Nursing home sued after resident falls down concrete stairs in wheelchair
Resident chokes to death, home cited for rodents and staffing issues
Iowa care facilities recently cited for death, abuse and neglect
Nurse faces sentencing for wanton neglect in death of nursing home resident
Woman dies at Iowa nursing home recently acquired by private equity firm
Burns, ‘grapefruit-size’ wound and death trigger nursing home lawsuit
 Care facility fined $9,000 for infection, death

Is anybody there? Does anybody care?
The bills introduced by Sen. Claire Celsi, D-West Moines, would have required more frequent inspections of nursing homes and added 30 new inspectors to do the work. They would have increased fines for violations and allowed family members to install cameras in their loved ones’ rooms to help them monitor care. They would have prevented predatory private equity firms from buying out nursing home chains — a situation that has degraded care in Iowa facilities.
None of the bills received a hearing before a committee deadline, making all of them ineligible for debate in their original form.
That left Democrats to try to attach some of the proposals as amendments to the only nursing home bill the majority party has been inclined to consider. That bill would give nursing home operators an extra opportunity to avoid being cited for critical violations.
All of the amendments that would have expanded oversight were ruled out of order on Tuesday. The majority party senators could have chosen to debate these measures anyway. They did not.
Is anybody there? Does anybody care?
One might wonder what other issues the GOP majority in the Legislature finds more compelling than the safety of our elderly loved ones.
As an example, here’s what was happening in Des Moines while a man was dying in Sheldon:
On March 6, the same day the patient in Sheldon was admitted to the hospital after weeks of neglect, the Republican majority in the Statehouse was pushing its priority bills through the first of two deadlines for committee action. What were those priorities?
Well, they kept alive a bill to make sure 18-year-olds can carry a firearm, because that will make the rest of us feel a whole lot safer. They pushed forward election changes that will mean any Iowan with a foreign-sounding name or brown skin will want to carry their passport if they want to vote without a whole lot of red tape. And they backed the badge by passing a law to allow Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird to target a county sheriff who said in social media that he wasn’t going to comply with detainer requests from federal immigration enforcement unless they were “valid” ones.
What they weren’t doing is lifting a finger to make our elderly loved ones safer in long-term care.
There’s at least one more opportunity this year for lawmakers to do something meaningful for nursing home residents. They could include some of the Democrats’ oversight proposals and funding for additional inspectors in the state budget.
Sen. Kara Warme, R-Ames, said Tuesday she was “sympathetic” to the concerns raised by the Democrats – as she was seeking to have their proposals dismissed.
“I’m sympathetic to the concerns raised by the senators, and I believe resident safety is a top priority in our nursing facilities,” she said.
Iowa has a lot of excellent nursing homes with caring staff, to be sure. But turning a blind eye to the abuse, neglect and literal torture that residents are enduring in some facilities is the opposite of sympathy.

(Photo via Google Earth)  Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa, a faith-based health care provider, is arguing in a medical malpractice case that the loss of an unborn child does not equate to the death of a “person” for the purpose of calculating damage awards.
In Iowa, court-ordered awards for noneconomic losses stemming from medical malpractice are capped at $250,000, except in cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body.”
Attorneys for the CHI and Mercy One hospital are arguing the cap on damages still applies in cases where the “loss” is that of a fetus or unborn child.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
CHI’s status as a nonprofit, tax-exempt entity is based on its stated mission of providing health services “in the spirit of the gospel.” The ethics guidelines it approved in 2018 state that the corporation is committed to “respect the sacredness of every human life from the moment of conception until death.”
The lawsuit in which CHI is currently embroiled involves the treatment provided to Miranda Anderson of Poweshiek County. Anderson was 34 weeks pregnant when, on April 13, 2021, she arrived at Pella Regional Health Center for evaluation due to elevated blood pressure, headaches and edema.
Citing concerns that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby and may require early delivery — Anderson was transferred to MercyOne’s Obstetrics Emergency Unit via ambulance.
According to the lawsuit later filed by Anderson and her husband, Landen, Miranda Anderson was discharged after two days of monitoring and testing. After further evaluations over the course of the next several days, she was again discharged to her home — until, during an April 21 evaluation, her doctor was unable to detect any fetal heartbeat. The next day, she underwent a cesarean delivery of a nonviable baby girl, Eloise.
The Andersons’ lawsuit seeks damages for negligence, alleging CHI, MercyOne and its physicians failed to recommend early delivery of the baby while it was still viable and Anderson showed evidence of preeclampsia. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
Citing the state’s $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in malpractice cases — a cap that was approved by state legislators in 2017 — CHI and MercyOne are arguing that while the cap on damages includes an exemption for cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body,” that exemption should not apply to a case where a fetus or unborn child is lost.
They argue the Iowa Legislature did not intend for the loss of a baby prior to delivery to be included within the exemption and that Anderson’s lawyers are attempting “to put words in the Legislature’s mouth … There is no case law, and plaintiffs cite to none, finding ‘loss of pregnancy’ is a ‘loss or impairment of a bodily function.’”
As evidence of this, they cite the fact that in 2023 — two years after the Anderson pregnancy — state lawmakers explicitly added “loss of pregnancy” to the exemption on the cap for damages. Attorneys for Anderson argue the 2023 change was enacted merely to clarify the scope of the 2017 statute, not to expand the exemption on the caps for damages.
In recent court filings, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne argue that “finding an unborn child to be a ‘person’ would lead to serious implications in other areas of the law.” They also argue the Andersons’ unborn child should not be considered a “patient” for purposes of calculating damages.
“There is no statute or binding case law finding an unborn child to be a ‘patient’ under the law,” attorneys for the hospital have told the court, citing an Iowa Supreme Court ruling in a 1971 case that held “there can be no recovery (of damages) on behalf of, or for, a nonexistent person.”
As part of their case, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne also argue that the Iowa Legislature’s decision to cap noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases was motivated by a desire to “reduce the size of medical malpractice verdicts to increase the affordability and availability of medical care and protect the public treasury.”
The hospital is now seeking a court order affirming the Andersons’ recovery for any noneconomic damages that might be awarded shall be limited to $250,000 under the cap approved by legislators in 2017. A hearing on that issue is expected later this month, while the case itself is scheduled for trial on May 12, 2025.
Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa and MercyOne did not respond to calls and emails from the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Wednesday.

(Adam Gray/Getty Images)An immigration judge plans to decide as soon as this week whether or not Mahmoud Khalil – a former Columbia University student targeted by the Trump administration over his involvement in student-led protests  – can be deported or not.
After a brief hearing on Tuesday at the LaSalle Immigration Court in Jena, Judge Jamee Comans ordered attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to hand over evidence against Khalil, by the end of the business day on Wednesday. Comans said she will rule on, whether Khalil, a Syrian-born Palestinian who is a legal permanent U.S. resident, can be removed from the country at a hearing later this week.
Comans indicated that she intends to make a decision as quickly as possible since Khalil has already been held in immigration detention since early March.
“Your client’s detained and if he’s not removable I don’t want him detained,” Comans said. “I’m not gonna keep him detained while attorneys argue about his removability.”
Khalil’s case, which is playing out in both LaSalle Parish and New Jersey, has drawn international attention since Khalil was picked up in his New York City apartment last month by federal immigration agents as part of a Trump administration crackdown.
Khalil is being targeted because he worked with protesters during large protests against Israel’s war in Gaza on Columbia’s campus last year. Top officials in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have accused Khalil of supporting Hamas, the group that controls the Gaza Strip, which the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization.
But civil rights advocates say the administration is focusing on Khalil — as well as other student protesters swept up in recent ICE actions —  over his political speech, violating his First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution.
Khalil — who has been held in the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center for about a month — appeared before an unusually crowded courtroom for the Tuesday hearing. Khalil sat alone at a desk facing the judge and a screen where his lawyers and his wife appeared. Khalil fingered Muslim prayer beads in his right hand as his lead attorney, Mark Van Der Hout, discussed with the judge how to proceed on the case.

Van Der Hout pushed for more time to prepare for the case against Kahlil’s deportation because his team had neither  seen nor been able to respond to evidence from DHS attorneys. Comans repeatedly said a full hearing with the evidence would allow her to rule on whether Khalil should be deported or not.
She said if she orders Khalil removed, then his attorneys will have an opportunity to argue for some form of relief from deportation.
The matter before Comans is separate from a legal case his attorneys are pursuing in a New Jersey federal court. Attorneys in the New Jersey case are arguing that Khalil’s arrest and continued detention in federal immigration custody are unlawful. The Louisiana case is based on the Trump administration’s claims that Khalil should be deported.
On Tuesday, however, Comans said she would delay ruling until after DHS provides evidence backing up the Trump administration’s charges against Khalil.
In government filings, Khalil is charged with posing a serious threat to U.S. foreign policy. DHS, which is prosecuting the case, also claims Khalil intentionally withheld information about his former employment and about his membership in a Pro-Palestine university organization when he applied for his green card. He is being charged under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the Secretary of State to remove any non-citizen deemed to be a threat to U.S. foreign policy.
The government has until 5 p.m. Wednesday Central time to submit that evidence. Comans has set another hearing for Friday, during which she will rule.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill that would permit motorcyclists to stand up while driving their vehicle is nearly headed to the governor’s desk.
“Standing up on the foot pegs just gives you so much more control when a bump is coming up. Your legs act like shock absorbers,” said Sen. Mark Maynard, R-Wayne, who voted in support of the measure. “This is just heinous that if somebody does this, they would be ticketed.”
The Senate signed off on the measure, House Bill 2752, Monday evening with a vote of 27-6. The bill passed out of the House of Delegates March 19, spurring a viral video that showed Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, yelling, “Vroom! Vroom! West Virginia,” before criticizing the Republican-backed bill, saying it was unnecessary and did nothing to help residents of the state.

Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel also questioned why lawmakers were spending time on the legislation. He called it the “Organ Donor Act of 2025.”
“I’ve put up with a lot of shenanigans this session,” said Woelfel, D-Cabell. “But why are we taking up the Senate’s time with a bill to allow people legally to stand up on their motorcycles while the motorcycle is moving forward?”
“Of all the issues we have in our state, we’re going to make legislation to let people be Evel Knievel? I’d like to have a no vote to send a message down the hallway,” he continued.
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, said she had been told that the bill, which originated in the House, was needed. 
“Right now if you stand up – you still have your feet on the foot pegs — it is a crime. They needed this legislation to allow them to stand up.”
Motorcyclists are already instructed to stand up in certain situations as part of their required instruction to obtain a motorcycle license, according to bill sponsor Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam. The bill also includes mopeds and motor-driven cycles. 
The House will have to concur with the Senate’s vote before the legislation heads to Gov. 
Patrick Morrisey’s desk for consideration.

The Nasdaq index saw the biggest single-day hike in five years as of Wednesday afternoon, according to financial media.The pause will not extend to China, which he announced will see a further hike to 125% on imports to the U.S. “effective immediately,” he said.“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump posted on Truth Social just after 1 p.m. Eastern.The president said more than 75 countries have reached out to negotiate, and that because “these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States” he is dropping their tariff rates to a universal 10%.Several rounds of tariffs the president enacted in March will remain in place, including 25% import taxes on foreign steel, aluminum and cars — charges which sparked the European Union to approve retaliatory tariffs Wednesday.Canada and Mexico, which both face up to 25% tariffs on a sizable chunk of products, will continue to see the levies but will not face an additional 10% stacked on top.Trump’s 25% tax on imports from any country that buys oil from Venezuela also remains unchanged.Americans ‘yippy’The president told the press outside the White House Wednesday afternoon that he saw people getting “queasy” and “yippy” about the market turmoil.“You have to have flexibility,” Trump said about his decision to pause the levies.The tariffs, which the administration maintains are “reciprocal,” though under a formula disputed by economists, went into effect just after midnight Wednesday.When asked by reporters if he’ll consider exempting any large companies that lost big in the market crash from paying the baseline 10% import tax, Trump said he’ll rely on his “instinct” to make the decision.The announcement came just hours after the president posted on social media “BE COOL!” and “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.”Trump’s sudden pause also came just after U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the steep tariffs to nervous lawmakers for the second day in a row.Administration officials quickly claimed the sudden pause was part of Trump’s strategy all along — despite several saying over the last few days that the tariffs were here to stay and that Americans needed to have patience as the market crashed. More than half of Americans are invested in the stock market.White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller characterized Trump’s about-face on tariffs as “the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,” in a post on X Wednesday afternoon.A rollercoaster few daysTrump’s tariff plan sent shock waves through the economy after he unveiled import taxes on trading partners and allies, including 46% for Vietnam, a major tech exporter to the U.S.The administration calculated the steep tariff rates based on each country’s trade deficit with the U.S.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters outside the White House Wednesday that the tariffs were “a successful negotiating strategy.”“As I told everyone a week ago in this very spot: Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded,” Bessent said.The administration met with Vietnamese officials Wednesday, according to Bessent, and meetings with Japan, South Korea and India are expected shortly, though he didn’t provide details.When asked by reporters if Trump’s tariff policy was mainly now focused on China, Bessent said “it’s about bad actors” but added that China “is the biggest source of the U.S. trade problems.”The trade war — a term Bessent rejected — between the U.S. and China expanded rapidly overnight Wednesday when Chinese officials raised levies on U.S. goods to 84%.“The US's practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system,” according to a translation of a statement Wednesday from the country’s State Council Tariff Commission.Pressure from lawmakersA Trump campaign account posted on X a screenshot of the president’s morning message urging people to buy stocks and asked “Did the Panicans listen to @POTUS’s advice this morning?”“Panicans” is a term Trump used recently to mock lawmakers who openly criticized losses to retirement funds and questioned how the tariffs would affect small businesses in their districts.Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma grilled Greer Tuesday during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance.“Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves wrong?” Tillis asked.Greer faced questions Wednesday morning from the House Committee on Ways and Means, where Chair Jason Smith of Missouri cheered on Trump’s choice to unleash tariffs on almost every country at once.Rep. Richard Neal, the panel’s top Democrat, told Greer that his office has been “inundated” with calls from constituents worried about their 401k funds.“They don't know what to expect, trillions of dollars of market value being lost even as we meet,” the Massachusetts Democrat said at the morning hearing before Trump called off the tariffs.   Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said Wednesday that he’s asking the White House if any insider trading occurred while Trump was “creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs.”“Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense?” Schiff wrote on X.Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa introduced a bipartisan bill to claw back Congressional power over trade decisions from the president, who currently has near-unilateral authority.GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska introduced companion legislation in the House.While Trump imposed some of his tariffs — including those on foreign steel and aluminum — under a national security provision, he levied the charges on Canadian and Mexican imports as well as his recent worldwide tariffs by declaring a national emergency.",,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

Amy Galey (R-Alamance) explains her proposal to alter the public school calendar to the Senate education Committee on Wednesday, April 9, 2025 (Photo: Screengrab from NCGA video feed)The North Carolina Senate Education Committee voted on Wednesday to approve a bill that seeks to settle an issue that has plagued and divided state and local policymakers for more than two decades.
Senate Bill 754, which is entitled “School Calendar Flexibility: A New Alternative” would offer school districts two options for commencing the new school year. One follows the current law, which requires a start date no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 26 and an end date no later than the Friday closest to June. The second and new option would allow schools to start on the Monday closest to Aug. 19, with the school year ending no later than the Friday before Memorial Day.
The bill is sponsored by Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), and Sens. Amy Galey (R-Alamance), and Michael Lee (R-New Hanover).
On Wednesday, Galey told members of the Senate Education/Higher Education Committee that the bill represents a compromise between the forces that helped enact the current law in 2004 (the state travel and tourism industry and a group of parents concerned about preserving summer vacations) and local education officials who would prefer even greater flexibility in setting the public school calendar. She said that as many as a quarter of the state’s 116 districts are out of compliance with the current law.
Though the bill was approved on an almost unanimous voice vote and forwarded to the Judiciary Committee (among other things, the measure includes language that would allow businesses to sue local boards that set school calendars in violation of its specified dates), two Democratic senators voiced concern that the bill does not go far enough in addressing the needs and expertise of local school districts.
Both Sens. Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford) and Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) argued that there are many situations in which local school districts would be better able to meet the needs of children in their communities by starting the school year earlier in August – a freedom, Robinson noted, that’s already given to charter schools.

Galey, with support from Sen. Bobby Hanig – a Republican who represents several coastal counties – responded that there are many families and businesses who are severely burdened by earlier start dates and that the bill was an attempt to find a middle ground.
In addition to the potential legal liability included in the bill for counties that fail to abide by the new start date, the measure also includes language – sought most aggressively by mountain counties that must cope with more snow days in the winter – that would permit the school year closing date to be extended in situations where districts experience closures due to extreme weather.
The bill would take effect in the 2026-‘27 school year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sen.-Amy-Galey.png,,,2025-04-09 14:12:17.580920

The investigation and documentary reveals that the Border Patrol detained 77 people with no prior criminal history despite claiming operation targeted criminals.


A powerful new documentary from CalMatters — the organization’s first venture into film, thanks to a partnership with Evident Media and Bellingcat — is a revealing look into a U.S. Border Patrol operation.
The collaboration exposes significant discrepancies between official accounts and the reality of a three-day immigration raid in Bakersfield. The investigation and documentary stems from Olmos’ initial Jan. 10 report for CalMatters on the immigration raids in Kern County in the final days of Joe Biden’s presidency.
“This deeply-reported CalMatters investigation becomes richly powerful through the partnership with Evident and Bellingcat,” said CalMatters Editor-in-Chief Kristen Go. “The meshing of on-the-ground reporting and exhaustive examination with bold visual storytelling and gripping video editing will reach and resonate with a wide audience.”
The investigation, combining a powerful documentary report with a detailed article and analysis of more than 50 videos taken by civilians, directly challenges U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) claims about the raid, “Operation: Return to Sender.” CBP asserted the operation was “highly targeted” against immigrants with criminal records. However, the Department of Homeland Security’s own data, obtained for this report, reveals that CBP had no prior knowledge of any criminal or immigration history for 77 of the 78 individuals detained during the three-day raid.
The documentary, narrated by Sergio Olmos of CalMatters, features reporting from Olmos and CalMatters reporter Wendy Fry. It includes interviews with farm laborers, growers, legal experts and CBP leadership, including El Centro Sector Chief Patrol Agent, Gregory Bovino.
This is CalMatters first documentary, following a previous CBS video collaboration on the devastating effects of endless wildfires on the mental health of firefighters, earning CalMatters the organization’s first Emmy.
The Border Patrol investigation was produced in partnership with Evident Media, a newly launched nonprofit documentary news organization. The documentary also features reporting from the open-source reporting collective Bellingcat.
Kevin Clancy, co-founder of Evident, who also served as the producer and director of photography for the film said, “This project demonstrates the power of collaboration within nonprofit journalism. Evident was created to tell stories just like this, where visible evidence becomes the crucial missing link in uncovering the full picture.” The full investigation is available on both CalMatters and Evident.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/022525-Evident-Border-Trip-EM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-10 14:11:43.000662

The licensing, regulatory and inspection functions for the industry will be shifted to a separate division within the Department of Consumer Protection, the agency announced on Wednesday. Lila McKinley, a DCP attorney who has been involved in developing the regulations for Connecticut’s adult-use cannabis market, will lead that new arm of the agency.
The regulatory shift was being developed before state officials were forced to apologize for the inspection incident at cultivation facility in Portland, but its implementation was accelerated as a result, a department spokesperson said.
DCP officials sent an email to all of the licensed cannabis operators in the state Wednesday morning informing them of the creation of the new regulatory office, which oversee both medical and recreation marijuana.
“For nearly a year, we have contemplated organizational changes that would allow for more specialized attention to your complex and growing industry,” the message to license holders said. “This change reflects your evolving industry as we are restructuring to better meet your regulatory needs.”
Bryan Cafferelli, the commissioner of consumer protection, said the way the state previously regulated the cannabis industry made sense when dispensaries were limited to selling medical marijuana. But he said the oversight functions needed to change now that Connecticut companies are selling tens of millions of dollars in recreational weed every month.
“Restructuring the Drug Control Division has been in the works for nearly a year, as we contemplated the best way to meet the growing needs and complexities of the cannabis industry while ensuring continued success in our regulation of the pharmaceutical industry in Connecticut,” Cafferelli said in a statement.
“Our agency is adapting to meet the needs of both industries and protect public health and safety,” he added. 
Rep. Roland J. Lemar, the co-chair of the General Law Committee, said he welcomes the reorganization under McKinley, who has worked at DCP for more than a decade and most recently served as the Legal Program Director for the Drug Control Division.
“From my viewpoint, this is a positive development both for the state and the cannabis industry in Connecticut. I think she has a great relationship with the industry. She knows it well as an attorney who has worked through a number of issues over the past few years,” Lemar said.
Rodrick J. Marriott, a pharmacist by training, will remain as director of DCP’s Drug Control Division, which will continue to regulate pharmacies and controlled-substance providers and manufacturers.
It was under Marriott’s leadership that state inspectors from the Drug Control Division conducted the unannounced visit at a cultivation facility owned by Affinity Grow last month.
DCP officials have declined to say who ordered that inspection, which took place a day after Rino Ferrarese, Affinity Grow’s chief executive, criticized the state’s testing protocols for recreational marijuana during a legislative hearing.
Cafferelli, the DCP commissioner, apologized for the incident the following day and made no attempt to suggest there was a legitimate reason for what he called an “unannounced compliance check.”
Some cannabis business owners in the state said they were not aware prior to Wednesday that DCP intended to shift regulatory oversight for their industry to a new division. But they believed the move would be positive for the state and their businesses.
Ben Zachs, an executive with Fine Fettle, which operates multiple dispensaries in the state, said shifting oversight to a division devoted solely to cannabis is a sign of the industry growing and maturing in Connecticut. 
The number of cannabis companies in operation in Connecticut continues to grow, Zachs said, and the rate of that growth requires more focus on the part of state regulators. 
“I think it’s good that cannabis will be treated as its own department,” he added. “The scale needs a different focus and prioritization.” 
Zachs was complimentary of DCP’s management of the industry in past years, and he said he looks forward to working with McKinley, who he said is familiar to everyone in the state’s growing cannabis industry. 
“We’ve worked with Lila for years now. I’ve always found her to be thoughtful and open-minded,” Zachs said. 
Adam Wood, the founder of the Connecticut Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, also spoke highly of McKinley, who has represented the state within the Cannabis Regulators Association, a body made up of state agencies that oversee recreational marijuana markets.
“Lila is extremely well qualified and very knowledgeable here in Connecticut and beyond our borders,” he said.
Wood said shifting licensing and inspection to a dedicated cannabis office is taking place at an opportune time as companies continue to stand up new dispensaries and grow facilities. 
“There is a lot of cultivation and new manufacturing just coming online,” Wood said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/marijuana-mold.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.

“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.

Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.











It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician



From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.

Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

Read this story in English.
A partir del 7 de mayo, todos los residentes de Connecticut al igual que todos los residentes del país, deberán tener su licencia de conducir o tarjeta de identificación estatal que cumpla con el REAL ID para poder usarla en vuelos nacionales.
La Ley REAL ID de 2005, aprobada por recomendación de la Comisión del 11-S, se diseñó para crear estándares federales de seguridad para las tarjetas de identificación emitidas por los Estados.
Tras múltiples retrasos en la implementación, que las autoridades atribuyeron en parte a los retrasos causados ​​por la pandemia de COVID-19, el requisito finalmente entrará en vigor el próximo mes.
Esto es lo que debe saber:
¿Cumplo con el REAL ID?
Si su licencia de conducir o tarjeta de identificación estatal tiene una estrella dorada en la esquina superior derecha, cumple con el REAL ID.
Actualmente, alrededor del 73 % de los residentes de Connecticut con identificación emitida por el DMV tienen un REAL ID, según Ernie Bertothy, portavoz del Departamento de Motor Vehículos de Connecticut. El DMV ha estado emitiendo tarjetas REAL ID desde octubre de 2011, cuando comenzó a ofrecer a los clientes la opción de solicitar un REAL ID al renovar su licencia de conducir o tarjeta de identificación emitida por el DMV.
Los menores de 18 años no necesitarán un REAL ID para volar. La Administración de Seguridad en el Transporte (TSA) no exige que los menores presenten identificación para vuelos nacionales.
Mi licencia de conducir o tarjeta de identificación no cumple con los requisitos de REAL ID. ¿Qué debo hacer?
Los residentes de Connecticut pueden obtener una tarjeta que cumpla con los requisitos de REAL ID programando una cita con el DMV o una oficina asociada, como AAA. Aunque el DMV ofrece servicios de renovación de licencias en línea, las citas para el REAL ID deben ser presenciales.
Las oficinas del DMV están abiertas de martes a sábado, y Bertothy indicó que ofrecerán citas adicionales para el REAL ID el 7 y el 14 de abril, y próximamente habrá más fechas.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Straight off a prison stint cut short by a presidential pardon, former Tennessee Sen. Brian Kelsey is maneuvering for legislation to pay his legal expenses.
The ex-Germantown Republican who served two weeks in federal prison for directing an illicit campaign finance scheme is lobbying lawmakers to pass legislation that would enable him to use his state campaign account to pay legal fees after three years of court battles.
Republican Sen. Richard Briggs of Knoxville confirmed Wednesday that Kelsey called him twice to ask him to put an amendment on a campaign finance bill he’s sponsoring this session. Republican Rep. Tim Hicks of Washington County is sponsoring the House version of the bill, and Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is a co-sponsor.
Briggs wasn’t certain what sort of amendment Kelsey was seeking. Kelsey also contacted Hicks, according to Briggs.
But Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance, said the former senator wants to be able to use state campaign funds to pay for legal expenses. 
Former Tennessee Sen. Brian Kelsey gains Trump pardon two weeks after heading to prison

Kelsey hired at least six attorneys after being indicted for violating federal campaign finance law by funneling more than $80,000 through two political action committees to the American Conservative Union, which paid for ads in his failed 2016 congressional race. It is illegal to use state campaign money to pay for a federal campaign because the funds are raised under different rules.
The Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance turned down Kelsey’s previous request to use funds left in his state account to pay legal fees. Kelsey had $197,519 in his state account before transferring it to his Red State Political Action Committee in June 2023. The PAC has more than $180,300, according to the latest filing with the state.
Briggs’ bill is stuck in the Senate finance committee because of a provision that would take part of the professional privilege tax paid by lobbyists to hire auditors and pay for a new campaign finance reporting system for the Registry of Election Finance and Ethics Commission.
Kelsey served two weeks in a federal prison in Kentucky this year before receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump. The former senator stepped down from his Senate post four years ago after being indicted. He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges but then rescinded his plea, claiming he didn’t violate any laws.
Kelsey hired a handful of attorneys after releasing his first legal counsel team. He also claimed his decision to plead guilty was clouded by the birth of twin sons and the illness of his father, who later died. Kelsey also said he didn’t understand the criminal law system even though he was an attorney and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Criteria for Secretary of Education Scholars
“These students are leaders in and out of the classroom,” Marten said. “They are excelling — often in college-level courses — while leading school clubs, musical ensembles, sports teams and community service projects. They balance their studies while working part-time and volunteering in their communities. I was inspired by each and every one of them last night. I especially loved hearing their self-reflections on what inspired their success, which often pointed to the family members, educators and peers who supported them.”
The Secretary of Education Scholars were recognized for their dedication, leadership, and commitment to their education and communities.
Many of the students shared personal reflections on what inspired their success, often citing the unwavering support of family members, educators, and peers.
In addition to the celebration dinner, the scholars are now being showcased on a dedicated website, where their achievements are highlighted through photographs, nomination statements from their principals, and personal narratives from the students themselves.
This annual recognition program, which has been honoring students since 1984, selects scholars based on their academic excellence, leadership within their schools, and contributions to their communities.
The number of scholars chosen from each school is determined by enrollment, with principals nominating the students who best embody these qualities.
The Class of 2025’s Secretary of Education Scholars represent a bright future for the state, reflecting the value of hard work, community involvement, and academic perseverance.

Christian Chenet, 28, was being held in the Cole County Jail. Bond will be set later today, Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson said in an email and Chenet will have his first court appearance Friday if he does not post bond.
The first degree harassment charge is a felony and the assault charge is a misdemeanor.
“Harassment and assault cases are kept on an automatic 24 hour hold, so he won’t have the ability to bond out until the judge sets a bond,” Thompson said.
The incident that led to charges began about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday when Chenet, who is a legislative assistant to state Rep. Kem Smith, a St. Louis Democrat, went to Izzy’s Burgers and Shakes to retrieve a purse left behind by state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Columbia Democrat.
Smith declined to comment on Chenet’s arrest. Steinhoff also declined to comment. There is no attorney yet listed for Chenet on Casenet.
The incident became heated when the owner of Izzy’s, Taisir Yanis, refused to turn over the purse, looked inside to determine the owner and stated he could only release it to Steinhoff.
“This enraged the defendant and he became angry that the victim was in the purse,” according to the probable cause statement from Jefferson City Police officer Mitchell Rossian.
Chenet called Yanis a “f**king racist,” Rossian wrote, who told Chenet to leave and followed him outside.
Yanis told officers that he told Chenet not to come back to the business, Rossian wrote. Yanis told officers that is when Chenet told him, “stay here. I’m going to go get my gun.”
Chenet went to a vehicle and told responding officers that he had a gun in the car. A search found a Glock 9mm pistol.
Chenet told officers that Yanis pushed him and he ran to his vehicle. He said had called 911 and “mentioned shooting (Yanis).”
Under questioning, Rossian wrote, Chenet “still thought his actions were justified during the interview.”

Gretchen Whitmer called on lawmakers to work across the aisle to improve on the nation's shipbuilding, aviation and semiconductor chip manufacturing efforts during her Build, America, Build Address in Washington, D.C. on April 9, 2025 | ScreenshotStepping on stage in Washington, D.C. Wednesday morning, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer laid out her plan to rejuvenate American manufacturing, centering her strategy on shipbuilding, aviation and semiconductor chips. 
However, that vision faces a big hurdle, as President Donald Trump launches a global trade war, placing tariffs on allies and enemies alike and creating broad uncertainty for businesses in Michigan and across the nation. 
While Whitmer played to her bipartisan background, she didn’t mince words on the way Trump’s tariffs have impacted Michigan, noting that 20% of the state’s economy is tied to the auto industry, which depends on international trading partners. 
Michigan is also home to the busiest international border crossing in the U.S. With more than 10,000 trucks carrying parts and materials between Detroit and Windsor every weekday, the state is already seeing impacts from Trump’s tariffs. 
“Auto companies are stockpiling parts and laying off workers. Suppliers are facing higher costs and delaying expansions. Dealerships are forced to raise prices by up to $15,000 amid the slowing sales. And since every auto job supports three others in the community, the impact is being felt by all of us including small businesses across my state,” Whitmer said.

Looking beyond the auto industry, these tariffs represent a triple whammy for U.S. residents, Whitmer said, bringing higher costs on everyday goods, fewer jobs and increased uncertainty. 
While she agrees with Trump’s reasoning for the tariffs — supporting fair trade and increasing manufacturing in the U.S. — Whitmer called for a tariff carveout for autos and energy, and proposed working with U.S. allies to compete against its adversaries and leveraging increased investments into manufacturing. 
“I’m proud that the amount of money being spent to build factories in America has more than tripled over a decade. In Michigan, we’ve secured dozens of new facilities to build chips, batteries, cars and energy. Just this year, major companies have announced huge investments in America to build data centers and factories, and research facilities. Here’s my pitch: let’s keep going,” Whitmer said.

“Let’s make more ships, planes and semiconductor chips in America. Let’s cut red tape and unleash the extraordinary potential of American industry. Let’s give more hardworking people a fair shot at a decent life. And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘golden age’ of American manufacturing,” she said. 
She laid out the threats and challenges the nation faces as it works to support manufacturing in these industries, noting that each American shipyard is short more than 100,000 workers, while the aviation industry faces a similarly shrinking workforce. 

While the U.S. builds 0.1% of the world’s ships, China builds 53%, Whitmer said, with its largest state-owned ship company building more ships by tonnage last year than the U.S. has in the past 80 years. 
“Last September, the United States Navy set an ambitious goal of building hundreds more ships and submarines over the next few decades. If we don’t progress toward that goal, China’s naval fleet could be 50% larger than ours by 2030,” Whitmer warned, later calling for the expansion of job training programs for maritime manufacturing like Michigan’s M3 initiative. 
The Governor also noted that China’s largest passenger plane company, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation, is now making planes that are competing with the best selling American models on the market, and is on the verge of challenging the American-owned Boeing and European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, with the company receiving funding from the Chinese government.
“This should serve as a wake-up call to this country,” she said. 
“If we don’t hit the throttle while we lead in commercial and military aviation, China will pass us. That’s something we can’t afford. We must protect our lead, and Michigan is ready to do what it takes to win this. We can lean on our manufacturing expertise and skilled workforce to boost domestic aviation manufacturing,” Whitmer said, pointing to the precedent set in World War II when automakers shifted from producing cars and trucks to airplanes, tanks, guns and shells. 
While Michigan is doing its part, it can’t support the aerospace and defense industry on its own Whitmer said, calling on Washington to put together a national strategy and make bipartisan investments into America’s aviation industry and workforce.
“If we are proactive, we can create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and protect our national security, and lower costs for travelers around the world and here at home.” Whitmer said. 
She also called for additional investments into semiconductor chip manufacturing, pointing to the role of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in boosting chip manufacturing, with the U.S. on track to make 20% of the world’s logic chips and 10% of D-RAM chips. 
“Both Democrats and Republicans agree that we must stay on the bleeding edge of technology. The President even mentioned chips in his speech to Congress and set up a new United States investment accelerator to oversee semiconductor projects. We have the momentum right now, and we cannot risk stepping back or faltering. We need to continue strong, bipartisan efforts at the state and national level to make more chips,” Whitmer said. 
While partisanship has infected every aspect of American lives, there’s more common ground than people think Whitmer said, pointing to the consensus between Democrats and Republicans to manufacture more goods in the U.S. 
“Building an industrial economy is no small task. It’s thousands of small tasks, and each of us—government, industry, entrepreneurs, workers—we’re part of the same pit crew…. If we do our jobs, we can get America back on the track better and faster than ever,” Whitmer said. 
Just as pit crews in the Detroit Grand Prix use teamwork, data driven strategies and the best products to get their car refueled, tuned up and heading toward the checkered flag as soon as possible, Whitmer said the U.S. should do the same in boosting its manufacturing economy.
“I know there’s been a lot of talk recently about government efficiency. But all the proposed solutions have been solely focused on firing people from the crew or stripping away critical parts. That’s no way to win a race. If we really want to win — and keep winning — we need to reinvest in our crew and build better parts. In our darkest hours, that’s exactly what we did,” Whitmer said, pointing to the manufacturing strategies of World War II and the coordination of Operation Warp Speed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which worked to speed up development of a vaccine for the disease. 
“I still remember the pride I felt when I watched the Pfizer vaccine get packed into trucks rolling out of Portage, Michigan. People stood outside on the road even though it was bitter cold, waving the Stars and Stripes, proud of what we had done. It was an extraordinary achievement that showed us what’s possible when we work together to streamline government and allow America to do what it does best: innovate and build,” Whitmer said. 
Following her speech, Whitmer sat down with journalist and Lift Our Voices Co-Founder Gretchen Carlson to talk more about tariffs, bipartisan collaboration and the state of the Democratic Party. 
When asked how she would have implemented tariffs differently, Whitmer said the current approach of treating trade partners in Mexico and Canada like adversaries would cost everyone, from lost auto jobs to increased prices on cars and blueberries from Mexico. 
“The big loser in this is American manufacturing and is the American consumer,” she said before underscoring the importance of enforcing the law against Chinese companies coming into the U.S.

She later explained that while she agrees there should be more manufacturing in the U.S. for both the economic benefits and to stem national security concerns, the supply chains that the U.S. has built with its North American neighbors rely on a seamless flow. 
“Perhaps we should be onshoring and the goal is great, but we need to be realistic. That doesn’t happen overnight. There are suppliers that are still trying to recover from inflation and COVID who are on the bubble and don’t have the resources to weather this up-and-down, uncertain time that, you know, where the rules keep changing,” Whitmer said. 
While Trump’s announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico won support from United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who said the levies could help bring auto jobs back to U.S. soil, Whitmer argued these efforts would harm everyone including autoworkers, pointing to the harm the auto industry has already seen from the tariffs. 
Carlson noted that Whitmer could have given this speech at home in Lansing, and asked whether her trip to D.C. was an indicator of presidential ambition. However, Whitmer dismissed the notion.
“No, no. This is my way of saying —this is similar to speeches that I’ve given in Michigan too, by the way — this is, I think, a blueprint for success. This is what we did in Michigan during World War II. This is what we are capable of as a nation,” Whitmer said. “We need leadership that stays focused on doing these things so Americans can get to work doing the big manufacturing that we are falling behind on globally, so that we can harness the strength of American companies, American institutions of education and the American workforce. That’s what this is all about.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-8.36.14 AM-1024x640.png,,,2025-04-09 13:19:56.431331

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s warning comes after two previous measles cases in Pueblo and Denver. Unlike in those two cases, the Archuleta County resident, an adult whose vaccination status has not been confirmed, did not recently travel internationally.
“This case does not appear to be linked to the other cases reported in Colorado and the individual did not travel outside of Colorado, which leaves open the possibility of community transmission,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “We urge Coloradans to monitor for symptoms if they may have been exposed, and to make sure they are up to date on their (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations.”

Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine provide about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado has not had three measles cases confirmed in the same calendar year in at least 12 years, according to state data.
The infections come amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas and neighboring states that have caused at least two deaths of unvaccinated children. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. While state law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, it allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
CDPHE officials say people may have been exposed to measles at the Wolf Creek Ski Area and Resort between March 28 and 30; the Pagosa Springs City Market on March 31; and the Pagosa Medical Group clinic at 27B Talisman Dr. on March 31 and April 2. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

The Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) Police Department will once again participate in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) 28th National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day on Saturday, April 26.
The event aims to reduce the risks associated with unused and expired prescription medications by providing a secure and convenient way for the public to dispose of potentially dangerous drugs.
From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on April 26, the DRBA Police will host three collection sites for residents to safely drop off expired or unused medications.
DRBA’s event locations
These sites will be located at the Wilmington Airport Terminal in New Castle, Del., the Lewes Ferry Terminal in Lewes, Del., and the Cape May Ferry Terminal in Cape May, N.J. Participants are encouraged to clear out old prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and even expired animal medications and vitamins.

“We’re pleased to be able to once again participate in this national program to take old prescription drugs and expired over-the-counter medicines out of circulation,” said Col. Wayne McFadden of the DRBA Police Department. “With the proper disposal of unused or expired prescription drugs, you’re ensuring that these medications don’t find their way into the wrong hands. We encourage folks to take advantage of this program to do a little extra spring cleaning.”
The event is part of a broader national effort to address the growing concern of prescription drug abuse, as well as to protect the environment.
Improper disposal methods, such as flushing drugs down the toilet or throwing them in the trash, can lead to health and safety risks, including water contamination and drug abuse.
The Take-Back Day offers a secure way to dispose of medicines without such concerns.
Participants will not be required to provide any identification, and law enforcement will not ask questions about the medications being surrendered.
However, they are advised to remove any personal information from the packaging before disposal.
Since the DRBA first participated in the DEA’s Take-Back initiative in 2010, it has collected over 3,700 pounds of medication.
This year’s event is expected to continue that positive impact by giving the public an easy, anonymous way to dispose of unwanted drugs safely.

Great Lakes Gun Rights and Michigan Open Carry, Inc. filed a lawsuit in April 2023 in an attempt to halt mandatory background checks for the purchase of firearms, as well as other procedures, that were proposed following the February 2023 mass shooting on Michigan State University’s campus that killed three students and critically injured five others.
The lawsuit was filed the same day Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law legislation mandating background checks for all firearm purchases in the state and that all guns be stored safely in homes where minors could access the weapons. 
A Michigan Court of Claims judge determined in November of that year that while the state House had violated the open meetings law, by failing to “enact adequate rules regarding the right to address committees,” the injunction requested by the groups was not warranted and dismissed the suit.
In an opinion issued Tuesday, the appellate court upheld the Court of Claims decision, agreeing that the Legislature’s acceptance of both oral and written communications during the overall hearing process satisfied open meetings law requirements.

“The sole issue before us in this case is whether the trial court erred by deciding that ‘the Legislature intended to allow the public’s right to address public bodies under the OMA to be satisfied through oral and written submissions.’ We conclude that it did not,” said the opinion.
As for the OMA violations, which involved a failure by the House Judiciary Committee to have clear rules outlining who gets to testify in-person and for how long, the appeals panel noted the committee later adopted a rule in February 2024 that mirrored that of its Senate counterpart, bringing it into line with the OMA.
Following the opinion’s release, both Great Lakes Gun Rights and Michigan Open Carry, Inc. denounced the finding, saying it signaled a “chilling erosion of transparency and accountability in Lansing.”
Casey Armitage, president of Michigan Open Carry, Inc., said the ruling was a further attempt to “muzzle” gun owners.
“This isn’t just about meetings—it’s about our right to stand up and say ‘no’ to gun control in person, not just on some ignored scrap of paper. This decision emboldens every anti-gun politician to shut out the people they’re supposed to serve,” said Armitage in a statement posted to social media.
Both groups vowed to explore all avenues, including “legal challenges, legislative pressure, and grassroots mobilization” to reverse the decision, according to the statement.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 13:19:56.431331

Bring penguins.
That’s what the staff at the Florida Aquarium in Tampa did Wednesday, bringing four penguins to the Capitol for lawmakers, staff, and reporters to get a glimpse of.
It brought attention to the budget appropriation made by Tampa Republican Rep. Karen Gonzalez Pittman in the House and Tampa Bay-area Republican Danny Burgess in the Senate for $1 million for the aquarium’s storm and flood protection project, which is designed to provide total perimeter protection for  animal habitats and life-support systems against wind and flood damage.
“Because we are building and investing in this large outdoor habitat, for not only our African penguins but we’ll have California sea lions out there as well, with all the recent impacts from the hurricanes that we had this past fall, we’re really looking forward to being able to have a more resilient outdoor space, so we’re seeking funding for a seawall that will protect us during those times,” said Emily Vazir, development coordinator at the Florida Aquarium.
That project is just part of the $45 million expansion that the aquarium has been working on since 2023 and expects to complete in 2026.
Archibold, or Archi, was on display at Senate Majority Leader Jim Byrd’s office on Wednesday. At 4 years old, Archi is the youngest penguin in the aquarium colony, according to Vazir. There are nine at the facility. Three other penguins accompanied Archi in making the visit to the Capitol.

HB 437, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, would require the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to develop a system to send wireless alerts about unprovoked shark attacks or after a “credible report” of shark activity that may pose an “imminent threat” to beachgoers in Mobile or Baldwin counties.
“It will set up a system, like an Amber Alert, that will be geofenced, when there has been a previous shark attack, an unprovoked shark attack near a coastline,” Faulkner told members of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday.  said to members of the committee. “And it will allow professionals, emergency management, people who are in the business of doing this, for them to be able to send a notice. It puts a tool in the toolbox.”
The bill is named for Lulu Gribbin, a 16-year-old from Mountain Brook who was attacked by a shark last year while swimming off a beach in Florida, losing an arm and a leg in the process.
Gribbin underwent months of intensive care and rehabilitation and founded a foundation called “Lulu Strong” to advocate for prosthetic technologies for people with amputated limbs.
“Since then, I have had so many opportunities and my life has changed completely,” Gribbin told the committee on Wednesday. “With this bill in place, we can prevent further accidents in the future, and I am so excited to be able to pass it.”
The system will be activated in case of a triggering event, such as “a confirmed report of an unprovoked shark attacking an individual.” It may also be activated if the Conservation receives a report of the presence of a shark in the area posing a danger to potential swimmers nearby. The Legislative Services Agency did not have an estimate of the cost of the system.
Shark attacks are generally rare. According to the Georgia Aquarium, there are only 60 to 65 unprovoked shark attacks around the world each year, with only about six of those being fatal. By comparison, the National Safety Council said 1,039 Alabamians died in automobile accidents in 2022. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 1,278 Alabamians died by firearms in 2022.
Faulkner’s bill follows a congressional bill filed by U.S. Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama in honor of Gribbin that would alert people at a beach to their phones if a shark attack had taken place recently.
The bill moves to the House of Representatives for further consideration.

(Photo:  Jerod MacDonald-Evoy / Arizona Mirror)The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix, Arizona Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights, and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.

The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

Unfortunately, Delaware Humanities has announced the closure of its grant application process. The change comes in direct response to federal budget cuts ordered by DOGE, which were implemented last week.

Humanities councils across the country, including Delaware Humanities, received notice of these cuts through emails and letters sent on the early morning of April 3rd notifying them of the termination of funding, effective April 1st.
As Delaware’s state affiliate of the NEH, Delaware Humanities relies on federal funding to support its programming. The recent DOGE-led reductions to the NEH budget have been substantial, forcing the organization to suspend all current and future grant cycles.
DOGE, a federal agency created to streamline government operations, has  slashed budgets across numerous agencies, including an estimated 80% staffing cut at the NEH and the cancellation of more than 1,200 grants nationwide. 
“We want to be clear: this situation is unusual and unprecedented,” Delaware Humanities wrote in a statement.
Despite the cuts, Delaware Humanities affirmed its ongoing commitment to its mission:
“As we navigate these abrupt changes, we are evaluating the next steps on how to best support our partners. However, we will remain steadfast in our mission to strengthen our communities by connecting Delawareans through the diversity of human experiences.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/unnamed-2-e1744213799725.png,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

HB 234, sponsored by Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, passed the House of Representatives 58-30 in March. The legislation would require public school employees who are around students to be equipped with an emergency button. It also mandates regular training for employees with the technology.
“We’ve heard the expressions like every second counts time equals lives. These are expressions that are often heard in crisis and emergency incidents,” Baker said. “With this mobile rapid response technology in place, if this bill passes, then teachers, administrators, office, staff, custodians, lunchroom workers, maintenance and other education employees become the eyes and ears, internally and externally across the school campus to activate an alert that immediately notifies school officials and law enforcement of the exact location for the most rapid response to the incident.”

An amendment that would extend the implementation time of the technology on the condition of additional funding specifically for school public safety starting in 2030 was adopted unanimously by the Senate Education Policy Committee.  
“That actually sort of extends it possibly even beyond that, if there is not annual dedicated funding for school safety,” Baker said.
Baker said the technology would improve response times with first responders receiving the exact location of the emergency. Baker said on the House floor in March that an emergency is not limited to a shooting threat, but could also be used for a medical emergency.
Most of the concerns toward the bill in the House revolved around whether schools had the resources to install and maintain the technology. 
Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, said he is concerned about the legislation not addressing the root of the issue of safety in schools. He said there is a lack of discipline in the home that leads to safety issues at schools.
“We continually address these issues of school safety, and I’m 100% for that, but my concern is that we never seem to really address the reasons that we have these issues,” Stutts said. 
The bill will now be considered by the full Senate.

Daniel Grossberg has gained a second primary challenger for his seat in the state legislature. 
Cassie Lyles, a high school teacher in Jefferson County Public Schools, announced her candidacy for the 30th House District Tuesday. The primary will be held in May 2026. 
“For years, I’ve been in the classroom, on the front lines, shaping young minds and ensuring that every student has the opportunity to succeed,” Lyles said in a press release. “Now, it’s time to take that passion to a broader level. Teachers see first-hand how the decisions made in Frankfort affect Kentucky’s kids and families. Everything affecting our communities walks into our classrooms as well.  We need more educators in office, and I am ready to step up.”
Lyles kicked off her campaign during a Tuesday event at the Jefferson County Teachers Association office where she was introduced by Kentucky AFL-CIO President Dustin Reinstedler and former U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth. Lyles aims to make “future of public education, workers rights, the needs of her community” a focus of her campaign.

Grossberg faced no opponent in the 2024 general election after narrowly winning his primary. However, prominent Kentucky Democrats, including Gov. Andy Beshear and House Democratic Caucus members, said Grossberg should resign following Lexington Herald-Leader investigations that detailed allegations of inappropriate behavior from Grossberg, including receiving a lifetime ban from a Louisville strip club after inappropriately touching a dancer and instances of alleged sexual harassment toward women in Kentucky politics. The Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission has opened investigations into allegations against Grossberg.
Grossberg has repeatedly denied the allegations and vowed to remain in office.

Laura Kelly's vetoes, but also needs to complete work on annual public school funding legislation.","A deputy commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education informed members of the Kansas State Board of Education the 2025 Legislature has yet to approve collection of an estimated $875 million in property taxes to fund public education statewide in 2025-2026. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Board of Education livestream)TOPEKA — The Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature returns to work Thursday after neglecting to perform during the regular part of the 2025 session an annual obligation to affirm collection of $875 million in property taxes to finance public schools statewide.
It’s assumed by education administrators and advocates the wrap-up portion of the legislative session — typically reserved for attempts to override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly — would allow time for passage of a bill clarifying the 2025-2026 funding picture for school districts serving more than 450,000 students throughout the state.
“Unless they fix that this week, that’s an $875 million hole in next year’s budget,” said Frank Harwood, deputy commissioner of fiscal and administrative services at the Kansas State Department of Education.
He said the Legislature could take advantage of the brief end-of-session window to address a bill triggering collection of 20 mills in property tax for public schools. State law requires every school district levy a 20-mill tax on property in their district to help finance public education. This money didn’t stay in the taxing district, but was sent to the state to create the pool of money to fund all districts.
“If this doesn’t get dealt with, we’re going to be coming back for a special session,” said Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Democrat from Overland Park.
Without the property tax levy, the Legislature would have to replace the revenue with an appropriation from the general treasury or reduce funding to public school districts.
The Legislature risked running afoul of Kansas Supreme Court decisions in the Gannon case that resulted from a finding the Legislature failed to abide by the Kansas Constitution in terms of funding a suitable education for children.
Meanwhile, a second education budget issue emerged regarding the Legislature’s decision to designate $1.25 million for public schools and $250,000 to private schools for CPR training and to acquire defibrillator or AED equipment.
The appropriation, inspired by survival of an Emporia teenager who suffered cardiac arrest, would be drawn from an anticipated increase in base-aid school funding. This category of K-12 funding was adjusted annually based on changes in the Midwest version of the consumer price index for urban consumers or CPI-U.
Leah Fliter, assistant executive director of the Kansas Association of School Boards, said CPI-U funding was to be directed to public education, but the state budget presented to the governor directed a portion to private schools.
Fliter said the school board association wasn’t opposed to state spending for training or equipment to address cardiac emergencies in private schools, but suggested lawmakers ought to select a funding source other than CPI-U aid for public education.
“We are very concerned about that taking of CPI funding for AEDs,” she said.
Harwood, the deputy commissioner at the state Department of Education, said questions had been raised about constitutionality of the $250,000 appropriation to private schools.
“Because most of the private schools are parochial, it may actually be a violation of the Constitution because state aid can’t go to parochial schools,” Harwood said.
The Legislature scheduled work sessions Thursday and Friday in anticipation the governor would issue vetoes. As of Tuesday, Kelly had vetoed 10 bills approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature. The governor has been working through the state budget bill and could make line-item vetoes.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kansas-board-of-education-2-1024x567.png,,,2025-04-09 12:23:50.902520

Michelle Lujan Grisham's decision to deploy the National Guard to Albuquerque to help with public safety issues,"Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham discussed her executive order deploying the National Guard to Albuquerque with reporters at an April 8, 2025 event in Santa Fe to pick up trash on Cerrillos Road (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s executive order deploying the National Guard to help the Albuquerque Police Department amounts to “a show of force, not a show of solutions,” ACLU New Mexico policy advocate Daniel Williams said in a statement released by the organization on Tuesday afternoon.
The governor had announced the deployment earlier that day in a news release that cited an emergency request from the Albuquerque Police noting the fentanyl epidemic and rising violent juvenile crime “as critical issues requiring immediate intervention.” According to the governor’s office, between 60 and 70 National Guard personnel will be deployed to Albuquerque starting in mid-May, following training that has already begun under the supervision of the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security, Department of Public Safety, State Police and APD. The governor’s office said Central Avenue and other specific corridors would receive particular focus.
In remarks to reporters Tuesday afternoon in the midst of a clean-up event on Cerrillos Road in Santa Fe, the governor said those areas were chosen “based on call volumes, arrests and risk.” She noted that any Albuquerque who drives through downtown has seen the crime in the area.
“I see drug dealing, drug use, prostitution,” she said. “I worry about human trafficking…if we don’t…do appropriate, fair interventions, you get to a place where you can’t get neighborhoods safe for the people who live there. It’s not fair to the people who are driving to and from work, and the people who live there. Frankly, it’s not fair to the whole city.”
The governor emphasized that the National Guard would not be engaged in direct policing but, rather, in support roles, such as transportation to hospitals, additional security and medical assistance.
Only a “very select number of National Guard” would be in a position to do direct policing, she said. “It’s the military police,” Lujan Grisham said. “They don’t have a relationship with anyone in those communities…so that can create more risk, not less.” The “best thing they can do,” she added, “is to allow the folks who know that area, who can get that work done in a much more coordinated, direct environment, to let them to do their job quickly.”
In its news release, ACLU-NM expressed concern that “militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations and further criminalize homelessness rather than address the root causes of public safety issues.”
Williams’ statement, moreover, said Lujan Grisham’s “past policy proposals too often have centered on efforts to criminalize and institutionalize unhoused New Mexicans, without a commensurate emphasis on solving the root causes of crime. New Mexicans should be confident that their governor is truly working to keep them safe, not doubling down on failed strategies that will fuel mass incarceration and multiply the harms our communities already endure. In a state so heavily impacted by police violence, the answer to safety cannot and will not be found in increased police presence, especially not through collaboration with the military.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1180-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-09 11:12:17.702207

Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker. 
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration. 
Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process. 
And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

(Courtesy of Glenda Nixon)Anti-Trump protests are nothing new. They’ve been occurring with regularity in America, and I’ve been attending them here in Rapid City, ever since Donald Trump’s first election in 2016. So I was expecting all of the usual suspects, and about the usual response when I went to the Hands Off protest last weekend here that was part of a larger national movement. A protest in Rapid City, or anywhere in South Dakota, usually means a gathering of not more than a couple hundred people whose actions go largely unnoticed by the rest of the state.
This one felt, if not exactly new, at least different.
For starters, there was not one, but two, rallies in Rapid City on Saturday. Both of them were larger and more enthusiastic than past rallies have been. There were better signs, more encouraging honking from passing motorists and, most significantly, what appeared to be a wider, broader base of angry voters. Most of the vitriol was reserved for President Trump, of course, but there was plenty left over for South Dakota’s congressional delegation.
Crowd size is difficult to estimate, but I’m guessing perhaps a thousand people stretched out along Omaha Street at Rapid City’s Founders Park on Saturday morning for the Hands Off event. At noon, a second rally had begun a bit farther east in front of City Hall, where a similar sized crowd — no doubt many of the same protesters — continued their anti-Trump messaging at a 50501 event. Protests occurred across the state, in cities including Pierre, Brookings, Aberdeen, Mitchell and Watertown. In Sioux Falls, thousands of people showed up, to the surprise of protesters and observers alike.
Thousands gather in Sioux Falls to protest Trump’s actions

In Rapid City, there were plenty of signs telling President Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to keep their “Hands Off!” of schools, libraries, feeding programs, Medicare, Social Security, voting rights, free speech, health care, transgender kids, democracy, federal employees, gay rights, the courts, reproductive rights … and on, and on, and on. The Hands Off list was as long as the flurry of executive orders issued by Trump in the first few weeks of his presidency. I especially liked the “You Can’t Spell Felon without Elon” sign and the many inventive reinterpretations of the MAGA acronym, such as “Morons Are Governing America.” One of my personal favorites was a sign carried not by a person at all, but affixed to a fluffy little dog that read, “Good DOG; Bad DOGE.”
There were also plenty of signs letting South Dakota’s congressional delegation know what protesters think of them. What they think is that Sen. John Thune, Sen. Mike Rounds and Rep. Dusty Johnson are complicit in Trump’s blatant disregard for federal workers, his dismantling of federal agencies and his abandonment of democratic norms.
Photos of the three incumbent Republicans appeared on numerous signs that were critical of Congress for conceding its power to Trump’s executive branch, with slogans like: “Anybody Here Seen Our Old Friends?” “Can You Tell Me Where They’ve Gone?” “Do Your Jobs!” “Support Democracy, not Fascism.” “History Will Remember Your Complicity.”
While the three men could not escape the creativity of the rally signs, it remains to be seen if they will manage to escape angry voters at the ballot box. South Dakota is a very red state, after all, and they have all cruised to easy election victories in the past. But we are also a state with a rich history of showing longtime incumbent politicians the door once voters decide an elected official has become more responsive to the powers-that-be in Washington, D.C., than to South Dakotans. Even many Trump voters may eventually decide they’ve had their fill of tariff trade wars and stock market losses. Some of them, likely some of the federal employees carrying AFGE signs supporting the American Federation of Government Employees last Saturday, already have. Thune, Rounds and Johnson would be wise to consider them.
Back on Jan. 25, I went to a March for Democracy in Rapid City, just days after President Trump’s second inauguration. It all felt futile that day, and I bemoaned to two friends in the crowd, “What is it we’re doing here … again?” Perhaps the small crowd and the lack of enthusiasm we felt that day could be blamed on the freezing temperatures and the bitter cold wind. But it was clear that we were also feeling the dispiriting chill of another four years of a Trump presidency and what it meant for our country.
Fast forward two months, and the protest climate in Rapid City felt different to me. Maybe that was nothing more than last weekend’s sunshine and the spring-like temperatures, but I suspect there is something else heating up voters all across America.

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy /Arizona Mirror)The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.

“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.

New-York based Undue Medical Debt recently announced it eliminated $219 million in medical debt in Connecticut as part of a deal with Pendrick Capital Partners, a third-party debt buyer.
The debt was owed by people living at or below 400% of the federal poverty level or for whom medical debt was 5% or more of their annual income.
Had the deal not been reached, the debts would have been sold to a for-profit collection agency and patients would have been pursued for the outstanding balances and potentially placed on payment plans.
“Most of that debt was in Florida and Texas, who have not expanded Medicaid,” said Allison Sesso, Undue’s president and CEO.
While Medicaid expansions have protected Connecticut patients from medical expenses, the state is not immune to rising health care costs.
Connecticut lawmakers dedicated $6.5 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds last year to partner with Undue to buy medical debt for pennies on the dollar. In December, the state worked with the group to erase an additional $30 million of medical debt for patients. Connecticut aims to erase $650 million in medical debt for residents by 2026.
In addition to state governments, Undue is funded by philanthropist MacKenzie Scott.
Sixty percent of the medical debt relief in the $30 billion deal goes toward non-Medicaid expansion states. The average amount erased was $1,100 per patient, with Texas, Florida, California (expanded Medicaid), Georgia and Oklahoma (expanded Medicaid) having the highest amounts of medical debt.
Local solutions to a national problem
Nearly 1 in 12 adults in the U.S. owe medical debt, according to KFF.
An estimated 280,000 people in Connecticut reported having medical debt in a given year, according to Peterson-KFF. A KFF poll shows people with medical debt reported cutting back on food, clothing, and other household items, and took on additional debts.
“Medical debt is not the result of poor financial decisions — it is the result of a health care system where many families are just one accident or one bad diagnosis away from ruined credit and all that comes with it,” said Sen. Matt Lesser (D-Middletown), co-chair of the Human Services Committee.
In 2024, Lesser helped to pass legislation to ban credit reporting on medical debt. The bill seeks to help patients apprehensive about seeking medical care out of fear of acquiring debt.
Connecticut was “one of the nine states that has banned credit reporting of medical debt, so you should pat yourselves on the back for that,” Sesso said.
“There’s also been some discussion about financial assistance policies for patients, and you should continue to go down that path,” Sesso said.
Senate Bill 1192 would require the Office of the Healthcare Advocate (OHA) to develop an online hospital financial assistance portal for patients and family members. Senate Bill 1469 seeks to protect spouses from inheriting medical debt from their partners.

The Judiciary 1 Committee voted in favor of House Bill 549 after presentations from sponsor Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus), the second-ranked Republican in the House, and Kirk O’Steen, the director of government affairs for the state auditor’s office. It will now head to the Committee on State and Local Government for further debate.
The bill expands the auditor’s investigative powers to encompass any entity receiving state or federal funds, requiring the office to pursue any reports of “improper governmental activities” among those agencies, their employees, and any individuals who receive public funds — including fraud, misappropriation and waste of public resources, and violation of state or federal laws.
If enacted, the auditor’s office would also receive “continuous and unrestricted access” to any databases, datasets, and digital records deemed necessary for investigations, allowing the auditor to seek a court order if access is not provided. The bill also exempts the state auditor’s office from a number of statutory requirements, including legislation around the use of information technology and the North Carolina State Human Resources Act — a level of independence Jones said is similar to that of the General Assembly and the state courts.
Jones said in introducing the bill that it was largely directed by State Auditor Dave Boliek’s staff, telling lawmakers, “it’s not my dog, I’m just walking it.” He said the additional powers were crucial for improving government accountability and transparency.
“It strengthens the auditor’s independence, ensuring the office can do its job without red tape or delays or interference from other branches of government,” Jones said. “It allows the auditor to better follow the money by clarifying the ability to investigate individuals and organizations that receive state or federal funds.”

The bill comes amid a substantial increase in the state auditor’s authority after the office flipped from Democratic to Republican in the 2024 election, the only Council of State office to do so. The House committee action came on the same day the state Senate approved a measure to establish a new team in the same office to scrutinize state spending and job openings. Lawmakers also gave Boliek’s office administrative authority over the State Board of Elections and the ability to make appointments to it just weeks after the election, though the law is currently being challenged in state court.
Rep. Brandon Lofton (D-Mecklenburg) raised concerns about the breadth of the new definition for “state agencies,” calling the bill’s proposal to open up any entity that receives state funds to the auditor’s full scrutiny “broad and onerous.”
“Any church that receives any grants, any factory that receives state incentives, any hospital or farm that receives subsidies, any private school that receives voucher money — all these entities, no matter how much money they receive, are now subject to these requirements,” Lofton said. “That means that any of these entities would have to subject themselves to the auditor having continuous and unrestricted view of databases, data sets and digital records.”
O’Steen, the auditor’s office staffer, said the bill’s intention is to be able to track any public funds that are issued and “follow the money.” He said the bill’s primary purpose is to “clarify” the auditor’s power rather than expand it, as the office already has “ample authority” for conducting investigations and audits.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said she found the bill’s provision around investigating any individuals who receive state funds to be excessive, noting that it opens up anyone receiving money for Hurricane Helene relief for auditing. O’Steen said those are the sorts of funds that the auditor’s office should be following.
“As far as going after individuals, it’s not the intention of the auditor’s office. Even if it was, there’s no capacity to go that deep into individuals. That’s not the intention or the vision of the Auditor,” O’Steen said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240430_163039-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-04-09 10:07:10.078532

Sharice Davids of Kansas is introducing a bill to reverse a Trump administration freeze on Title X funding for family planning clinics.,"U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas, said she would introduce legislation in the U.S. House to restore and shield funding to Title X family planning clinics that was halted by the administration of  President Donald Trump. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas endorsed the introduction of legislation to increase and protect funding to the federal family planning safety-net program after the Trump administration withheld millions of dollars for reproductive health clinics.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the pause in distribution of appropriated Title X funding allowed for investigation of possible violation of federal laws or executive orders. The review included compliance with Trump’s ban on promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policy.
“In Kansas and across the country, people are being turned away from the only places they can afford to get basic, lifesaving reproductive care — all because the Trump administration is playing politics with their health,” said Davids, a Democrat serving the 3rd District in eastern Kansas.
“This bill protects trusted providers and ensures access to cancer screenings, birth control and STI testing, no matter your income, where you live or how you vote,” she said.
The proposed Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would deliver federal funding to help sustain clinics serving an estimated 4 million people annually. In 2023, more than 1.5 million visits to Planned Parenthood health centers were made possible by the program.
Under the U.S. House bill ready for introduction Wednesday, annual federal funding for Title X would be shielded from Republican efforts to eliminate the program. The bill would deliver $512 million annually for 10 years and address the current funding shortfall. The proposal also would allocate $50 million for clinic construction, renovations and infrastructure improvements.
Davids said the legislation would protect Planned Parenthood from being excluded from federal appropriations by the Trump administration.
The bill would reinstate federal regulations prohibiting discrimination against providers of Title X services, while ensuring comprehensive, affordable reproductive health care for patients regardless of income, race, immigration status or gender. It would make certain information and services related to prenatal care, delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption and pregnancy termination were provided.
The Guttmacher Institute, which works to protect sexual and reproductive health and rights, estimated the freeze by HHS could impact access to health care for up to 1.25 million people, many of whom had modest incomes, were people of color or lived in medically underserved communities.
“Data shows that restrictions appearing to target one type of reproductive health care have ripple effects on all aspects of reproductive care, including abortion and contraception,” said Kelly Baden, vice president of public policy at the Guttmacher Institute.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250228_davids-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 10:07:10.078532

Trump-appointed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the closure of five of the nation’s 12 regional offices, as part of an agency-wide consolidation that included cutting 10,000 employees. That included closing the Seattle-based Region 10 office serving Alaska, Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. 
The office was a critical resource for Alaska Head Start programs, for grant administration and compliance, said Katrina Ahlfield, executive director for Kids’ Corps Inc., an Anchorage Head Start program. She also serves on the board of the Alaska Head Start Association.
“​​Thousands of children and families potentially are impacted in the longer term,” she said of the closures nationwide. “If this creates a delay in grant processing, or programs receiving the immediate support that they might need.”
The federal department did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Head Start provides early learning programs through schools and nonprofits that serve children from low-income families, from supporting pregnant mothers up to age 5. Foster youth, families who receive supplemental assistance like food benefits, and those who are experiencing homelessness are automatically eligible. 
“We’re looking at some of the most vulnerable children and families in Alaska,” Ahlfield said.
Ahlfield said Kids’ Corps Inc. is one of four Head Start programs impacted directly, currently serving 1,076 children.
Ahlfield said the Alaska Head Start Association heard the news of the regional office closure on March 31 second-hand, and had no direct notice or further direction from federal officials. 
That day, federal staff arrived to work in Seattle and were locked out, according to news reports, and staff were placed on immediate administrative leave until June, without warning.
With that office closed, Ahlfield said there’s a loss in administrative and technical support. 
“They were your experts really on the Head Start performance standards and all of the compliance requirements that come along with operating any federal program,” she said. “So they were kind of your go-to as a director, or go-to for technical assistance and questions. They also help to process your grant applications.”
While there are no immediate cuts or closures, she said the loss of administrative support impacts her organization, as well as and also CCS Early Learning in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Thrivalaska in Fairbanks, and the Rural Alaska Community Program, or RuralCap, which serves children and families throughout Alaska. 
Ahlfield said regional administrators would answer questions, or give advice related to health and safety requirements. 
“These people had worked there for, you know, over 10 years, and really knew our programs well, and knew Alaska well,” she said. 
“So right now, we don’t have anyone to contact about any of those kinds of questions or needs,” she added. 
Kids Corps Inc. serves 189 children in the Anchorage area, and Ahlfield said she’s most concerned about their pending grant funding, which she expects to cover costs for the next six months. 
“My most urgent concern is, is this going to create a delay in programs receiving grant approvals and funding on time in order to be able to continue providing services without a temporary, you know, delay and or needing to temporarily close?” she said. 
She said there have not been Head Start funding delays reported in Alaska yet. But the uncertainty is difficult; any program cuts or closures would hit families and staff hard. 
“We have an early-childhood and an educator crisis, where we don’t have enough people in the field already,” she said. “And so it just makes the situation worse for people. It definitely has the potential to create hard times.”
Alaska Head Start receives $68 million in federal funding each year, she said, with a 20% match totaling $13 million provided by the state through the Alaska Department of Early Education and Childhood Development. DEED provides state grants to 17 Head Start programs across the state, in classroom and home-based settings. 
DEED did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. 
Ahlfield said Head Start administrators and communities are calling on the Alaska congressional delegation to urge the Trump administration to reverse the cuts, or provide a clear plan. 
“If it’s not possible to reinstate our regional office, and that would be our first preference, … then we really need and want a well communicated, coordinated plan on how this is going to work, so that it doesn’t impact these vital services,” she said.

On Jan. 7, one day after Congress certified President Donald Trump’s election victory, Gregory Bovino sent 65 of his Border Patrol agents into Kern County. Bovino is the head of the El Centro sector in the Imperial Valley, but the raid agents conducted that day occurred a six-hour drive north of the border.
Bovino said that before setting off for Kern County, his agents had a “predetermined list of targets,” many of whom had immigration and criminal records. At the end of what Border Patrol named “Operation Return to Sender,” the agency said it arrested 78 people.
But an investigation by CalMatters’ Sergio Olmos and Wendy Fry, in partnership with Evident and Bellingcat, found that officials misrepresented the very basics of their immigration raid. Data obtained from U.S. Customs and Border Protection reveal that Border Patrol had no prior knowledge of criminal or immigration history for 77 of the 78 people arrested. 
Last month the ACLU sued Border Patrol on behalf of United Farm Workers, arguing that the agency detained people without reasonable suspicion, and then deprived them of due process by forcing them to sign self-deportation paperwork.

Casey Creamer, CEO of California Citrus Mutual, an association of Bakersfield citrus growers: “If they’re targeting a rural operation like this, people that are getting up early in the morning to work, those aren’t drug dealers.”

But to Bovino, there is no difference between going after undocumented field workers or drug dealers.

Bovino: “If you’re an illegal alien, you’re getting it. A fentanyl dealer, you get it.”

Federal cuts poised to undermine CA mental health treatment

Under a backdrop of rising opioid-related deaths, Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2023 laid out a plan to revamp the state’s behavioral health system. But as California begins to make headway addressing its behavioral health crisis, proposed cuts to Medicaid cast a big question mark over the future of these changes.
As CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra explains, Newsom’s plan to pour billions of dollars into new services and support programs includes increasing the number of treatment beds, training new mental health workers and other changes.
The state draws from multiple sources to fund these endeavors, with Medicaid playing a key role: California spends about $161 billion on Medicaid, most of which comes from the federal government. Millions of Californians use Medicaid to access therapy and medication, and the program helps pay for some social support services that help the most vulnerable patients secure housing and food. 
But last month GOP members in the U.S. House of Representatives approved a federal budget proposal to eliminate $880 billion in spending over the next 10 years from the committee that oversees Medicaid. That proposal necessitates cuts from Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and the proposal cuts from those areas in order to preserve tax cuts Trump made in 2017 that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. 
In March the department that oversees the state’s Medicaid program also received termination letters from the federal Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration that rescinded $120 million in behavioral health grants intended to help reduce overdose deaths at the state and local level.

Trump tariffs hurt CA pension funds

Following the stock market’s $11 trillion wipeout last week due to Trump’s newly imposed tariffs, concerns about California’s already underfunded pension funds for state workers and teachers are under renewed focus, writes CalMatters’ Adam Ashton.
The nation’s largest and second largest public pension fund — the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), respectively — hold more than $800 billion in assets and serve millions of Californians.
In the first two days following Trump’s April 2 issuance of the tariffs, CalPERS lost about $15 billion. As of market close on Monday, it has since lost roughly $23 billion with a total market value of $508 billion. CalSTRS updates its portfolio numbers once a month, and it’s likely to have experienced losses at a similar rate to CalPERS.
Though CalSTRS Chief Investment Officer Scott Chan warned the board last month that policy changes under the Trump administration could cause “unprecedented” and “world changing” risks, both pension funds have emphasized that their diverse portfolios aren’t solely reliant on the stock market. 
Still, the funds must meet their annual investment targets, which is 6.8% for CalPERS and 7% for CalSTRS. If they are missed, government agencies will have to pay more to fund the pensions.

The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is facing a funding crisis that has hampered efforts to repair an aging network of about 1,100 miles of levees that protect the region — and roughly a half a million people — from floods. Learn more from CalMatters’ Alastair Bland.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: The deadly January wildfires and the Medi-Cal budget gap are already expected to strain California’s budget, but Trump’s tariffs could put further pressure on the state’s finances.
The new CEO of the California High-Speed Rail Authority has an aggressive, credible plan to accelerate construction, but the project needs serious commitment from the Legislature to secure stable funding, writes Ray LaHood, the U.S. transportation secretary from 2009-2013 and the co-chair of the U.S. High-Speed Rail coalition.

These earthen berms, mostly on private land, could rupture and endanger half a million people and flood thousands of acres of farmland.","In summary
The Delta faces a funding crisis to repair and maintain an aging network of 1,100 miles of levees. These earthen berms, mostly on private land, could rupture and endanger half a million people and flood thousands of acres of farmland.



As winter storms soaked California in early 2023, the Sacramento River swelled toward flood stage. Levees protecting large expanses of farmland and many towns sprung leaks. At one site, response crews drove metal sheets into the earthen berm and lined the levee face with heavy rock.
The work cost almost $700,000, paid by local farmers who had to take out a loan. 
“It was way beyond our means, but we had to do it,” said Daniel Wilson, a farmer near the Delta town of Walnut Grove and trustee of the management agency responsible for the levee. 
Because the region was declared a disaster zone, funding help was available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But two years later, the money still hasn’t arrived. Other districts in the region also are waiting for reimbursements. 
The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is facing a funding crisis that has bogged down efforts to repair and maintain an aging network of about 1,100 miles of levees that protect the region from floods. 
These protective ridges of dirt and rocks, mostly on private land, are at growing risk of rupturing, which would endanger half a million people, mostly in Stockton but also in smaller towns and farmsteads. Also threatened are thousands of acres of farmland, highways and water supply pumps that send water to much of the state. 
The summer of 2004 saw a major failure when the privately owned levee surrounding a large parcel of farmers’ fields called Jones Tract, which mostly sits below sea level, burst. Water surged through the break, flooding 12,000 acres, which remained swamped for months. Dozens of barns and a few homes were submerged. The response and repair effort — including rebuilding hundreds of feet of levee and pumping out the water — cost $90 million in government and private funding.
More recently, last year, water seeped under a levee that rings Victoria Island west of Stockton, just a few miles north of pumping stations that send water to 30 million Californians and vast tracts of farmland. A breach would have created powerful suction, drawing in large volumes of brackish San Francisco Bay water and forcing the pumps to shut down for weeks. Crews drove sheet piles deep into the levee to stem the leak and stop the flow of water under the levee.
Without substantial improvements to Delta levees in the next 25 years, “more than $10 billion in agricultural, residential, commercial, and infrastructure assets and nearly $2 billion in annual economic activity would be exposed to flooding,” according to an estimate from the Delta Stewardship Council. 
Jeffrey Mount, a geomorphologist and water infrastructure expert with the Public Policy Institute of California, said the recent near-miss at Victoria Island could be a harbinger of more dangerous levee breaks to come.
“That is considered one of the really good levees, and they nearly lost it,” Mount said. “So what about the other ones?”
With state and federal assistance programs falling behind on reimbursements or losing funding, landowners are struggling to keep pace with maintenance. Many are in debt from recent projects, and the backlog of upgrades and repairs is growing.
Billions of dollars are needed to upgrade the Delta’s levees to basic safety standards, but the estimated costs far exceed the funding metered out by state and federal agencies. 
Repairing Delta levees could cost at least $3.2 billion by 2050, according to the Delta Stewardship Council. State water officials estimate that about $1.06 billion is needed for Delta levee upgrades in just the next five years.
Across the entire Central Valley, the problem balloons to $30 billion in overdue upgrades to protect against worst-case scenario flooding, which could cause $1 trillion in damage, according to the state’s 2022 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan.
“All the districts in the Central Valley have a list of projects that they would like to get accomplished,” said Meegan Nagy, general manager of the Sacramento River West Side Levee District, which manages levees upstream of the state capital.
A few miles southeast of Sacramento, a privately owned levee system beside the Cosumnes River ruptured on New Year’s Eve in 2022 during a powerful downpour. The flooding killed three people, swamped homes, shut down Highway 99 and washed away vehicles. The local levee management agency, funded by its landowners, was reportedly still waiting for federal emergency relief money two years later and, as of January, still owed the bank $7 million.

Stockton, on the eastern edge of the Delta, faces a constant risk of flooding. U.S. Rep. Josh Harder, a Democrat from Tracy, said the problem stems from inadequate federal funding for levee upkeep and red tape that hinders maintenance and repairs by local agencies. He has co-authored a bill, the Safeguarding Our Levees Act, that would address some of these issues.
“For too long we’ve been left behind in federal funding,” Harder said. “No family should have to watch floodwater pour into their living room while government stalls.”
Parts of the region are essentially on borrowed time, with levees facing a uniquely overbearing workload, said Steven Deverel, a hydrologist at HydroFocus, Inc., who has studied Delta levees. 
Most levees, he explained, hold back water only during high flow events. But in the Delta, “levees are really more like dams in that they have to hold back water 24-7.” This unique arrangement makes much of the region particularly vulnerable to flooding. 
“You basically have holes in the ground as much as 25 feet deep, and the only thing that holds back the water is levees,” Mount said. 
Pumping the water out is increasingly expensive because of rising electricity rates, said engineer Gilbert Cosio with River Delta Consulting. 
“The last few years have been a perfect storm for expenditures,” he said. 
Landowners in debt for fixing levees
Since the 1970s, California has invested more than $700 million in Delta levee work. Just the last two budget cycles have dedicated $560 million to flood response and flood protection statewide, plus other investments, according to Laura Hollender, the California Department of Water Resources’ deputy director of flood management and dam safety. 
Still, Delta locals worry that critical programs protecting their region are being sidelined. The state cut a key levee maintenance fund from the budget this year.
The sluggish state reimbursements on cost-shared projects through the Delta Levees Maintenance Subventions Program leaves local landowners — who must front the costs of repairs — accruing interest on loans they can’t pay back. 
“It’s expensive and these districts go into debt to do these projects,” said Emily Pappalardo, an engineer with the local firm that designed and directed Wilson’s levee repair in 2023, DCC Engineering Co., in Walnut Grove. “Every dollar these districts spend should be on improving and maintaining their levees instead of chasing after the money to do it … or paying interest on loans.”
Wilson said that the FEMA reimbursement would not cover the costs of borrowing money to pay for the repairs. “The whole time the interest clock is ticking,” he said. That means less money for further levee upkeep. “If we had an issue this winter or last winter, we’d have been in a world of hurt,” Wilson said.

Until several years ago, according to sources, levee upgrades completed in the fall were followed by state reimbursements in the spring. “By the end of June, everyone had their money” in time to start working on spring and summer levee projects, said Cosio, at River Delta Consulting. “Now, it’s not until the fall or later that we get the money.” 
Farmer Harvey Correia, who has orchards near Isleton, said state claim filing requirements and slow processing mean that in some cases more than two years can pass before landowners are reimbursed.
“So we’re paying interest on loans while we’re waiting for money from the state,” Correia said.
Jason Ince, a spokesperson at the Department of Water Resources, said the agency strives to process payments “as quickly as possible” but said each request must be investigated and verified through site visits and coordination with other agencies.
Wilson, near Walnut Grove, said many local levee managers are financially swamped. “They’re in debt beyond their ability to pay it back.”
Pappalardo, who grew up in the Delta, wants to see more consistent funding of the levees subventions program. 
However, the program relies on periodic bond funding. The current cash pool amounts to about $14 million and derives from bonds that voters approved in 2014 and 2006, Ince said.
Late last year, voters approved Proposition 4, a $10 billion water, wildlife and climate bond, directing $150 million to Delta flood protection, levee upgrades and climate resiliency work. 
Sources said they expect it will provide more money for the program, but they emphasized that it, too, will run out.
“These levees aren’t going anywhere,” Pappalardo said. “This is infrastructure and these costs are always going to be here … this is general maintenance.” Ideally, she said, money would come from the state’s general fund. 
“How long does a politician hold memory of a disaster? Many say it’s six months, others say nine months … If we don’t have a flood event every year, we’re screwed.”Chris Neudeck, levee engineer
Also frustrated at the trickling pace of subventions funding for Delta levees is Stockton attorney Dante Nomellini, Jr., who has represented the Central Delta Water Agency and several Delta reclamation districts. He said the program is “well-oiled” but that its funding could be more reliable.
“The funding dries up every few years and we have to fight to get more,” he said.
Chris Neudeck, a levee engineer whose firm — Kjeldsen, Sinnock & Neudeck, Inc — repaired the Victoria Island breach this winter, believes the flagging funding for levees has a simple explanation:  
“It’s called the flood memory half-life,” he said. “How long does a politician hold memory of a disaster? Many say it’s six months, others say nine months … If we don’t have a flood event every year, we’re screwed.” 
An uncertain future for the Delta
Levee upgrades come in different forms. Some are relatively quick and easy, involving basic materials — like riprap, the rocks and boulders that line many levees — to provide armoring against erosion. 
Others are more sophisticated. One nearly finished project near the Delta town of Isleton, along Highway 160, builds in fish and bird habitat in the form of vegetated “benches” near the water line. 
“The benches serve a double purpose,” said Pappalardo, whose firm designed the project. “While they provide habitat, they also reduce the velocity of the river.”
Because Pappalardo’s project provides multiple benefits, the upgrade qualified for a 94% funding reimbursement from the state. But the total cost was about $18 million for 1.4 miles of levee, and the 6% that the reclamation district must cover on its own “is still a heavy lift for them,” Pappalardo said.

Though costly and tangled in thickets of program and agency acronyms, most levee upgrade projects are not terribly complicated. They often involve dump trucks dropping material on top of or down a slope of a levee. Barges can help. The goal in most projects is to build the levee, vertically and horizontally, to dimensions defined by several distinct standards. 
These federal and state standards call for a range of parameters in levee height, width and slope steepness. Among these standards is that of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers known as Public Law 84-99. Certain levees built to this standard are eligible for support from the Army Corps should they leak or break.   
Since 2019, the Flood Maintenance Assistance Program, enacted by the Department of Water Resources, has provided local levee maintenance agencies with $40 million to help their levees comply with the federal standard. 
This has leveraged massive amounts of federal funding when levees damaged by high waters need to be repaired, said Nagy at the Sacramento River West Side Levee District.
“In my district alone, since 2017, we have had about $30 million worth of federal funding for post-flood repairs,” Nagy said. The program “is one of the most successful programs the department has executed.” 
But the state’s Flood Maintenance Assistance Program was put “on hold” this year due to budget constraints, according to the Department of Water Resources. Nagy worries this could accelerate levee deterioration.  
“If we have multiple years when that program is not funded, then every year we get closer to losing eligibility for federal funding post-flood,” she said. 
“This is dirt and rock. If there was the political will, we could have the best levees west of the Mississippi.” Dante Nomellini, Jr., water agency attorney 
In an assessment of Delta levee vulnerability in 2016, Deverel and several coauthors wrote that although general compliance with various standards is “encouraging,” fully protecting any given island in the Delta “requires 100% compliance.”
Nomellini thinks full protection is achievable. “This is not rocket science,” he said. “This is dirt and rock. If there was the political will, we could have the best levees west of the Mississippi.” 
Mount said the amount of money needed to maintain the Delta’s levees may be the most insurmountable obstacle.
“What do you do if you don’t have the money?” he said. “What is the long-term vision for the Delta?”
At the Delta Stewardship Council, Jeff Henderson, deputy executive officer of planning and performance, said parts of the western Delta more exposed to the influence of tides and rising sea level may face an uncertain future.  
“In such locations, reinforcing levees may become technically or financially unsustainable over time, prompting conversations about alternative strategies,” Henderson said.   
“What do you do if you don’t have the money? What is the long-term vision for the Delta?”Jeffrey Mount, Public Policy Institute of California 
Erosion and weathering are just two factors gnawing at levee integrity. Burrowing beavers cause occasional collapses. So have invasive nutria, semi-aquatic rodents native to South America and now a recognized nuisance to California’s wetlands and levees. Toppling trees, too, can tear out the flank of a levee, and earthquakes are considered a constant danger — though just how serious is debated.
Another matter that has progressively compromised the Delta’s levees is subsidence — the land is sinking, an outcome of when peat soil is exposed to oxygen and breaks down, emitting carbon dioxide.
More than 2 billion cubic meters of Delta soil volume has disappeared since the 1850s, according to Deverel’s 2016 paper. Today, much cropland and scattered residences lie a precarious 15 to 20 feet and more below sea level. All the while, the ocean is rising, though slowly, and winter flooding is growing more extreme. 
“You have rising sea level, increasing winter storms and atmospheric rivers, and the longer it’s been since the last earthquake the closer we are to the next,” Mount said. 
He predicts that lower-value land will eventually go underwater as levees wear out and the will to maintain them wanes.
“Will the Delta look like this forever?” he asked. “The answer is no.”

The DACA recipient and Kansas father of three feared that he wouldn’t be able to return from Mexico, a country he left at the age of 4. His Roeland Park family embraced in a tearful and joyful reunion at Kansas City International airport.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection had stopped Cortez Martinez at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport more than two weeks ago, after he took a short trip to Mexico to visit his grandfather’s grave.
He was trying to return to Kansas City.
Instead, he was detained and questioned, then put back on a plane to Mexico City on March 23.
Cortez Martinez is a recipient of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
He had never been back to his birth nation, having been brought to the U.S. by his parents as a toddler. His farmworker father tended grapevines in California.
Prior to his scheduled trip to Mexico, Cortez Martinez had applied for and received permission to travel and return to the U.S., a process called “advance parole.”

His case is an example of an immigrant who “did everything the right way” and still ran into problems, said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, the Kansas City-based immigration attorney who filed a lawsuit April 2 on behalf of Cortez Martinez with the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas. The case, first reported by The Beacon, drew national attention.
“The lawsuit has been dismissed because you are home and that was really the point of the lawsuit,” Sharma-Crawford told her client at the airport.
The government had asked for time to respond, indicating that the issue could be resolved without the judge hearing the case, said Sharma-Crawford.
There seemed to be some confusion at the time when he was detained in Dallas, Cortez Martinez recalled, because a supervisor had been called over.
Still, Cortez Martinez said he was told that he’d been ordered removed in absentia on June 11, 2024, and that his documents allowing him to travel had been issued in error.
Cortez Martinez said he was never made aware of that order.
“I never got any notice,” he said. “I check everything because there is all of the paper that we get for DACA renewal.”
His current DACA is valid until October 2026.
Cortez Martinez will now have an opportunity to resolve the re-calendaring of removal proceedings in Kansas City’s immigration court, said Sharma-Crawford.
“I trust you,” Cortez Martinez said to Sharma-Crawford. “Let’s talk as soon as possible.”
His children carried a poster they’d made, each signing a note to their father.
They also brought mylar “Happy Birthday” balloons.
Cortez Martinez turned 40 while he was gone. Several other family members also had recent birthdays.
Laughing, Cortez Martinez hugged his wife and declared, “We’ll have one single party.”

Kennedy Jr. and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, one of Utah’s top legislative leaders said he is “excited” about the prospect of making Utah into a “national experiment.” 
During a news conference highlighting Kennedy and Zeldin’s visit to Utah on Monday to applaud a slate of “MAHA” bills the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature recently approved, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, told reporters that during their meetings state and federal officials also talked about the prospect of states taking over the management of a variety of federal programs. 
“We’d like to stand as a national experiment, allowing us … the state of Utah, to keep some of its federal dollars and tax dollars and run some programs,” Schultz said. 
Utah leaders want the state to be a “pilot project” to “help discontinue the federal oversight” of various federal programs, Schultz said, “whether it’s education, transportation, Medicaid, public health, public lands.”

“We manage more effectively, more efficiently and more affordably than the federal government, certainly, but more so than any other state in the action,” Schultz said. “Sign us up. Please.”
The House speaker said “the request has been made” to the Trump administration — which has already made moves to shift regulatory power to the states, most recently with his executive order to dismantle the U.S. Education Department. 
“I’ve been so excited to hear the response back from both” Kennedy and Zeldin, Schultz said. 
When asked about Schultz’s comments, Kennedy told reporters the Trump administration welcomed the idea. 
“President Trump’s vision for this country is that the states should be 50 laboratories around the country, that they should be able to run their own affairs and the best ideas … are coming from the bottom up,” Kennedy said. “We are determined to do that, and we’re talking about doing it already, and we’re going to move very quickly.”
Trump administration to Utah: ‘Get us a list’ of what Utah wants
In an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday, Schultz shared more details about his meetings with the top Trump administration officials, as well as what he hopes will come of them.
“Such a huge day for the state of Utah and certainly for me and some of the things I’ve been pushing,” Schultz said. 
He pointed to his speech on the opening day of the 2025 Utah Legislature, when he issued a rallying cry for Utah to wrest control of public lands away from the federal government — something Utah’s GOP is more optimistic about than ever given Trump’s election. 
During that speech, Schultz shared the same words as he did Monday: “We’d like to petition the federal government to allow Utah to stand as a national experiment, allowing us to keep a portion of our federal tax dollars, run the programs, and discontinue federal oversight.”

“To our federal delegation, I have three words: Sign. Us. Up,” Schultz said at the time, claiming as he did this week that the state can better manage education, transportation, Medicaid and public lands
Schultz said the meetings with Kennedy and Zeldin “couldn’t have (gone) better.” 
“I mean, it was just like, ‘Absolutely, that’s one of the directives from Trump, giving states more autonomy to deal with their affairs, pushing states can do it better than the federal government can,” Schultz said. “They talked about Utah and how we’ve led the nation on so many fronts, how we’re better managed. So they are very open to it.”
Schultz said their response was “get us a list of the things you want us to look at and focus on.” So now, the speaker said he plans to work with Gov. Spencer Cox’s administration, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and other state agencies to “see what we can come up with.” 
Adams, in a prepared statement issued Tuesday, focused his comments on paving the way for Utah’s future, especially when it comes to energy production and “independence.” He said “it was great to sit down” with Kennedy and Zeldin to “discuss Utah’s efforts to become an energy hub and how we’re working to build a brighter, healthier future for our children and communities.” 
“Our state and nation need more energy, and Utah is uniquely positioned to lead the charge toward energy independence,” Adams said. “With its abundant resources and innovative spirit, Utah is ready to help ensure a future with reliable, safe and affordable energy. America must become the AI capital of the world because the nation that leads in AI will shape the future — driving economic growth, military power and global peace.”
How would Utah gain more autonomy?
Ideally, Schultz said he’d like Utah’s federal funding to come in the form of “block grants” that would let the state, rather than federal officials, manage the programs. 
“Heck, we’ll do it cheaper,” Schultz said. “Block grant us the money that you’re spending, and, you know, even reduce it 10%, 15%, 20%, or whatever that money is, we’ll have to look at it. But we can do it so much cheaper, so much more efficient and more effective and affordable here in the state of Utah.” 
It’s not yet clear to what extent Utah could take control over federal dollars and programming. Schultz acknowledged there could be limits on what the president or his administration could do without facing lawsuits or other hurdles. 
“There’s some things that Congress has probably given enough authority to the EPA, HHS, and transportation, to make those determinations,” Schultz said. “And then there’s some that probably can’t happen.”
Transportation secretary: Utah, feds must invest in transit to support growth, prepare for Olympics

However, Schultz said that if necessary, Utah state leaders will be ready to convene a special session to take action. 
“It’s a priority for myself, President Adams, and Gov. Cox,” Schultz said. “We will come into a special session and make changes necessary on the state side, set policies, to do this.” 
Schultz pointed to Utah’s Department of Environmental Quality, which answers to the EPA, and said that Utah already has more “autonomy” than other states. 
“Here we run a lot of the programs at the state level with guidance from the EPA, instead of having the EPA run those. And so we’re going to look to expand those,” Schultz said. “What can the states take over? What will the EPA give to the states, specifically to Utah?”
Monday’s meetings could ultimately save Utah taxpayers “hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions,” Schultz said. He claimed that if the federal government turns more control over to Utah and if the federal government cuts down on regulations, especially for transportation and permitting within the EPA, it will result in massive cost savings. 
‘Hands off’ protests
Over the weekend, thousands of Utahns joined the worldwide “Hands Off” protest against Trump and Elon Musk. They protested against Department of Government Efficiency cuts that have targeted services, federal workers’ jobs, and more. 
Schultz acknowledged that in the early months of Trump’s return to the White House, his aggressive actions have resulted in some chaos — but he said “most of that has walked backwards, so the chaos isn’t happening anymore. They’ll be more strategic, they’ll be more thoughtful around some of those things.” 
Schultz also defended Trump embracing Musk and DOGE, arguing the federal government’s spending has been “unsustainable.”
“These are things that needed to happen for decades,” he said, adding that “Trump was very transparent in what he was going to do before he was elected. And people elected Trump on the fact that he was going to put Elon in charge of helping reduce government expenses, go look for corruption, go look for efficiencies. … Those are all good things.” 
Utah, however, has been hit by painful federal layoffs, including the loss of dozens of public health workers in state and local health departments. Though he said those layoffs were of “temporary employees,” Schultz also acknowledged that the timing of the announcement that Trump would be cutting COVID-19 funds short was sudden. 
“Having a little bit of time to work through it would have been much better, and we did talk about that with (Kennedy),” Schultz said. “Having even 30 days or two weeks heads up … would have been much better. But you know, we’ll find a way through it.” 
He also acknowledged that some cuts targeted mental health funding, “and we have a shortage of mental health workers in the state of Utah.” 
Still, while “layoffs are tough and never easy,” Schultz also defended the moves as necessary to tamp down on federal spending. 
“It’s unsustainable,” Schultz said. “So something needs to be done, and it’s something the majority of Americans agree with.”

David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, speaks to a colleague on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 11, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee advanced a bill allowing the state’s dominant agricultural organization to offer its members health benefit plans but not before making several changes to the legislation.
HB 477, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, would allow a nonprofit agricultural organization — fitting the description of the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa) — to provide health plan options not subject to state insurance regulations. 
The bill was the subject of a tense public hearing last week in which farmers’ economic fears were pitted against consumer protection concerns. Faulkner told the House Health Committee Tuesday that he had agreed to changes to move the bill forward.
“I think the bill, as is before you, is in great shape, and I don’t think it needs any amendments,” he said. “But still, to address concerns, like we’ve done, we are going to have some amendments today.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lawmakers introduced eight amendments. A ninth amendment that would have limited who could be denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition was not considered after Faulkner said “it would kill the bill.”
Of the eight amendments, six passed, including one of which Faulkner considered “not friendly.”
That amendment, offered by Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, R-Foley, added a line stating that the Alabama Department of Insurance would enforce the legislation passed. Holk-Jones did not explain the amendment to Faulkner, who claimed he did not understand it, but she said in the public hearing last week that as a career insurance professional, she wanted to be sure that the organization’s plans were explicitly stated in law, instead of an expectation it would be included in the contract.
Faulkner objected to the amendment. 
“This is too vague for me to understand and what that means, and I don’t know that the Department of Insurance would know what that allows them to do or they can do,” Faulkner said.
Another amendment by Holk-Jones, which Faulkner considered “friendly,” requires insurance agents and brokers to be licensed by Alabama, a concern she also shared during last week’s public hearing.
Rep. Bryan Brinyark, R-Windham Springs, offered an amendment that prohibits the nonprofit agricultural organization from increasing premiums if a policyholder utilizes their health benefit plan.
“I hope we’re getting a better product for the members. That’s what I care about. I want to make sure that the people in my district are getting the best plan that they can get under this bill,” Brinyark said.
Faulkner said that he wanted to “just echo [Brinyark’s] comments” and said that had been the intent.
“I just wanted to say because I agree with your comments, and what we’ve said is that once you’re covered on this plan, you’re not going to be canceled or your premium raised based on an individual health condition,” Faulkner said.
Rep. Jeff Sorrells, R-Hartford, offered an amendment that shifted the premium tax from the Department of Revenue to the Department of Insurance. An amendment by Rep. Mark Shirey, R-Mobile, requires the organization providing the health plan to cover some of the out-of-network costs of emergency care.
An amendment by Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, also passed, requiring the health plan to include mental health and substance misuse care, as well as prescription drugs to covered benefits.
“I think I don’t have to go into too much elaborate details on why this is crucial and important for all people in the state,” Rafferty said.
Another amendment from Holk-Jones that would have required the nonprofit agricultural organization to submit an annual report on the number of people it covers failed after Faulkner called it “unnecessary.” Another amendment by Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, would have prohibited the organization from adding or amending annual or lifetime limits without notice, but Faulkner said he could not accept that.
“It doesn’t mean I’m not willing to continue to talk and work on this. We have been working on this even today, and so I would ask for the committee not to pass this at this time, because I do believe it’s dealing with something that is highly unlikely to ever happen,” Faulkner said.
Holk-Jones pushed back, saying that “if you’re not planning on, if it’s highly unlikely, then it shouldn’t be a problem.”
“All I think Rep. Warren is asking for is the highly unlikely possibility that this is done, that the amendment would say that there would be a 60-day notice,” Holk-Jones said.
Faulkner said after the committee meeting that he expects the House to consider the bill on Thursday.

Joe Lombardo and law enforcement officials from Northern Nevada would turn back the clock on modest reforms passed by lawmakers with bipartisan support in 2019. 
“This legislation was drafted to put teeth back into Nevada’s penal code, hold criminals accountable, empower judges and prosecutors and support victims of crime,” Lombardo said at a news conference Tuesday in front of the Carson City sheriff’s office. 
The bill’s introduction comes on the heels of the revelation that the Nevada Department of Corrections has a $53 million budget deficit. 
“I was convinced the Governor’s crime bill being released at the same time NDOC shockingly shared it paid $60m in overtime and predicted worse deficits in the near future was a joke, but it was apparently serious,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said via email. “It’s incumbent on the Governor to share how he plans on paying for his relic-of-the-past crime bill.”

Last session, Lombardo spearheaded the Crime Reduction Act, which increased penalties for drug dealers, and limited early discharge from probation for gun violations.
“It’s evident that more work remains in our fight to secure our communities,” Lombardo said Tuesday. 
Lombardo, on the campaign trail in 2022, blamed increases in crime on Assembly Bill 236, which was passed in 2019. His current legislation comes amid a reduction in a number of crime categories and increases in others. According to data from the State of Nevada, from 2023 to 2024: 

Property crime was down 12.37% 
Domestic violence was down 2.81%
Violent crime was down 6%
Crimes against the elderly were up 31.86%
Hate crimes were up 88% from 2023, but down slightly from 2020

The legislation, Senate Bill 457, would enact multiple measures to toughen penalties and broaden the scope of infraction on the books.
“Historically, partisanship has prevented meaningful progress for public safety, but I am hopeful we can push past this session,” Lombardo said. 
Lombardo’s Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act would increase costs for the Nevada Department of Corrections by $3.6 million in the current biennium, by just under $7.2 million for the next biennium, and by $42.2 million in future bienniums, according to a fiscal note. 
“Much of the long-term increase is due to habitual criminal convictions with delayed effects,” NDOC wrote in the fiscal note. “For lesser sentences, this delay will take on average a year after implementation for an effect to begin.”
NDOC projects the reforms would add 38 offenders a year to the prison population, with an average incarceration of 6.5 years. 
“For greater sentences, effects are expected to take up to 20 years to begin to materialize due to sizable average existing sentence lengths, even when the habitual criminal sentence is excluded,” according to NDOC. The department estimates 111 additional offenders would return in the first fiscal year after their release, increasing to 215 the next year. 
“This increase is expected to continue until a plateau is reached at 632 additional offenders. The average total daily cost per offender in FY 2025 is $91.43,” NDOC notes. 
Last week, NDOC director James Dzurenda testified the department is racking up $60 million in overtime a year because of the need to shift correction officers from one post to another to address staffing shortages, resulting in a $50 million dollar budgeting shortfall that took lawmakers by surprise. 
“It’s the utmost importance to me to ensure that the law enforcement community has the tools in order to change the crime picture in our communities, and we will figure out a way through the government processes and all the available funding resources available to us to address those particular issues,” Lombardo said Tuesday, adding he is “evaluating time served for non-violent offenses” and projects a savings of $37 million a year as a result. 
“Additionally, we will work through the existing bills that are going through the state process, and we can balance the budget to address this,” he said. “In my level of importance and triage we deal with in state government, nothing is as important…”  
Haseebullah says Nevada’s district attorneys’ offices should disclose how much it will cost to prosecute the additional cases envisioned by Lombardo’s legislation.
The D.A.s, he says “have opposed record sealing bills for bullshit arrests that were dismissed with their opposition based on cost considerations, but magically, something like this is free for them.”
Lombardo’s legislation:

Enacts tougher penalties for theft, burglary and for repeat offenders;
Provides an additional penalty for offenders who commit new crimes while released from incarceration but are still under sentence; 
Allows separate charges for each sexual image of a person under the age of 16;
Lowers the threshold for felony theft charges from $1200 to $750;. 
Imposes mandatory minimum sentences and increased penalties for trafficking large quantities of fentanyl;
Eliminates diversion programs for offenders who victimize children, the elderly, and vulnerable adults;
Imposes a sentencing enhancement for felonies committed by offenders on pre-trial release; 
Revises stalking crimes to include dating relationships, social media and other electronic means; 
Lowers the threshold of the number of felonies required for conviction as a habitual criminal; 
Expands marijuana and marijuana metabolite thresholds for intoxication; 
Increases penalties for DUI offenses resulting in death;
Domestic batterers would be required to surrender their firearms; 
Increases burglary punishments, which were reduced in 2019;
Extends the time for a bail hearing, set in 2021 at 24 hours, to 72 hours;
Requires that any payments collected from a criminal defendant be first applied to pay restitution to the victim;
Requires that any money collected from a defendant be used to satisfy restitution before it can be applied to court fines and fees;
Ensures that a felony DUI offender who is in a diversion program will be subject to another felony for driving impaired;
Increases the penalty range for DUI causing death to  one to 20 years to five to 25 years; 
And allows DUI offenders to be charged in certain cases with second degree murder.

“Nevada has no money left to experiment on antiquated tough-on-crime policies which continue to devastate our budget and don’t make our community safer,” Haseebullah observed. “We’re about to face cuts statewide on basic services. I have no idea how anyone with any common sense would view this type of exorbitantly expensive regressive idea as a plus, but these types of performative messages seem to be the Nevada way.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Tuesday approved a bill that would impose new regulations on consumable hemp products amid concerns over youth access and a lack of oversight of the products.
HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, would give the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board authority to license and regulate the manufacturing, distribution and retail sale of hemp-derived consumables and banning their sale to anyone under 21.
Whitt said that there were “recent developments” that made the bill more urgent and read a press release from Herbal Oasis, a company that produces hemp-derived products that planned to expand to Alabama, saying “their product will be in convenience stores, grocery stores and other locations throughout Alabama and Florida Panhandle, starting in late March.”
“This is exactly what we discussed last week that we were trying to do, was stop this product being served in such a manner,” Whitt said.

In a public hearing Wednesday, opponents of the bill said that there was a lack of data for what Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence, referred to as a lawmakers’ “hysteria,” and that data from the Alabama Poison Information Center suggests it is currently affecting less than .1% of children in Alabama. Opponents also suggested a study commission to develop “evidence-based policy” on cannabis regulation.
Under the proposed law, consumable hemp products could only be sold in regulated, 21-and-over retail environments — either standalone hemp product stores or existing off-premise liquor stores approved by local authorities.
The bill sets a five-milligram THC limit per serving and prohibits marketing or packaging that appeals to minors. It also bans vending machines and self-serve displays for such products.
“We do have some bad activities that are our problems,” Whitt said, referencing children’s snacks being used to market these products, but he did not reference evidence supporting the claim. “You’ll not see the Doritos, the Airheads and things like that that are strictly marketed for our kids.”
The bill also creates civil and criminal penalties, such as fines starting at $1,000 for exceeding allowed THC percentages or a Class C misdemeanor, with punishments of up to 30 days in jail and up to a $500 fine, for failing to keep records like invoices for inspection, an excise tax, and a dedicated compliance fund. It would repeal an existing law that currently allows the sale of psychoactive cannabinoids to adults.
Rep. Jeremy Gray, D-Opelika, said he did not oppose the bill but wanted to study the matter further. 
“What I would encourage is that we look at… an economic impact study and maybe a task force… so that way we actually know the facts.”
The bill passed by voice vote and now moves to the full House for consideration.

Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman from Washoe County believes Nevada should replicate a state-managed private insurance program already in place in 34 states [&#8230;]","Flames engulf the vegetation surrounding residential neighborhoods as the Pinehaven Fire burns on November 17, 2020 in Reno, Nevada. (Photo by Trevor Bexon/Getty Images)Thousands of homeowners in Nevada have seen their insurance policies canceled or not-renewed due to wildfire risk, prompting state lawmakers to warn that “a crisis is brewing” and considering ways to combat it.
Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman from Washoe County believes Nevada should replicate a state-managed private insurance program already in place in 34 states and the District of Columbia.
Dickman is sponsoring Assembly Bill 437, which would establish a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan – an insurance program of last resort for homeowners who cannot reasonably obtain coverage through standard insurance providers. Her bill is one of two bills making its way through the Nevada State Legislature focused on home insurance availability amid increasing wildfire risk.
FAIR plans, which have been around since the 1960s, provide coverage for homeowners who cannot find policies on the private market. The plans are managed by the state governments, but they are backed financially by a pool of the private insurers.
California’s FAIR plan has received the most public attention and criticism because of its size and the prevalence of wildfires in the state, but Dickman told the committee that Nevada’s FAIR program would not look like its western neighbor’s.
Dickman wants Nevada’s FAIR plan to remain “a true market of last resort” that does not compete with the private market. To ensure that, she has drafted a conceptual amendment specifying that homeowners be denied by three standard insurance companies before being eligible for Nevada FAIR. They must also attempt to secure non-FAIR coverage every two years.
Homeowners would also be required to undergo a wildfire risk assessment and implement its recommendations.
The Nevada Fire Chiefs Association worked with Dickman on AB437. Representatives from the group emphasized the need to mitigate fire risk.
Elko County Fire Chief Matthew Petersen estimated that once a week he receives a phone call from someone asking for help because their home insurance policy is getting canceled.

Dickman has also capped what FAIR will insure – $5 million for commercial properties and $750,000 for residential properties.
She acknowledged those limits are relatively low considering the cost of housing in many parts of the state. The median price of a home in Washoe County is currently around $550,000.
“We have to start somewhere,” said Dickman. “We’ve been talking about this, and talking about this, and talking about it, and there’s never any action taken. We’re looking for the perfect plan.”
Nevada, she argued, cannot afford to delay taking legislative action knowing it will also take time to implement any program. She noted Colorado passed legislation to create a FAIR plan in 2023 and is only beginning to offer coverage this year. 
“If we put it off for two years, it’ll be another two years, and by then we’ll be in a crisis,” Dickman added. 
In 2023, 481 homeowners insurance policies were canceled or non-renewed due to wildfire risk — an 82% increase compared to the previous year, according to the Nevada Division of Insurance. That same year, nearly 5,000 applications for homeowners insurance were declined due to wildfire risk — a 104.8% increase over the previous year.
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist for Washoe County, said there is a misguided assumption that wildfire insurance is “an issue of the 1%” involving multimillion homes in Incline Village.
“That’s not true,” she said. “We’ve heard heartbreaking stories from senior citizens who’ve lived in homes for 50 years and are at risk of losing their homes because they couldn’t get property insurance.”
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association and the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies oppose the FAIR plan proposal.
APCIA in a letter of opposition wrote that a FAIR plan “fails to address the underlying issues that result in less affordable or available coverage.”
Instead, the industry is supporting a separate bill meant to give them more flexibility in the types of insurance plans they can offer Nevadans.
Regulatory sandbox
Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill is sponsoring Assembly Bill 376, which would create for insurance companies what’s known as a “regulatory sandbox” that allows them to test out new types of plans that don’t fit under current state regulations. The sandbox program would exist for 4 years, after which the Nevada Division of Insurance would have to submit to the Legislature a report with information and recommendations.
Nevada Insurance Commissioner Scott Kipper, who presented the bill with O’Neill, told the committee the idea is to incentivize companies to create “innovative products” by giving them “some flexibility to generate revenue that is needed to manage risk.”
O’Neill, who represents Carson City and parts of Storey and Washoe counties, said his bill uses model language drafted by the National Council of Insurance Legislators.
AB376 doesn’t mandate any type of product be tested but does provide some potential options, including removing wildfire coverage from the standard homeowners policies and offering it as a standalone package.
The bill received a mixed reaction from committee members. Democratic Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui said she is supportive of regulatory sandboxes to spur innovation. She pointed out that the Legislature passed one for the fintech industry in 2023.
Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter expressed concern that insurance companies might be attempting to free themselves of having to cover wildfire damage. “Are we turning everyone loose and letting the fires burn down our houses?”
That concern was echoed by the Consumer Federation of America, which opposes the bill.
“This is a shoot first, ask questions later approach that is certain to increase premiums and put consumer financial security at risk,” the organization wrote in a letter of opposition.
The Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee has taken no action on either bill.
Dickman’s FAIR plan bill must clear the committee by Friday or it will be considered dead.
O’Neill’s regulatory sandbox bill is exempt from legislative deadlines, meaning it has more time to advance. Kipper told the committee he is working on ways to get the bill’s fiscal note ($237,000 over the upcoming biennium) removed.
O’Neill and Dickman’s bills are not mutually exclusive, and the latter assemblymember is listed as one of several sponsors on the former’s bill.
Washoe County testified in support of both bills.
Risk in Nevada
Nearly one-fifth of Nevada’s land area has been burned by wildfire in the past 40 years, landing the state fifth in the nation for land area burned by wildfires.
A new study by the Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas found that more than 18% of Nevada’s land mass has been torched by wildfire from 1984 through 2024.
Northern Nevada has experienced a significantly larger number and total acres burned by wildfires than Southern Nevada, due to the differences in climate, terrain, and the presence of forested land. 
Rural counties in Northern Nevada were the most affected by wildfires in the state. Elko County had the largest percentage of land area burned by wildfire at 41%, followed by Humboldt at 39%, according to the study. 
One fourth of Washoe County’s land area has been burdened by wildfires. Carson City, the state’s capital, also experienced noticeable burns with 15% of its land impacted by wildfire.
In Lincoln County, a rural county in Southern Nevada, about 18% of land mass has been burned by wildfires since 1984.
In Clark County, Nevada’s most populous county, only about 5% of its total land burned by wild fires in the past 40 years.
The Lied Center’s study was based on Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity wildfire data, a joint program administered by the United States Geological Survey and the United States Forest Service to map wildfires across the country.
Lied Center for Real Estate Research Director Nicholas Irwin, who co-authored the study, told the Current that as more people move into forested areas wildfires are likely to become much more economically destructive moving forward.
“Coupled with the climate change we’re seeing, longer drought, increased temperatures— that’s going to make wildfire seasons a lot a lot worse,” he said.
While other states have experienced more economically destructive wildfires, the number of wildfires impacting infrastructure in Nevada has increased in recent years. 
In September, the Davis Fire broke out in Davis Creek Regional Park, about 20 miles south of Reno. The wind-driven fire rapidly burned through 5,824 acres of private, state, and federal lands, driving the evacuation of about 20,000 people from residential neighborhoods and businesses. The fire ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 residences.
Nevada’s fire season, once limited to late summer and early fall, now spans nearly the entire calendar year.
High wildfire risk makes areas less attractive for developers,  impacting housing development, said Irwin. Rural areas, which already deal with high construction cost and other barriers to development, could be disproportionately impacted
As Dickman put it during the AB437 hearing: “You can’t sell a home you can’t insure.”
These concerns are contributing to this year’s push for  legislative action.
Beyond the proposals currently being considered, Irwin said Nevada could take a more proactive role in monitoring wildfire risk as other states do. In Colorado, the Colorado State Forest Service maps wildfires in an effort to inform homeowners and business owners of the impending risk for their location based on fire conditions.
“It’s very costly, but it is very informative, and there’s research out there to suggest homeowners respond to that information,” Irwin said. “Knowing the relative risk of that land is going to be really important so we can think about how to build strong and resilient homes that won’t be at risk for future wildfires.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1229661053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

(Getty Images)Data on households in Nevada facing power or gas shut offs due to nonpayment amid scorching summers and frigid winters is largely unknown.
That could change under a bill that would require utilities to report on a quarterly basis the number of disconnections due to non-payment broken down by month and zip code. Senate Bill 442, sponsored by the Senate Committee on Growth and Infrastructure, was presented to lawmakers by state Democratic Sen. Melanie Scheible on Monday.
Nevada does not require utilities to publicly disclose the number of customers they disconnect, leaving little transparency to understand the full extent of disconnections. Nationally, 26 states and Washington D.C. require some level of public reporting on utility disconnections due to nonpayment.
Limited data collected by  utility regulators shows a growing trend in the number of residents in the state who have had their power cut due to nonpayment. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. 
“The information that we do have highlights the need for better reporting,” said Olivia Tanager, the director of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter which covers Nevada and the Eastern Sierra. The Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter recommended the bill and helped present the bill to lawmakers on Monday.
Supporters of the bill say mandatory disconnection reporting by month and zip code would provide health departments, community-based organizations, and public services in Nevada with the data they need to identify the communities most at risk of disconnection. That data could then be used to focus public assistance on where, and when, it’s most needed.
“We continue to see rising utility costs associated with more extreme weather and an increasing number of households facing financial difficulties. It is vital that we have the data we need to understand the full scope of this issue and take informed, meaningful action,” Tanager continued. 
According to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1 in 4 American households experience some form of energy insecurity – an inability to afford household energy needs – each year, with little improvement over the past decade.
“These disconnections can have severe consequences, not only leaving individuals and families without essential services like electricity and heating, but also contributing to broader economic and social instability,” Tanager said during the Monday hearing on the bill.
During the hearing, both NV Energy and Southwest Gas testified as neutral on the bill, noting their existing energy assistance programs as well as the potential benefits of the bill in directing outside resources.
The legislation’s advocates say the Trump administration’s ongoing policies to pause and/or cancel disbursement of federal funds cast doubt on the stability of federal energy affordability programs. 
Federal employees for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — which provides funding to help low-income households pay for energy costs — were fired last week as part of a dramatic restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, making the future of the program unclear.
In 2024 Nevada received $17 million in LIHEAP funding to help about 12,000 low-income households keep their lights on. 
“All of those folks that administer that program were unfortunately fired, and so there is some question about the longevity of LIHEAP and how that’s going to impact folks,” Tanager said.
Several advocacy groups testified in support for the bill Monday including, the Northern Nevada Central Labor Council, United Way of Southern Nevada, the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and the Moms for Clean Air. 
Congress has expressed an interest in determining the scale and scope of electricity disconnections in recent years. In 2022, Congress directed the U.S. Energy Information Administration to begin collecting monthly data on utility disconnections, but the lack of public data has made comprehensive national data difficult to obtain, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Limited data does show that Black and Hispanic households are statistically more likely to have their power disconnected, according to a 2023 report on electric utility disconnections by the Congressional Research Service.
“The intent of the bill is to make sure that we have regular information so that we can drive services that exist to help folks keep their lights on where they’re most needed, when they’re most needed,” Tanager said.

However, both the Swartz campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee see a path to victory, with the DCCC listing Michigan’s 4th Congressional district as one of its targets for 2026. Additionally, EMILY’s List, a political action committee that backs women candidates who support abortion rights, has also identified Huizenga’s seat as one they hope to flip next year.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A camel, it has been said, is a horse designed by a committee.
A committee of state GOP leaders recently designed a “historic” income tax-cut plan.
But what they delivered was a camel: lopsided, ungainly, and reeking of a bad attitude.
Worse, they put the cart before the camel, announcing the tax-cut plan with much ballyhoo and bunkum before realizing that it doesn’t cut taxes for most South Carolinians.
It actually raises taxes in 2026 for 60% of South Carolinians (or nearly 1.7 million tax filers), as per estimates released by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office a week after the big announcement.
The bill includes huge tax cuts for some, but those cuts overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.
Roughly 9,900 tax filers with more than $1 million in income would see their taxes cut by an average of $31,000, according to reporting by S.C. Daily Gazette Editor Seanna Adcox.
Many others would get little or nothing.
The bill was supposed to be fast-tracked for approval, but now House leaders have postponed debate while they explore other options.
No, I’m not making this up.
This was a hugely embarrassing episode of DOGE-level ineptitude by the people who are supposed to be leading our state.
Redesigned camel
At least the bill was shelved for the moment. But Rep. Brandon Newton, chairman of Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, said Republicans remain “committed to passing income tax reform this year.”
That means another tax-cut camel may soon be galumphing along the dusty road to the Statehouse.
Whatever rough beast emerges out of ongoing discussions, the General Assembly should reject it.
State lawmakers should not cut taxes.
The postponed bill slashed taxes by more than $200 million, with a provision to cut $200 million in taxes every year when revenue projections rise by 5%. A revised bill might cut taxes by that amount as well.
We simply can’t afford that. Our state has too many critical needs that should be addressed right now, including infrastructure, education, health care, crime and public safety.
We should remember that the General Assembly just cut taxes over the past few years by a whopping $1 billion, on top of sending $1 billion back as rebates in 2022, limiting the ability of lawmakers to deal effectively with the state’s top needs, such as fixing our notoriously awful roads.
A bold new plan called Momentum 2025 offers great hope for upgrading our roads, but it carries a price tag of $1 billion a year. There’s no plan, however, to fund Momentum 2025, as Adcox pointed out in an excellent commentary tracing the history of our road woes.
The state faces other critical concerns, such as the teacher shortage that results in potentially thousands of South Carolina students beginning each school year without a fully qualified teacher in the classroom.
Health care challenges
We’ve got dire healthcare challenges in South Carolina as well. An estimated 521,660 South Carolinians under age 65 lack health insurance, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
We should follow the lead of 40 other states in expanding Medicaid, drawing down billions in federal funds and investing some state money to provide health care coverage for an additional 360,000 low-income South Carolinians.
In addition, with Medicaid threatened by cuts on the federal level, state lawmakers may need to step in to protect South Carolina’s most vulnerable citizens.
South Carolina also needs to invest more in children, especially in the areas of prenatal care and childcare.
South Carolina ranks near the bottom of the nation for child care affordability. Overall, our state ranks among the worst in the nation for the well-being of children, according to the annual Kids Count.
The S.C. Department of Juvenile Justice, meanwhile, has been plagued by overcrowding and other unsafe conditions.
South Carolina desperately needs to invest more in law enforcement as well. Our state has one of the highest murder rates in the nation and one of the highest rates of fatalities on the road, which includes one of the highest rates of drunken driving deaths.
One study called South Carolina “the most dangerous state for drunk driving in America.”
A tax cut doesn’t solve those problems.
And state lawmakers have made big new promises to South Carolinians this year, including plans to spend $60 million that we can’t afford on school vouchers. You can bet Republicans will want to spend a lot more on that in the future as well.
Lawmakers who support a big tax cut argue that it’s needed to keep South Carolina growing, but that’s not a problem. We’re already one of the fastest-growing states in the nation.
Finally, it would be irresponsible to cut state taxes with the U.S. economy in a tailspin as the stock market and consumer confidence plummet.
With Washington in chaos, we need sober heads in Columbia to address our state’s most pressing needs, and that doesn’t include a big annual tax cut.
State leaders have to be the adults in the room.

Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy | Arizona MirrorThe leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.

The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Donor interest in New Jersey’s gubernatorial election catapulted upward along with the number of candidates, state election law officials said Tuesday.
Aurea Vazquez-Alexander, compliance director for the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, said during a commission meeting that the number of contributions to gubernatorial candidates participating in the state’s public financing program increased by 374% compared to 2021, the last time New Jersey held a governor’s race.
“There has been a significant increase in contribution volume and review complexity from 2021 versus 2025,” she said.
One of the commission’s tasks is to review donations to gubernatorial candidates to make sure they comply with public financing rules. The spike in donations means the eight candidates receiving public financing this year have submitted more than 38,000 contributions for the commission’s review, up from just over 7,900 four years ago.
Vazquez-Alexander added that the steep rise in contributions was not solely the result of a larger candidate pool.
“In 2021, the highest contribution count for any single candidate was 5,968 contributions. In 2025, a single candidate received over 13,000 contributions — more than the entire 2021 total,” she said without naming the candidate.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, cannot seek reelection in the fall. Among the six Democrats vying in the June 10 primary to succeed him, Rep. Mikie Sherrill has received the most in matching funds, $5.1 million through April 3. In the five-man Republican primary, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is the first candidate to max out his $5.5 million in primary matching funds.
Candidates are due to disclose their fundraising for the first quarter of 2025 by April 15. 
Five Democrats — Sherrill, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney — have qualified for matching funds. Three Republicans — Ciattarelli, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and former radio host Bill Spadea — are receiving matching public dollars.
In all, 11 gubernatorial candidates will be on the June 10 primary ballot. Sean Spiller, a Democrat and president of statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association, and Republicans Justin Barbera and Mario Kranjac did not qualify for matching funds by the March 24 deadline. Candidates must raise and spend $580,000 to be eligible for matching funds from the state.
The number of candidates running for governor this year is far from record-setting, said Joe Donohue, the commission’s deputy director. Donohue noted 22 candidates ran for the governorship in 1981, the first year New Jersey candidates for governor could receive matching funds. Sixteen candidates received public financing that year.
Still, it’s been 35 years since eight candidates received public financing, he said.
“In terms of the year with a lot of candidates, it’s in the top five, definitely” Donohue said of 2025.
The public financing program offers candidates who meet fundraising and spending thresholds a 2-to-1 match in exchange for an agreement to observe spending and fundraising caps set by the commission.
This year, they must agree to spend no more than $8.7 million on the primary, or $18.5 million in the general election. As of April 3, the program has dispensed more than $29.6 million.

The House and Senate are both looking at putting new limits on the reimbursement rates that health insurance plans for state workers and public school employees pay. Both chambers’ budget proposals also depend on taxes that could apply to hospitals with larger amounts of revenue.
“There’s going to be less money for patient care,” said Chelene Whiteaker, senior vice president of government affairs at the Washington State Hospital Association. 
On the other side of the debate are advocates who contend that hospitals are not paying their fair share in taxes and that care should be more affordable.
“Patients are always the ones who are asked to tighten our belts or skip needed lifesaving care to protect mega hospitals’ bottom lines,” said Sam Hatzenbeler, senior policy associate at the Economic Opportunity Institute. “There is an inherent imbalance that needs to be addressed.” 
“Everybody’s being asked to tighten their belts, but the health care industry is not asked ever to tighten theirs,” she added. 
But industry officials say hospitals are still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and grappling with rising expenses that often outweigh revenue.
According to the hospital association, Washington hospitals lost $1.74 billion in 2023. While the number is high, it was an improvement from the $2.1 billion hospitals lost in 2022. 
In 2023, state lawmakers moved to strengthen hospitals’ finances by approving a plan to secure more federal Medicaid dollars. 
House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, noted that hospitals are one of the largest recipients of state tax dollars through Medicaid, public employee insurance payments and Cascade Care, which is a public health care coverage option available in Washington.
“It’s a tough spot to be in, no question, but the reality is our budget is very squeezed right now and we’re going to have to ask hospitals as well as other beneficiaries of state payments to tighten their belts,” he added.
Hospitals are also facing uncertainty at the federal level as Republicans in Congress contemplate cuts to Medicaid. 
Eric Lewis, the hospital association’s chief financial officer, said Medicaid cuts combined with the proposed state policies “could send hospitals back into financial distress.”
Both chambers had proposed bills — Senate Bill 5083 and House Bill 1123 — to limit health insurance reimbursements for hospitals under health plans for state and school employees. Senate Bill 5083 is still in play. It passed the Senate in March with only Democratic support and now awaits a floor vote in the House.
Supporters say that in addition to lowering state spending, the bill will also reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients.
But by capping the amount a health plan pays for services, the hospital association estimates $170 million in revenue would be lost. 
Oregon has adopted a comparable policy, while states like Colorado, Nevada and Connecticut are looking to pass similar legislation. Hatzenbeler said that in Oregon, the state saved $100 million in the first two years and that out-of-pocket costs fell by 9.5% for patients.
Meanwhile, the House is looking to increase the state’s business and occupation tax, which would affect businesses making over a certain amount of revenue. Some large hospitals would pay the higher tax. Around 20% of hospitals — along with some other entities affiliated with them, like doctors’ offices and long-term care facilities — would pay around $110 million to $130 million more in taxes annually under the House plan, the hospital association estimates. 
The Senate is also contemplating a new payroll tax on large employers, which the hospital association says would raise hospitals’ tax bills by about $160 million a year. 
Hospitals say if these proposals passed, they would be under pressure to negotiate with private insurers to offset the financial hit. If those negotiations aren’t successful, then hospitals would be left looking at options like service cuts or layoffs, or allowing wait times to rise for patients.
“We do understand that the Legislature is dealing with a budget deficit, but this level of damage that these proposals are doing is intense,” Whiteaker said. 
Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, the largest union for public school educators in the state, said that with many people already struggling to afford health care, hospitals should lower executive pay before asking patients to shoulder more of the burden.
“Corporate executives cry wolf every time they’re asked to do their part,” Delaney said. “[Senate Bill 5083] gives many Washington workers hope for more affordable care.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hospital-room--1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

Some of Florida’s private colleges and universities are raising concerns about the House’s proposed budget, which would restrict the state’s Effective Access to Student Education award, also known as EASE, which provides $3,500 to Florida students attending private institutions.
The House budget proposal, which at $113 billion is $4.4 billion less than the Senate’s, calls for schools to meet benchmarks related to graduation and affordability set by the state to be eligible to receive EASE money. The Senate budget does not propose metric requirements. 
Bob Boyd, president of Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida, called the metrics “arbitrary.”
The University of Miami, University of Tampa, and Bethune-Cookman University are among the 15 schools that would be ineligible to receive EASE money if the language is included in the final budget. ICUF estimates about 22,000 students would lose EASE funding.
The EASE grant, established in 1979, is similar to the recently expanded K-12 voucher program in that taxpayer money is used to pay for private school tuition. The House budget would provide $135.9 billion for the program in the coming fiscal year, in line with current year funding of $134.8 billion.
Mike Allen, president of Barry University in Miami Shores, said the proposal “doesn’t track” with the Legislature’s “priorities around school choice that have been made very, very clear.”
Republican Rep. Demi Busatta, chair of the House Higher Education Budget subcommittee, said she is “always open to having a discussion” when asked whether she was open to a glide path to implement the metrics. 
“I think the most important thing is that the money per student is the same. It has not decreased. We have not changed it,” Busatta said, adding that change would not affect students’ eligibility for Bright Futures scholarships. 
She said she has had “many meetings” with ICUF and its institutions including UM, and other stakeholders.
“There’s institutions out there that have a 14- or 15% graduation rate. We want to make sure that students aren’t going, getting into debt when they are not having the best opportunity to be set up for success at that institution.”
ICUF data show some of its member institutions have four-year graduation rates as low as Busatta suggested, including Webber International University, Barry University, and Bethune-Cookman University.

Republican Rep. Mike Caruso, vice chair of the subcommittee, told the Phoenix he is against the private institution restrictions in the House budget proposal as well as the $5 billion cut to the overall budget.
“I think it’s a trickle down from the proposed budget cut of $5 billion from leadership that’s working its way down through the different silos and things are going to suffer as a result,” Caruso said Tuesday.
Caruso said the “big hand of the state puts their foot down on just about everything.”
“These private universities serve a purpose, a tremendous role in the way that we have education, and the EASE program helps to facilitate it. I don’t like these restrictions, we put our hand into everything and we continue to do that,” Caruso said.
‘Ripple effect’
According to ICUF, its institutions produce 28% of nursing degrees and 25% of teaching degrees in the state. 
“The ripple effect can occur in many directions and in many ways, but certainly one will be that this will really limit our ability, particularly here in South Florida, to provide basic services that people need to live here, and I think that would really affect folks,” Allen said, adding that several of the private schools train nurses, a field the state has focused on bolstering amid a shortage. 
Hospitals are “in a panic about the inability to find enough nurses to staff their hospitals,” Allen said. 
“When it comes to the EASE grants, they are essential for thousands of our Florida students,” Caruso said, adding that the language “may be cracking down on the universities, but what we’re really hurting is the students themselves, and those students are the future nurses, the future technicians, the future of our state.”
The House proposal would require schools to have graduation rates of at least 54%, retention rates of at least 67%, and affordability rates of $6,183, among other measurements. 
Private institution presidents told reporters Monday that factors unique to each university could unfairly exempt students, including how the state calculates accessibility and how it considers graduation rates and course drops when students transfer.
Rep. Gallop Franklin, Democratic ranking member on the House Higher Education Budget subcommittee, told the Phoenix implementing changes to EASE should be more “methodical.” 
Franklin said the proposal would affect 22,000 students instantly and result in immediate costs spikes on  students. Franklin suggested grandfathering people in and having conversations with institutions to minimize disruption, or to offer less than $3,500 for the coming year if there are budgetary concerns. 
Franklin said he is not sure that the government should “be in the space of saying, ‘Hey, we’re only going to allow you to take your voucher to certain schools.’”
Budget tightening
Tightening EASE disbursements is part of House Speaker Daniel Perez’s budget, which is lower than the current year’s budget, and comes amid talk of cutting the sales tax by 0.75%. 
Boyd complained the state is using “arbitrary metrics with arbitrary percentages to implement a budget cut — that’s the way I look at it.”
David Armstrong, president of St. Thomas University in Miami Gardens, said supporting private schools helps keep students in Florida. 
“The fact that the Florida state schools are ranked Number One in the country is fantastic for all of us as the citizens of the state, but who has picked up the role as the access schools?” Armstrong said. “In our state, it’s the community college system and the smaller private institutions that are enrollment-driven. Now that works out fine, because that’s a part of our mission, serving those who are underserved.” 
Lawmakers will debate the budget Wednesday before heading into negotiations with the Senate.
“I think most of our institutions will survive. It’s the impact on the students. Because this is a voucher program. This is not a grant to the institution. This is a direct dollar, per dollar, to that student to go to school and use for their education,” said Art Keiser, chancellor of Keiser University in Fort Lauderdale.

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people [&#8230;]","A woman sits with her daughters at a clinic operated by a community health center in New Orleans.

Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Bill Hardwick of Dixon to his right, watch how members are voting Monday on a bill authorizing video lottery terminals. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)A bill allowing the Missouri Lottery to install video gambling machines at retail locations across the state faces a difficult path to final passage — even if the sponsor can find enough votes to get it out of the Missouri House.
Republican state Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also filed a bill allowing video lottery games, said in an interview Tuesday that he hasn’t pushed his proposal forward because it was assigned to a hostile committee.
Three Senate bills authorizing video lottery games were assigned to the Senate Appropriations Committee. None have received a hearing.
“When it comes to putting a committee in a situation where I don’t feel like I have the votes, I’m not going to be pushing for a hearing on something like that,” Hudson said.
That leaves the House bill, given first round approval Monday by a 74-70 vote, as the only legislation in a position to pass by the end of the session. There were two members who voted present and 16 who were absent, during the vote on the bill sponsored by state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon. 
That is eight votes shy of the 82 needed for the House to pass it to the Senate.
Lobbyists favoring the bill said privately that there are 10 members who were absent on the Monday vote who will support it on the next vote. Lobbyists opposing the bill said privately that there are at least 10 members who voted for the bill on first approval who will vote against it on the next vote.
“If they do get to their 82, then we’ll be having some conversations in the Senate about that particular bill,” Hudson said.
But winning passage with only five weeks left before mandatory adjournment — and with the state budget unfinished — “would be a heavy lift,” he said.
The bill awaiting another House vote would:

Allow video lottery games in licensed retail locations. There is no limit on the type of locations except they are prohibited in recreation centers marketed for children. There is no limit on the total number of games statewide;
Require the games to be in a location “distinct and divided from the primary business operation area”;
Declare unlicensed games, called “gray market” games, to be illegal slot machines;
Require affirmative votes in cities and counties to allow the games and create a process for additional votes to prohibit the games afterwards;
Double the boarding fee at casinos to $4 and direct the extra funds to the Missouri Veterans Commission.

The machines will be required to pay out at least 80% of the money wagered in prizes. The remainder will be split three ways — the lottery will receive 34% of the net to support state education programs, with retailers and operators splitting the other 66%.
The fiscal note for the bill estimates that within three years, there will be $1.1 billion for the three-way split — from about $5 billion wagered — generating approximately $350 million in state revenue. 
The gray market games that resemble casino slot machines operate in almost every county of the state. They have proliferated despite efforts by the Missouri State Highway Patrol to initiate prosecutions under anti-gambling laws. After years of operation, convenience store owners, fraternal lodges and other establishments have become dependent on the revenue.
The best-known of the gray market game operators is Torch Electronics of Wildwood, which has a strong lobbying presence in the Capitol to oppose any effort to restrict its business and is a prolific political giver.
When Hardwick brought the bill to the floor, he had prepared an amendment that would strip provisions requiring retailers to give up gray market machines if they became video lottery retailers. The provision also would have required the removal of all gray market machines within six months of the launch of video lottery.
But during debate, an amendment directly declaring any unlicensed machines to be illegal slot machines was added.
“I call this, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and in this case, smells like a duck, it’s a duck,” said state Rep. Jim Murphy, a St. Louis Republican who offered the amendment. “We need to regulate these gray machines.”
Hardwick had only one significant question about the amendment as he sought votes.
“I’m going to ask everyone the same question: If your amendment gets on, will you support the bill?” he said.
“Yes,” Murphy replied.
“Nothing further, Mr. Speaker,” Hardwick said.
In recent years, Senate debate on gambling has been split among casino supporters, who wanted sports wagering, video lottery supporters and those who were happy with no action, leaving the gray market machines in place.
Hudson said his top goal for legislation on video lottery is to eliminate the gray market machines.
“I’ve gotten reports of kids playing these machines,” Hudson said. “We can’t have this. We need to do something about it. I don’t think this issue is going to just go away.”
During House debate, defenders of the gray market machines said allowing them to operate was a question of liberty. State Rep. Bryan Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, called the licensing and rules in the bill “a complex and ridiculous system that grows government” and questioned whether the gray market machines are as menacing as some see them.
“These things have been in this gray area for the last five or six years, and to my knowledge, Missouri is still operating,” Wolfin said.
Hardwick defended the bill as a compromise that allows the revenue flow to continue while assuring the public that the machines offer a fair chance of winning.
“At this point, almost everybody in the building is dissatisfied with our product to some degree, and that’s because I did not create a product that was trying to advantage one business over the other,” Hardwick said.
The final vote split both parties. There were 28 Democrats who voted for it along with 46 Republicans. There were 16 Democrats opposed, joining 54 Republicans.
If the final eight votes can be found to move the bill to the Senate, Hudson said, he will be looking at the bill to determine whether it adequately suppresses gray market machines without a net expansion of gambling.
“My goal is to restrict, regulate and (to) protect kids,” Hudson said. “I am opposed to gambling expansion. I am not going to be getting behind legislation that I feel like is an expansion of gambling.”

The drought declaration, which began in 2023, covers the Upper Yakima, Lower Yakima and Naches watersheds. Kittitas and Yakima counties and part of Benton County are part of the drought emergency.
Seven other counties are in a drought advisory status, including Okanogan and Chelan counties and Pierce, King, Snohomish, Skagit and Whatcom on the west side of the state, according to the Washington Department of Ecology.
Although snowpack has improved in the Yakima Valley, there won’t be enough spring runoff to replenish reservoirs and soil after two back-to-back years of drought, state officials said.
During a news conference in Seattle on Tuesday, Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said six of the last 10 years have seen a drought declaration for some part of the state.
“This is the new normal: More rain, less snowpack, earlier springs, hotter, drier summers, and increasing odds that snow droughts will happen 4 out every 10 years,” he said. “This isn’t a future threat; it’s happening right now.”
Sixkiller said the state wants to shift from treating drought as an emergency response “to something we plan for and build around.”
 Conditions in Yakima Valley

Droughts involve multiple factors, said Karin Bumbaco, deputy state climatologist. It’s not just about lack of rain, but also the timing of the rain, snowpack levels and the timing of snowmelt.
“There are many ways to make a drought,” she said.
This year, a lack of precipitation in the central and northern Cascades resulted in below-normal snowpack. The Upper Yakima Basin is at 75% median snowpack, and even though the Lower Yakima and Naches watersheds are at near-normal snowpack, it hasn’t been enough to make up for deficits the past two years, she said.
The Upper Yakima Basin has a long-term precipitation deficit of 33 inches, she said. The five reservoirs that feed the Yakima River — Keechelus, Kachess, Cle Elum, Bumping and Rimrock — are at 59% of normal, the fifth-lowest levels since 1971.
Climate change has lowered snowpack levels across the state, Bumbaco said. There has been a 25% decrease in snowpack since the 1950s, and there could be a further 50% decline by the end of the century, she said.
 Continuing drought 

A third year of drought could have enormous consequences for the $4.5 billion agriculture economy in the region, which grows 71% of the nation’s hops, 63% of its apples and 62% of its cherries.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimates this year’s water supply for junior water rights holders in the Yakima Basin will be 58%, affecting irrigators in the Roza Irrigation District and Kittitas Reclamation District.
A drought that results in 70% of normal water supply could impact up to 6,000 jobs and result in up to $424 million in direct losses, according to the Department of Agriculture.
Drought is declared in Washington when less than 75% of normal water supply is available and there is risk of “undue hardship” to water users or the environment.
The declaration will open up $4.5 million in drought emergency response grants for public utilities like irrigation districts. Caroline Mellor, statewide drought lead for Ecology, said it’s $1.5 million more than usually provided because of leftover one-time funding in 2023.
Mellor said that Ecology can give out $3 million in the grants per fiscal year when there is a drought declared. The regular emergency funding is important, but Ecology still has a need for funding for drought preparedness and resilience, she said.
 Potential federal impacts to Washington response

Trump administration funding cuts and pauses, and job terminations could impact the state’s ability to respond the drought.
Sixkiller said the state needs “stability and commitment” from its federal partners. Drought response requires partnerships with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation.

Bumbaco said that the state relies on federal government for its data, including on temperature, precipitation, stream flow, soil moisture and snowpack. The data is used for forecasting drought, determining impacts and determining water availability.
“Without accurate data, we can’t reliably forecast supplies,” Sixkiller said.
Federal funding is also essential for projects like water storage, he said.
Sixkiller said Gov. Bob Ferguson is committed to making the state more drought- and climate-resilient.
 Wildfire risk

With drought comes increased wildfire risk.
Matt Dehr, wildland and fire meteorologist for the state Department of Natural Resources, said that prescribed burning has been an effective method for reducing fire risk across the state, and the agency wants to increase its use.
“One thing that a little less precipitation in the winter gives us is that opportunity to do more prescribed burns,” Dehr said.
The low reservoir storage levels are indicators that forests could be stressed from lack of water, he said. Forests stressed from drought, disease and overcrowding are more susceptible to fires.
DNR has shored up its aerial support with a fleet of drones that can map heat and start burns in areas unreachable by firefighters, he said.

I’d known the difficulty of being locked into a job I didn’t want for the sake of health care coverage, and felt the strain of ever-increasing charges for routine preventative care. So when Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi announced that the Affordable Care Act passed, I wept.
The ACA is one of the most consequential health care reforms in our country’s history. It expanded affordable coverage to people previously locked out of health insurance, lowered premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and helped the nation’s uninsured rate reach an all-time low.
But dismantling the law — without any plan to replace it — remains a top Republican priority.
The ACA protects over 100 million people like me with pre-existing conditions from being charged more — or denied coverage entirely — by insurance companies. It guarantees free preventive care for over 150 million Americans and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans. More Americans than ever count on the law. As of 2024,a record 24.2 million Americans are enrolled in quality coverage thanks to the Congressional Democrats who passed tax credits that make health care more affordable for middle-class families purchasing coverage on their own.
But today, we stand at the edge of a health care cliff — again. Republicans want to cancel these tax credits. If they succeed, they would kick 5 million Americans out of the insurance market and spike premiums for the rest of us, just to fund tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.
Unless Congress acts now, premium costs will skyrocket for families across Minnesota, including my own. On average, a Minnesotan family of four would pay $4,000 more for their premiums, and 16,000 Minnesotans will lose their insurance entirely. Our neighbors who are self-employed, small business owners, older adults who don’t yet qualify for Medicare, people living in high-cost rural areas, farmers and people with pre-existing conditions will all suffer — all to finance tax cuts that help primarily benefit the wealthy.
Lower premium costs gave my family more room to pay for other necessities like food and gas. And I know I’m not alone — ACA coverage in Minnesota has more than doubled thanks to the Democrats who have worked tirelessly to protect and expand the ACA. Losing these savings would be devastating to millions who may otherwise not be able to access health care. Families should not have to choose between being able to see a doctor or keeping a roof over their heads.
If Republicans are serious about bringing down costs, they will ensure the ACA tax credits remain available for families for years to come and that people with pre-existing conditions can continue to afford coverage. It is time for Republicans in Congress to get on board and protect the health care of millions of Americans.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1442374624-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

More than 900 students from throughout the U.S., including Indiana, are expected to participate in a national Jobs for America’s Graduates (JAG) Career Development Conference April 24-26 in Indianapolis.
That the conference is being held in our state is worthy of celebration.
Regrettably, the future of JAG in Indiana is in jeopardy. The current Indiana House budget does not include funding for JAG. It is essential that full funding be restored and the day-to-day administration of the program be maintained by local nonprofit workforce development boards.    
JAG is a national workforce preparation program that provides opportunities for success to students who have experienced challenging or traumatic life experiences. Indiana’s JAG program is among the best in the nation. 
The workforce development boards that oversee the program are dedicated to developing, attracting and retaining talent. These organizations are led by regional employers, who often participate in providing JAG students with real-world projects and work experiences. 
Students learn a host of in-demand employability skills and are given a proven bridge to post-secondary education, the workforce or other career enhancing opportunities. In Indiana, JAG was recently expanded to 250 programs and it is expected that 10,000 students will participate annually.
The JAG graduation rate of 96.6% in 2024 was higher than the overall state high school graduation rate of 90.2%. Those who graduated earned $20.4 million in scholarships. 
Moreover, mid-year 2024, JAG statewide registered more than 2,000 engagements with employers. It has a job placement rate of 55.2%, making it a premier generator of talent to meet the needs of employers.
Workforce pipeline
It’s more than an education program. It is an essential multifaceted experience that directly links to building and sustaining the workforces in our region and state. 
Students learn and compete in such areas as career decision making, business planning, financial literacy, project-based learning, and prepared speaking.  
Combined, EmployIndy and the Region 5 Workforce Development Board oversee a total of 48 JAG programs in central Indiana. Ten of our high-achieving JAG students are expected to participate in the national conference. 
Students, like Riley Coots of Pendleton High School, are our future workforce leaders.
“I joined JAG to gain a competitive edge in my professional life,” Coots says. “I have learned the importance of time management, especially when balancing work and school.  Honing my skills and preparing for my next life phase was why I joined JAG; however, I have gained much more than I expected regarding personal growth.”
Adds Lilliana Mendoza of Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis: “JAG gives you a place to be your best. My JAG specialist is very supportive and I think the check-ins (after graduation) will help keep me accountable as I pursue my degree.” 
We are proud to have the national conference in Indiana to celebrate not only the country’s talent but the achievements of our state’s young people under the stewardship of Indiana’s workforce development boards. 
We can ill afford to deny students such a powerful opportunity and ignore the impact of a workforce program that works, especially as our region focuses on supplying our employers with enough skilled talent to ensure a robust economy for years to come.

Matt Lehman, R-Berne (Monroe Bush for Indiana Capital Chronicle)“Financial responsibility,” “accountability” and “transparency” for state government are at the heart of a Republican priority bill that inched closer to the governor’s desk Tuesday.
Sen. Scott Baldwin’s Senate Bill 5 advanced from the House in a bipartisan 91-1 vote. Only Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, was opposed.

Baked in the 21-page measure are new rules for contacts awarded by state agencies — including a ban on non-public, no-bid deals — and steeper expectations for vendors paid with taxpayer dollars.It also mandates “unfilled” government positions be eliminated, and requires state offices to more closely monitor and publicly report on spending, as well as in-flow and out-flow of federal funds.
The measure will need a final signoff from the Senate before it can be sent to Gov. Mike Braun.
“I think this is a good first step (for lawmakers) to sit at the table, and for us to review those things that we’re looking for when it comes to … fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency,” said Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, who sponsored the bill in the House.
More contract scrutiny
The bill is part of a Senate GOP priority bundle and has been coined a “government efficiency” measure by the majority caucus. 
The House-passed plan is “paired down” from the Senate’s draft, Lehman said. Amendments on the chamber floor and in the Ways and Means Committee removed several earlier provisions in an effort to “refine and streamline” the overall bill, and to avoid unnecessary requirements or “inhibitions” on vendor negotiations.
But at its core, the latest draft of the proposal is the same: increase accountability around state contracts.
Except agreements “solely entered into for licensed legal counsel” by executive branch offices, state agencies would no longer be allowed to a grant contracts without a request for proposals (RFP) that is posted on the department’s website for at least 30 days prior to the deal.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle revealed late last year, for example, that multiple no-bid contracts have been awarded by the Secretary of State’s Office.
Secretary of state spending includes millions in no-bid contracts

Reporting showed roughly $4 million in IT-related contract dollars were awarded by the office without RFPs. The agreements do not appear on the Indiana Transparency Portal ​​where such records are typically housed and made public, but a list of contracts has since been published on the secretary of state’s website.
Under the bill, however, all Indiana agencies, statewide offices, local governments, nonprofit organizations and state educational institutions would be required to input contracts into the state’s transparency portal within 30 days of signature. Quarterly reports must additionally be turned in to the state budget committee detailing all of the agency’s active contracts.
State agencies would further be required to undergo budget panel review when making “significant” contract amendments and before applying for new federal funds that require an Indiana match. To better track federal dollars awarded to the state, separate quarterly progress reports to budget regulators would be mandated, too.
State contracts of $500,000 or more would have to include “clearly defined scopes and success metrics” for vendors, along with penalties if expectations and deadlines are not met. Only contracts entered into by the Indiana Department of Transportation for work on highways, roads and bridges would be exempt.
Another provision lets state agencies use artificial intelligence software to prepare required disclosure and projections that must be submitted to state budget regulators.










I think this is a good first step (for lawmakers) to sit at the table, and for us to review those things that we're looking for when it comes to … fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency.


– Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne


As far as office staffing, the bill requires that permanent, full-time positions that have been vacant for 90 days or more must be “reauthorized” — meaning changes are made to the authority, duties or responsibilities in the job listing — or eliminated altogether.
And although Baldwin, the bill author from Noblesville, earlier said his goal was to create a “no-bid list” of companies that are temporarily disqualified from bidding on any more state contracts, such language has since been deleted.
In committee discussions, Lehman maintained “that there are already methodologies” in place for agencies to “sanction or disqualify bad contractors.”
“So, we’re not going to do something statutorily that they can currently do administratively,” he explained.
One Democrat airs concerns
The bill breezed through the House chamber without any floor discussion on Tuesday.
But Dvorak — the only representative to ultimately vote unfavorably — expressed concerns the day prior about exemptions for legal counsel contracts.
“When it comes to legal services, that has been a growing percentage of many departments’ budgets over the last several years — to the extent that there’s often millions of dollars spent on outside legal contracts,” Dvorak said. “I’m sure much of that is for very legitimate purposes. The fact remains, though, that we as legislators need to be aware of what those contracts are, why our state agencies are engaging outside counsel, what that counsel is actually doing, and how much they’re charging. Taxpayers deserve that information, as well.”
 Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, questions a witness in committee on Monday, Feb. 17, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Dvorak said he was especially worried that executive offices could use the carveout to hide critical agreement details and taxpayer dollars spent on attorney contracts.
“I think there’s a way you can exempt the information that might be confidential or covered as work product or attorney-client privilege in the transparency portal, while still having the guts of the contract be public. And that’s the important part,” he continued. “There’s potential for insider dealings here — backdoor deals. I just think you’re creating the opportunity for bad dealings to happen when you make these things exempt from public transparency.”
Lehman clarified, though, that while specifics within counsel agreements “would not necessarily be disclosed, the contract itself would be.” He held that only parts of the contract “that go into the details of the agreement between the attorney and their clients” would be shielded.
“I think the concern here is, can I hide an amount in a contract? The answer is no. … That’s not the intent of this. The intent of this is to make sure we’re protecting client-council privileges,” Lehman said. “Once that contract is adjudicated, I think the amount that you spent — because we have to pay the bill — the amount that was spent will be disclosed.”
Democrats raised other questions about which provisions, if any, would apply to quasi-government agencies like the Commission for Higher Education, Indiana Economic Development Corp. and Indiana Finance Authority.
Some would qualify, Lehman said, but because “a lot” of quasi-agencies contracts require non-disclosure agreements or similar requirements in their contracts, “I think those would be out because of that.”
“The issue we get into … with some of the quasi-governmentals is, where do you stop?” Lehman added. “I think on this bill, overall, we’re trying to go down a path for just (more) integrity and transparency, and we don’t know what we don’t know. And I think we’re going to have the next 10 months to look at how this works, and I think we’ll probably be back next year with some other things that may need to be addressed.”

Mike Braun Tuesday. “If organizations like the Indiana Economic Development Foundation were created to assist state agencies with public business, then Hoosiers need full transparency into how [&#8230;]","Former Gov. Eric Holcomb on a trade mission to Germany and Switzerland funded by the Indiana Economic Development Foundation in 2022. (Photo from IEDF)A secretive state-affiliated nonprofit aiding economic development efforts would have to disclose its funders — retroactively and into the future — under an executive order signed by Gov. Mike Braun Tuesday.
“If organizations like the Indiana Economic Development Foundation were created to assist state agencies with public business, then Hoosiers need full transparency into how these nonprofits operate, who funds them, and what they do with the money,” Braun, a Republican, said in a news release.
“Today’s executive order mandates that these organizations file financial disclosures — including those missed over the past 10 years — so Hoosiers can have full transparency and accountability,” he continued.
The Indiana Economic Development Foundation (IEDF) operates in conjunction with the controversial Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC), a quasi-public state agency.
Indiana had a traditional commerce agency until 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, signed into law legislation creating the IEDC. Shortly after, leaders created the corresponding IEDF, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
The agency and its foundation operate as a public-private partnership.
The foundation has paid for virtually all the international travel for prior governors on economic development trips.
Initially, some donor information was provided. But, in recent years, the foundation has refused to disclose such details.
It does identify some contributors and sponsors on its website, including the state’s “big five” investor-owned utilities: AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy, Indiana Michigan Power and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company.
But how much they give is kept secret.
In 2023, the Capital Chronicle found that outside organizations donated nearly $3 million to the foundation over three years. But who the donors are — and how the agency spends their contributions — is largely unknown. State rules don’t require or outright prohibit disclosure of that information.
A little-known nonprofit boosts Indiana’s economic development agency

The groups behind all but two of 16 transactions in records from 2020 through 2022, obtained by the Capital Chronicle, were permitted anonymity. Two didn’t request anonymity: Washington, D.C.-based think tank The Urban Institute donated $5,000 in 2021, and Indiana’s Battery Innovation Center, in Newberry, gave $12,000 in 2022.
The IEDF also said that, because the funds are private donations, how they’re spent isn’t subject to public records rules.
Julia Vaughn, executive director of watchdog group Common Cause Indiana, said the executive order is an acknowledgment that the IEDC and its foundation have, “for many years, operated behind an opaque curtain of darkness that has created distrust of the agency and its actions.”
“This is a positive step to bring much needed transparency to the IEDC and the projects it supports,” she added.
Other organizations also affected
Braun’s release said the state has created numerous nonprofit groups to supplement agencies, like the Healthy Hoosiers Foundation, Indiana Destination Development Foundation, Indiana State Museum Foundation and more.
All government-affiliated non-profits need to file a Form 990 annually with the IRS that describes where their funding sources, how much they brought in, and how the dollars break down between programs and administrative expenses. This form provides Hoosiers with important transparency into these organizations.
But in 2012, the IEDF got an exemption from the IRS for future filings of the form, according to the release.
State-affiliated foundations are also required to file annual reports with the State Budget Committee — which the IEDF has not done since 2019.
Braun directed all state-affiliated foundations to comply with reporting requirements, including filing any previously missed reports from the past decade, by the end of the year. They must additionally file Form 990s annually, even if they have previously been granted an exemption, retroactive 10 years.
The forms “must be clearly posted on the relevant agency’s website for Hoosiers to read for themselves,” the release says.
A new approach
The governor also signed two other executive orders Tuesday changing Indiana’s approach to economic development.
One is to reassess the economic development regions in the state and better capitalize on regional strengths.
Braun said he wants to spread out economic development efforts geographically, “and one important way we’re doing that is starting from scratch on the map of our state’s economic development regions to better reflect each area’s strengths.”
His order empowers Commerce Secretary David Adams to make recommendations on the redrawing of regional economic development and workforce maps based on an area’s “unique” strengths, assets, workforce capabilities, natural resource and industries.
The second executive order focuses on wage growth and job creation in measuring how effective the state’s economic development strategy is. Those numbers will go in all project proposals and performance reports related to state-supported economic development initiatives.
“Indiana is focusing our economic development efforts on the things that affect your family the most: raising wages and new job opportunities. More jobs, and higher pay: that’s our North Star,” Braun said in the release.
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration focused on capital expenditure and investment totals.

Across Houston, hospitals have been forced to treat hundreds of patients in hallways and corridors as their emergency rooms are being overwhelmed due to the sharp increase in Delta variant cases. Hospitals are straining to keep up with the surge of new coronavirus patients as schools and business's continue to reopen. Houston has seen an upward increase in Delta infections, and research is showing the Delta variant to be 60% more contagious than its predecessor the Alpha variant, also known as COVID-19. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”



Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.










It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician


From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over 30 complaints of government waste and inefficiency in Oklahoma have been flagged as “ideas of note” and considered by House lawmakers during budget discussions. 
House budget chair Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, said the House’s Government Efficiency Portal, which launched in December, received around 250 complaints, but many were “spammy and junk.” 
The portal, which was modeled after President Donald Trump’s federal Department of Government Efficiency, received about 75 actual submissions, about 20% of which are legitimate claims of waste, he said.
Some of the submissions were used in budget hearings to inform questions lawmakers asked of agency directors, he said. 
Some of the “spam” was as simple as what people receive in their email inboxes, Caldwell said, but many were filled with “vitriol against a specific statewide elected officer.” Caldwell said he did not want to name that person.
House leaders voluntarily provided a list of 35 submissions, which they’ve identified as “DOGE Ideas of Note” in response to a request by Oklahoma Voice.
Ideas on the list ranged from consolidating within state agencies to reducing the number of traffic signs on Oklahoma highways. 
Three submissions recommended reducing the number of school districts to consolidate administrative staff and share resources, while another recommended doing the same with the state’s 25 public institutions for higher education. 
Consolidation of state storage and warehouse facilities, state vehicle fleets, and printing services were also recommended. 
Other submissions noted inefficiencies when working with state agencies to obtain car tags, medical assessments, food stamps, childcare, health care and “vital records.” 
One submission said the “over abundance” of unnecessary traffic signs “numbs drivers” and “litter” highways. An example included “speed limit signs increasing over a short distance” because “people know how to speed up.” 
A couple of submissions questioned the need for Oklahoma Turnpike Authority to air television and radio advertisements. Someone else questioned why the OTA and the state Department of Transportation were separate agencies and if there was overlap in services. 
Another recommended comparing job titles of state employees to consolidate duplicative tasks and re-evaluating the salaries of highly paid public servants. 
The submissions provided to Oklahoma Voice only included the submitted idea and not any identifying information about the person using the portal.

The office was established in October to consolidate the public defense offices in all 44 counties into a new statewide agency. The agency was appropriated $52 million in its first year to cover the remaining nine months of the fiscal year, but it has since faced budget shortfalls. 
Senate Bill 1202 addresses those shortfalls, adding $6.7 million in supplemental funding to the 2025 fiscal year budget to pay for transcript costs, additional personnel and contracting costs and funding for Child Protective Act appropriations. It also enhances the 2026 fiscal year budget to $83.2 million. 
 2026 budget addresses contract attorney pay, salary increases by merit

In a blog post on Tuesday, the Office of the State Public Defender thanked the governor, his staff and bill sponsors, Reps. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello; Jon Weber, R-Rexburg; and Sens. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls; and Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, for supporting a budget increase. 
The approved 2026 budget is $5 million less than the amount the governor first proposed after negotiations within the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee. That’s largely because rather than raising the hourly rate for contract attorneys from $100 to $150 — as the governor proposed — the Legislature settled on raising it to $125 per hour. 
Idaho public defender’s proposed budget seeks increases to address defense in rural counties

Of the 39,000 cases the agency has had to cover since it began operation, 9,300 of the cases require a contract attorney. The raise is meant to improve public defense coverage in Idaho’s rural counties, which largely rely on contract attorneys. Likewise, the budget is raising the rate for contracted investigators, who help contract attorneys, from $65 to $85 per hour. 
Attorney shortages remains the agency’s biggest challenge, agency spokesman Patrick Orr told the Sun. 
The budget appropriation seeks to address that challenge, by adding $6.4 million in merit-based salary increases, increasing pay for attorneys handling complex litigation and making wages competitive with similar agencies like the Idaho Office of the Attorney General.
After the agency took over Idaho public defense, the agency changed its pay structure based on an attorney’s length of service. This led several experienced attorneys in Idaho’s more populated regions to resign after receiving pay cuts ranging from $5,000 to $40,000, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
“We need more attorneys,” Orr said. “That’s why we are so thankful for the support from the governor’s office and the Legislature. We’re confident our new salary matrix and increased hourly rate for contract attorneys makes us competitive. Public defense is one of those vitally important jobs in society where you have to find the right people to do the work.  Public defense is not an easy job. It’s hard. But it matters.”

Ed Soliday (center) introduces his amendment to a utility pole attachment measure on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Suit-clad lobbyists on Tuesday offered careful praise for a compromise intended to resolve a long-running fight over the utility pole attachment required to bring high-speed internet to rural Hoosiers and others. Disagreements between electricity and telecommunications providers could muddle more than a billion dollars of government broadband incentives.
“For years, … the most difficult barrier to rural broadband deployment in Indiana has been the math,” said Joni Hart, of Comcast Indiana.
It’s often prohibitively expensive to install broadband infrastructure for few customers situated far apart. But Indiana has poured money into access improvements in recent years — and was allocated a whopping $870 million through the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program to make more progress.
‘Number-one obstructionist’: Electricity co-ops lambasted for slow broadband rollout

Now that the money is taken care of, new obstacles have emerged.
“With this funding committed, our industry and policy makers have more at stake in tackling deployment barriers like permitting and pole attachment issues in order to make sure we get this infrastructure deployed,” Hart added. She said those snags have forced Comcast Indiana to request several extensions from the Indiana Broadband Office for various broadband access projects.
An amendment accepted by consent Tuesday represents “a constructive step forward,” said Daniel Miller, president of Indiana’s Broadband and Technology Association.
The package of changes “reflects a thoughtful effort to balance competing interests while addressing the practical realities of broadband deployment,” Miller continued. “It offers a workable framework that promotes continued investment, innovation and expansion, especially in the areas (of Indiana) that need it most.”
The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s “big five” electric utilities and several natural gas utilities, also said the amended legislation “strikes a balance.”

The edits recast proposed alterations weighed last week, when Indiana’s electric cooperatives were dealt a public tongue-lashing over delays in broadband delivery.
“Good Lord willing, this will be the last time we hear of this issue from now until the Second Coming,” said House Utilities Committee leader Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso.
After Soliday’s overhaul, Senate Bill 502 would give telecommunications providers — the attaching entities — and electric utilities that own 300-plus utility poles a 60-day deadline to meet after a government broadband grant contract is executed.
And they’d have four months to reach a project management agreement after the National Telecommunications Information Administration approves the office’s BEAD proposal.
The legislation now sets detailed deadlines for cooperation if they can’t concur. It would also allow the office to set a “rapid response mediation process” when disputes arise — pulling back from hefty fines considered last week. The office would additionally have to publish broadband grant contracts online shortly after they’re executed.
Indiana Chief Broadband Office Stephen Cox said his office is working on the first round of the complex application process and has wrapped up a series of listening sessions.
“Pole attachments are necessary, in most projects, to bring them to completion,” Cox told the committee. “Our office sees this bill as providing a tool to help expedite pole attachment requests … to facilitate project completion.”

Comcast Indiana’s Hart thanked the committee for cutting the timeline for preparatory work, but said that remained the company’s “primary concern.”
“We realize this isn’t Burger King, and we can’t always ‘have it our way,'” she quipped, “but hopefully that is something that we can work on in the future.”
Soliday, however, said such changes “won’t be in the room,” under his leadership.
“We have worked really hard on this (amendment); it was painful,” he said. “And so, I think we’re in a good place where everyone is equally unhappy. So, spread the joy.”
Senate Bill 502 heads to the House floor after the committee’s unanimous, 15-0 vote.
So does an edited small modular nuclear reactor “pilot” program, on a party-line vote.
The committee lifted a two-project cap within Senate Bill 423 so that any interested developers could participate and bring nuclear to Indiana. The legislation would now block program participants from charging ratepayers for no-cost contributions by third parties.
“We’re sort of de-piloting it, but I can change the U.S. Constitution easier than I can change the title of this bill,” Soliday said at least week’s hearing. “… We are taking it out of the pilot realm.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office of Milwaukee released new information Tuesday regarding the arrests of two undocumented immigrants at the county courthouse. 
A spokesperson wrote in an email statement that Edwin Bustamante-Sierre, 27, and Marco Cruz-Garcia, 24, were arrested by ICE at the courthouse. The statement said that Bustamante-Sierre, a citizen of Nicaragua, was arrested on April 3, and convicted in Fond du Lac County for reckless driving on Dec. 5, 2024. He is currently charged with endangering safety, reckless use of a firearm, use of a dangerous weapon and cocaine possession in Milwaukee County, the email statement read. 
Mexican citizen Cruz-Garcia, the spokesperson wrote, was detained by ICE on March 20. The agency’s statement accuses Cruz-Garcia of being a known member of the “Sureños transnational criminal street gang” and states that he’d been arrested for “multiple criminal charges including breaking and entering, car theft, and assault.” The spokesperson wrote that an immigration judge ordered Cruz-Garcia to be deported to Mexico on Feb. 5, 2020.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Wisconsin Examiner was unable to locate an online court record related to Bustamante-Sierre. For Cruz-Garcia, online court records show a case filed on Jan. 18 involving one count of misdemeanor battery with a domestic abuse modifier. The court record shows that on March 9, Cruz-Garcia was in custody and appeared in court via video, where it was noted that he was indigent. Cruz-Garcia’s case was assigned to another judge and he was turned over for supervison to Justice Point, a non-profit organization which provides a variety of evidence-based criminal justice programs.
All Cruz-Garcia’s prior court orders, including a no-contact order and no possession of firearms, remained in place, as he was required to attend all future court proceedings. On March 20, the day he was detained by ICE, Cruz-Garcia appeared in family court where a domestic violence restraining order was dismissed. 
Days later in early April, there was a courtroom discussion about Cruz-Garcia having been deported to Mexico. Rather than dismissing the case, as defense attorneys asked, Circuit Court Judge Marshall Murray (serving as a reserve for Judge Rebecca Kiefer) granted a prosecutor’s request for a warrant to be issued, according to online court records. An order to review the dismissal of the case against Cruz-Garcia 60 days from April 2 was also issued. 
Courthouses are not immune from the Trump administration’s deportation efforts. On Jan. 21, ICE was directed to conduct “civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.” 
Agents are instructed to conduct enforcement actions “in non-public areas of the courthouse” in collaboration with court security staff, and to use “non-public entrances and exits.” Wherever possible, ICE agents should operate “discreetly to minimize their impact on court proceedings,” the directive states. The order also says ICE agents and officers should avoid actions in or near non-criminal courthouses, such as family or small claims court. 
Last week, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) said in a press statement that it did not participate in the arrests. Although MCSO was aware of the first arrest, the office was not given advance notice of the second arrest. The press release did not name the people who were arrested, and noted that it’s “not uncommon” for law enforcement agencies to search available databases for upcoming court hearings to find targeted individuals.

The courthouse arrests were widely condemned by community members. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said “an attack on this safe, community-serving space undermines public trust, breeds fear among citizens and staff and disrupts the due process essential to our courts.” Senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin Tim Muth echoed concerns that the arrests would create an atmosphere of fear around the courthouse. “Research by the ACLU has shown that when ICE is known to be active in courthouses, members of the immigrant community are less likely to report crimes, less likely to cooperate with police and prosecutors and less likely to make their court appearances,” said Muth. “Our communities become less safe as a consequence.” 
Activists from the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression also expressed concerns about database sharing between local and federal law enforcement, and called for the courthouse to be a safe space for people to come for legal support, services and to seek justice. Over the weekend, at a rally  protesting policies by the Trump administration and Elon Musk, local immigration activists raised those same concerns. “People will be afraid to come to the courthouse if that is not a protected zone,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera during the protest. “And we know that these local fights are our frontline battles.”

Which concepts are so threatening that they need to be banned? Some exist only in fevered imagination. For example, “An individual’s moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex.” Or, for another, “Particular character traits, values, moral or ethical codes, privileges, or beliefs should be ascribed to a race or sex or to an individual because of the individual’s race or sex.” 
Not to be pedantic, but these aren’t concepts; they are propositions. In any case, no one actually teaches such things. It’s as urgent to legislate against these notions as it is to legislate against teaching that the earth is flat, the moon is made of green cheese, and forest fires are caused by Jewish space lasers. Perhaps legislators are confusing ideas that are taken seriously in universities with ideas that have traction on Truth Social.
But to return to hypocrisy: a political party whose members and Dear Leader have pursued electoral success by fomenting social division are now attacking those who advocate for inclusion—or even analyze and teach about it—for supposedly peddling divisive concepts. Even allowing for the usual gap between political rhetoric and reality, this is enough to make one’s head spin.










But to return to hypocrisy: a political party whose members and Dear Leader have pursued electoral success by fomenting social division are now attacking those who advocate for inclusion—or even analyze and teach about it—for supposedly peddling divisive concepts.


Consider a few of the notions that have become standard items in the propaganda toolkit of right-wing Republicans in the last decade, starting with one of Donald Trump’s favorites: undocumented immigrants are rapists, thieves, gangsters, and leeches on the body of America; they are, in Trump’s words, “poisoning the blood” of our country. Perhaps that’s supposed to be a unifying idea. It did, after all, work with some audiences in 1930s Germany.
Demonizing immigrants is just a warm-up. Right-wing Republicans have targeted a host of other groups as enemies. Trump has called the press “the enemy of the people.” His vice-president, J. D. Vance, has called universities and professors “the enemy.” Trump has called protesters “the enemy within,” threatening to use military force against them. During the height of the Covid pandemic, Trump accused medical researchers who found that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective against Covid of issuing a “Trump enemy statement.” 
If North Carolina Republicans haven’t said precisely the same things, neither have they stood up to denounce the divisive statements of their party leader. They’re not likely to, of course, because they employ similar strategies of vilifying LGBTQ people, “woke elites,” doomsaying scientists, public employees, and anyone who has ever relied on our society’s flimsy social safety net. If not for dividing and conquering, they’d have no strategy at all.  
It’s not hard to understand why right-wing Republicans see journalists, scientists, and professors as enemies. These groups are professionally and ethically committed to what is anathema to Trump and his acolytes everywhere: uncovering and telling the truth. When the truth does not accord with the self-serving myths of authoritarians, they try to stifle those who tell it. Taking over the institutions—the press, universities, government research agencies—that support truth-telling is part of the process. It’s an old playbook.
With SB 558, Republican legislators are trying not only to dominate public universities from the outside—as they already do by appointing their backers to the UNC System Board of Governors and controlling the state’s purse strings—but to reach into the classroom and quash academic freedom.
For example, one of SB 558’s forbidden propositions is this: “The rule of law does not exist but instead is a series of power relationships and struggles among racial or other groups.” Put in such simplistic terms, this is not a proposition any college-level instructor is likely to take seriously. But suppose it were rephrased, like so: “The law is made, interpreted, and enforced in ways that reflect inequalities in wealth and power among groups in society, and is often used to reinforce those inequalities.” That’s a proposition for which evidence abounds, and one that deserves serious consideration in a class that deals with such matters.
The problem, however, with SB 588 is that discussion of serious propositions—the rephrased version above—will be chilled and quite possibly never happen. Instructors might rightly fear that some students, disturbed by a challenging idea and emboldened by a foolish law, will bring complaints. Instructors might also fear administrators who are eager to over-comply and issue directives to avoid potentially troubling topics and course content. This isn’t paranoid speculation; it’s already happening in some places.
Another off-limits proposition is that “a meritocracy is inherently racist or sexist.” Again, without nuance or qualification, this is not a proposition professors are likely to use to spark classroom discussion (presuming a course where such a proposition is germane). Yet there is an important idea here, one that would get lost under the corrosive force of SB 588. 
The idea, rephrased as a question, is this: Can what look like meritocratic criteria to members of dominant groups mask biases that advantage members of those groups? Plenty of evidence can be brought to bear on this question, and no place that calls itself a university should be inhibited, to any degree, from tackling the question and examining the relevant evidence. But that’s exactly what SB 558 will do. And it’s not just an abstract notion of academic freedom that will suffer; the damage will be to students and the quality of their education.
Defenders of SB 558 might point to its third “whereas,” which claims that the General Assembly is “committed to ensuring that all North Carolina students enrolled in public institutions of higher education receive a meaningful education based on academic excellence, critical thinking, and the free exchange of ideas.” That would be nice if it were true. But it’s impossible to have it both ways. To say, You can think critically and freely exchange ideas—but here’s a list of ideas you can’t freely exchange or use to think critically, is classic Orwellian doublespeak.
If North Carolina’s Republican state legislators really wanted to take a stand against divisive ideas, there are, in addition to those I noted earlier, plenty to choose from. They could reject the idea, now embraced by the Trump administration, that the First Amendment doesn’t apply to non-citizens legally present in the United States. They could reject the ideas that all Jews are Zionists and that criticism of Israel is antisemitic. They could reject the idea that we can’t have, say, national health insurance because it would mean tax dollars going to undeserving others. These fallacious ideas are enormously divisive, far more so than any at which Republican legislators have taken aim.      
I don’t expect right-wing Republicans to look in the mirror and reform themselves any time soon. In a nation as fraught with inequalities as the United States, the divide-and-conquer strategy has proven too useful to abandon. But the rest of us don’t have to keep falling for it. Everyone who hopes to see our public universities survive as institutions of truth-seeking based on evidence and rigorous analysis should resist. There is an urgent need to change the hands on the levers of power before more damage is done.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC_Legislature_PhotoChenkel-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-09 07:00:14.451130

Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
On Monday health officials announced that Colorado’s second case of measles in was confirmed in an infant in Denver. They warned people who visited the Denver Health emergency room on Sunday that they might have been exposed.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Anti-abortion politicians aren’t just chipping away at reproductive rights; they’re serving as the testing ground for a nationwide ban, even as President Donald Trump insists, they’re leaving it “up to the states.”


Idaho is the latest state to escalate attacks on abortion care, moving to classify mifepristone as a ‘controlled dangerous substance’ — a move mirroring the dangerous legislation in Texas and Louisiana. Meanwhile, lawmakers in those states have pursued criminal charges against a New York doctor for prescribing abortion medication, signaling their intent to prosecute under extreme state laws.


The attack on medication abortion isn’t just intensifying — it’s reaching a crisis point. Anti-abortion politicians are weaponizing junk science and misinformation to target providers and dismantle access state by state. Their playbook is clear: restrict, block and criminalize.


But here’s the thing, we know leaving it “up to the states” creates an unstable patchwork of care that ultimately means people who need abortion care, will go without. Trump’s administration and his appointees continue to attempt to distort science, and manufacture doubt in a perfectly safe form of health care. 


The threat to medication abortion is real, and the consequences are deadly. This fight is no longer about restoring the rights lost with Roe — it’s about ensuring people across all 50 states can access the care they need before it’s too late. 


Medication abortion, which accounts for 63% of all abortions in the United States, has been FDA-approved for over two decades. It involves the use of two medications — mifepristone and misoprostol — and a 25-year track record shows it is one of the safest and most effective medical interventions available. 
It has also revolutionized access to abortion care because patients can consult with a health care provider using telehealth and pick up the pills at a nearby pharmacy or have them delivered to their home. This model of care is not only more affordable but also aligns with the broader trend of patient-centered health care, making essential services accessible to more people regardless of their location or income level.
Studies demonstrate the safety and patient satisfaction with virtual visits, so it is not surprising that this model now makes up 20% of all abortion care.   


That is why anti-abortion lawmakers and opponents are waging a full-scale assault on this critical form of care, leveraging outdated stereotypes, misinformation and antiquated laws to severely limit — or even eliminate — access. 


The consequences of restricting access to medication abortion care are devastating and undeniable. We sit with the heartbreaking stories of Amber Thurman, Porsha Ngumezi, Josseli Barnica and Candi Miller, reported by ProPublica. These women were denied necessary care during early pregnancy loss because of abortion bans. 
Their tragedies highlight the real-world stakes when people cannot access the medical care they need. This isn’t just about the stories of individual women — it’s a cautionary tale for all of us. Denying access to medication abortion care doesn’t just force people to travel across state lines; it can cost them their lives. 


Trump and others have said they will leave abortion rights “up to the states,” but the idea that this is a safe or workable option is a mirage. It ignores the deeply inequitable access to care that state-by-state decision-making perpetuates. 
Lawmakers in Louisiana have established a system that subjects every prescription written for mifepristone and misoprostol to individual scrutiny, thus delaying — or sometimes even denying — access to a medication that is used to manage an early miscarriage, insert an IUD, or start labor for childbirth.  
In Texas, lawmakers have made clear their willingness to criminally charge providers, who prescribe medication abortion via telehealth appointments to people in Texas. Make no mistake, this lawsuit is a direct attempt to chill the willingness of providers in states where abortion is legal to provide care to patients in states where abortion care is unavailable.   


At the federal level, anti-abortion lawmakers are trying to revive the Comstock Act, an outdated 19th-century law designed to restrict the mailing of “obscene” materials. In late December, the U.S. Postal Service affirmed that mifepristone and misoprostol can be mailed legally but left the door open if the Trump administration seeks to twist Comstock into a tool for blocking access to medication abortion.  


This is a clear signal: anti-choice politicians, judges and lobbyists are determined to weaponize every legal and procedural avenue to deny care.  


The stakes couldn’t be higher. To preserve and build back real access to abortion, we cannot afford a puzzle piece of state laws and entanglement of stigma and misinformation. We must focus on the immediate, tangible needs of people today. 
That means ensuring access to mifepristone and misoprostol within all 50 states, decriminalizing pregnancy care, and guaranteeing that people receive the emergency care they need without fear of prosecution. Shield laws —designed to protect providers willing to provide care to people across state lines — are essential, but they are not enough. We need federal protections that ensure access to FDA-approved medication nationwide, not a state-by-state patchwork system established by anti-choice judges and politicians. 


The consequences of inaction are dire. Access to medication abortion care is under relentless attack, and lives are hanging in the balance. This isn’t just about restoring the past; it’s about protecting the future of reproductive health care for generations to come. We must act now with urgency and determination to secure access to this critical care for everyone, no matter what state they live in.

House Speaker Destin Hall said the bill sponsor wanted time to consider amendments to House bill 171.
It prohibits schools and state and local governments from maintaining DEI offices or programs. Diversity and equity could not be considered in awarding contracts. It bans diversity training.
Employees would face civil fines of up to $10,000 for infractions and could be sued for alleged violations. 
After Tuesday’s House session, House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said he hoped the bill would not reappear. 
“I’m hoping that we recognize that this isn’t the kind of thing we need to be concentrating on right now,” he said. “I don’t see any purpose that is served by this bill. I think the House has done an exceptionally good job this year of not getting into these kinds of issues.”
Legislation on DEI and other divisive topics are a distraction from the issue of economic well-being for state residents that should be the legislature’s focus, Reives said. 
“There’s one clear question that everybody has: Why do I have to work two or three jobs to get the same thing my parents did with one job? We keep trying to find ways to keep people distracted from that, and we’ve got to stop that.”
In response to criticisms, Hall (R-Caldwell) maintained that DEI is illegal and unconstitutional, pointing to the 2023 US Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action in college admissions. 
“That same general rule, one would think, applies to hiring decisions,” Hall said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0607-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-09 07:00:14.451130

Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, prepares to present Senate Bill 520 to his fellow senators on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas senators on Tuesday approved a proposed ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) “offices, officers, policies or practices” in local government entities.
Senate Bill 520 would prohibit local governments from promoting:

“Preferences based upon race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin;
Differential treatment on the basis of race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin; or
Political or social activism to consider race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin as factors in decision-making, except when required by federal or state law.”

The bill would allow Arkansans to sue local governments for injunctive relief if the government does not cease violating the mandate within 30 days of being notified.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro is the lead sponsor of SB 520 and earlier this year sponsored Act 116 of 2025. The law repealed requirements that state procurement proposals include language that encourages minority participation or to adopt an equal opportunity hiring program designed to increase the percentage of minority employees.
Sullivan claimed Act 116 would force public entities to prioritize “merit” over “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
The language of SB 520 aligns both with Act 116 and with Arkansas ACCESS, a higher education overhaul bill approved in March, Sullivan told the Senate City, County and Local Affairs Committee on Tuesday morning. ACCESS prohibits institutions of higher education from “comply[ing] with any institutional accreditation requirement related to DEI.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sullivan told both the committee and the full Senate that Arkansas should align itself with the federal government’s stance on DEI. President Donald Trump’s January executive order declared an end to all DEI “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities” in federal agencies.
Arnessa Bennett, North Little Rock’s DEI officer, told the committee that she and the city oppose SB 520. She said it would discourage local governments from holding events in partnership with organizations that have DEI policies.
“We feel like you’re violating our First Amendment rights in telling us that we cannot say anything about DEI,” Bennett said. “…It’s almost like we’re being censored.”
The all-Republican committee passed the bill with no audible dissent. The committee also approved the addition of an amendment to the bill, stating: “This section does not prevent compliance with any state or federal civil rights laws or any agreement related to the receipt of state or federal funding.”
Bills usually are not heard by the full House or Senate until at least a day after passing committees, but Sullivan asked the Senate to suspend the rules so SB 520 could receive a vote Tuesday evening.
Twenty-two of the 29 Republican senators voted for SB 520. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, joined the six Senate Democrats in voting against the bill. GOP Sens. Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs and Jim Petty of Van Buren voted present, and four more Republicans did not vote.
Sen. Reginald Murdock, D-Marianna, was the only senator to speak on the bill before the vote. He also spoke against Act 116 in January, and he said Tuesday that the state should not “bring this craziness all the way to the local level.”
“Let’s allow local control to make their decisions on how they want to deal with their communities,” Murdock said.

Measles cases are on track to reach a 34-year high as vaccine hesitancy spreads and funding cuts imperil state responses. (Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune)Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.











Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health



Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)When Ellie O’Keefe moved to Oak Hill in Fayette County, West Virginia, she was surprised how difficult it was to find child care.
“I was very surprised, coming from a much more suburban area, to be faced by this lack of child care,” she said.
More than 25,000 children in West Virginia don’t have access to child care, and more than 150 child care providers have closed their classrooms over the last year. There are also concerns about the state’s long-term plan to fund its subsidy program that helps working parents pay for child care. 
Parents, child care workers, the state’s business leaders and some Republican and Democrat lawmakers have asked for bills and funding to address widespread issues. 
Another legislative session is likely to end with no movement on the issue.
“Well, none of our bills made it through, so I think that says a lot about priorities,” said Pamela Shope, site director for Playmates Preschools and Child Development Centers, which operates six centers in Cabell and Wayne counties. 
O’Keefe, pregnant with her second child, stood in the lower rotunda of the state Capitol on Tuesday for Child Care Day. A sticker on her T-shirt said, “I am a child care voter.”
“Families are really struggling in ways they haven’t in the past,” she said. “It is another year where we’ve been told that this was going to be a priority, and nothing has really shifted.”
It feels like déjà vu for those hoping for changes after last year the Republican-led legislature failed to send a stack of child care-focused bills to the governor’s desk for consideration. Lawmakers, at former Gov. Jim Justice’s urging, did approve a Child Care Tax Credit in 2024, and it’s available to families who already claim the federal child care tax credit.
“I’m disappointed,” said Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, who sponsored several child care measures. She said the House of Delegates’ focus on budget constraints had partially held up the measures. “It’s not over till midnight on Saturday, so there’s always hope, but I won’t be surprised if nothing happens.”
West Virginia has the nation’s lowest rate of women serving in a legislature, which Crouse believes has impacted the House’s action on child care.
“Unfortunately, the majority of the body are men, and they don’t have to deal with these issues,” said Crouse, a mother who chose to leave the workforce to stay home with her children. “I’m not saying they don’t care about them. I just don’t think they have the same pull and realize what it takes and what’s needed.” 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, is a mom of two and at one time was the only mother of young children serving in the House. She has championed child care legislation during the last few years. 
“I don’t think we have any women who are chairs of major committees in the House, and it’s obviously not a priority of this super majority,” Young said. 
“Feels like another year with all the same excuses,” she continued. “We still haven’t done anything for child care.”

Child care measures stalled in session’s final week  
The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce has backed child care measures, saying it’s necessary to improve the state’s abysmal workforce participation rate. Others pushing for child care expansion point to the importance of early childhood learning and resources in a state with a high rate of poverty and babies impacted by the substance abuse crisis.
There were a number of child care measures introduced this year, particularly in the House.
House Bill 2731, sponsored by Crouse, would create the Employee Child Care Assistance Partnership, where the state would partner with child care employers to offset their employees’ child care costs. The program is meant to help centers retain workers and keep classrooms open. 
Shope said the measure would have “a huge impact to help retain staff.”
The average annual cost of care at a licensed child care center in West Virginia is more than $6,000 per child. 
“Child care is very expensive, and we do give our teachers and staff employee discounts … but it’s still very hard,” Shope said, adding that employees at her centers can make too much to qualify for the state’s child care subsidy program. 
“We want to have the highest quality child care that we can provide for our families, and sometimes it’s difficult to find a good, qualified teacher that wants to work in child care. We need all of the benefits that we can to get them to stay,” she said. 
The bill remains parked in the House Health Committee with the legislative session set to adjourn Saturday.
Crouse also introduced legislation, House Bill 2730, to establish a pilot program where the state, an employer and an employee each pay one-third of total child care costs. It’s known as a “tri-share model” for child care. The program is currently being piloted in eight counties. The bill, which would have cost roughly $10 million, is unlikely to make it to the full House of Delegates for consideration.
Del. Bob Fehrenbacher, R-Wood, who serves on the House Finance Committee, said there wasn’t one single thing that had derailed child care measures this session. 
“I do think there are some tax considerations, you know, with the structural deficit, but there are some of the options that I think would be OK. Let’s get started on this,” he said. “Yes, there may be some tax implications, but there also ought to be some benefits, such as more people being in the workforce.” 
Fehrenbacher sponsored multiple bills aimed at tackling the state’s child care issues, including a measure that would increase the tax credit for employers providing child care for employees. His child care bills weren’t considered by House committees.
“Frankly, I’m disappointed,” he said.

Long-term funding for child care 
While the House budget increases funding for child care in fiscal year 2026, Young is concerned that the state’s subsidy program is facing a July 1 funding cliff, which she said could result in thousands of children being removed from the program. During House budget negotiations last week, she tried to amend the budget bill to include around $32 million for the child care subsidy program. The House voted down her amendment.
“[It] means we’ll have more parents out of the workforce. It means we’ll have more centers closing,” Young said. 
Fehrenbacher said testimony from Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer led him to believe the program will be funded throughout the year, but there’s still a question mark about the long-term funding amid the state’s child care issues. 
“We need other options. So, things like the tax incentives for an employer or the tri-share model are things that are out there that I think could have helped give us options,” he said. 
O’Keefe hopes the state will work to address the affordability of child care.
“We’re looking for the best opportunities for our children. We’re looking for the freedom to be able to go to work,” she said. 
“Just because you don’t see these parents coming to the Capitol doesn’t mean that they don’t want to speak up … They often are not able to come to this stage because they’re working and because they have child care,” O’Keefe continued. “Their voices deserve to be heard.”

In Northwest Tennessee, Dyer County issued a mandatory evacuation order Monday for Bogota and surrounding communities due to the “imminent threat of flooding.” More than 100 residents of West Memphis, Arkansas, had been rescued from their homes as of Sunday.
Officials in Memphis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, are closely monitoring the rising water after already suffering damage from several days of flash floods. Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee have active federal disaster declarations after tornadoes, high winds, and heavy rain in early April, according to FEMA. Kentucky and Missouri also have disaster declarations for previous storms over the past few months.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in flood fight mode, which allows them to provide equipment and assistance to local authorities, said Drew Smith of the Corps’ Mississippi Valley Division. Multiple tributaries of the Mississippi River in the Memphis District saw “unprecedented rainfall,” including the St. Francis/Little River basin and the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie rivers, Smith said.
“After three years of drought along the mighty Mississippi, and no substantial high water along our river since April of 2023, what we’ve seen in the last week or so has been torrential rain impacts of much of the lower main stem,” Blytheville, Arkansas, Mayor Melisa Logan said during a Monday news conference hosted by the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative.
Logan is the Arkansas state chair of the nonprofit organization, which represents local leaders in flood-prone cities and towns along the river, and has been lobbying in Washington, D.C. for more funding for flood control projects. 
MRCTI executive director Colin Wellenkamp said the organization has multiple flood mitigation projects that have created 100,000 new acres of natural flood storage underway from La Crosse, Wisconsin down to Louisiana. Some of those projects helped absorb floodwaters — and risk — during this event, he said.
Cities in Missouri, Tennessee report significant damage
Northwest Arkansas received rainfall in the double digits between April 2 and April 5, Logan said. Her region saw some flooding, but fared better than other cities along the river. 
Memphis Mayor Paul Young said the city received 12 inches of rain, causing flooding, downed trees and power outages.
“Thankfully, our teams worked really hard, and they were very responsive and very prepared for the storms that took place,” he said. “When you have that level of rainfall, it’s hard for our systems to be able to drain the water at a speed that is necessary.”
Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and several small towns in Cape County suffered significant damage from flooding and at least one tornado, Mayor Stacy Kinder said.
The Big Muddy River, a tributary of the Mississippi River running through Southern Illinois, is seeing its highest flood levels in years. Cape Girardeau has opened up green space over the last several years to create natural flood storage areas to the north of the city, Kinder said.
While those projects have helped retain some of the floodwater, Cape Girardeau’s water treatment system can’t keep up. The system typically treats around 26 million gallons over the span of a few days. Between April 2 and April 6, it treated 91 million gallons, Kinder said.
The excessive volume caused a 24-inch sewer main to break near the river’s edge, and repairs are on hold until the sewer system can begin to drain.

“We have managed to mitigate leakage as long as our lift station remains operational, so prayers and cross fingers on that,” Kinder said. “We’re hoping that the impacts are not too tremendous there, but it’s a big deal.”
The city has closed its Mississippi River floodgates in anticipation of a 37-foot flood stage, and city pump stations will be continuously manned to continue moving water out of downtown, she said.
Mitigation measures softened the blow for some towns
Mayor Nick White of New Madrid, Missouri, said his community saw over a foot of rain in  some areas, and flooding caused some power outages and sewer issues. The city used its  gravity drains – pipes or drains that use gravity to direct water down slopes and away from structures – early in the flood event and filled 50,000 sandbags out over five days, White said. Minimal homes were flooded. 
“It could have been a lot worse and I’m thankful for the outcome that we’ve had thus far,” White said.
The river is expected to reach 41.5 feet at its peak; flood stage for New Madrid is 34 feet.
In Osceola, Arkansas, Mayor Joe Harris Jr. reported “minimal damage.” The city had been working on storm drain improvements for the past three months, “and we just happened to get ahead of the curve,” he said.
Tiptonville, Tennessee closed its flood gates Monday morning, Mayor Cliff Berry said. The town has experienced minimal damage so far, but nearby Obion County was not so lucky. Rives, a small town that suffered significant flooding in February, is once again filled with water, he said.
Horseshoe Lake in East St. Louis, Illinois, took on about 500 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, protecting five cities in the area, Wellenkamp said. At the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, a flood storage project that is not yet complete still took on some water, diverting it from Grafton, Illinois and Alton, Missouri.
Flood reduction structures along the Big Muddy River are helping slow and store flood water that would otherwise run through Cape Girardeau, Wellenkamp said. A new forest being built in West Memphis should take pressure off of roadways and North Memphis flooding, he said.
“All of this adds capacity and it reduces overall risk, and it creates a situation that would be less impactful than otherwise,” Wellenkamp said. “We’re happy to report that these projects, even though some of them are in progress, are working and doing what they’re designed to do.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)State lawmakers will consider a proposal this spring to let the governor add two at-large members to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, requiring voters to give up power they currently have to elect all members of one of the state’s most powerful political institutions.  
House Bill 364, sponsored by Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville, is a proposed constitutional amendment to allow the governor to hand select two additional members to the commission that regulates utilities in Louisiana. The body is currently composed of five members, each elected from their respective multi-parish districts.    
The two gubernatorial appointees would be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms. The five elected commissioners are currently limited to three consecutive six-year terms. 
The five LPSC districts are larger and more populous than Louisiana’s six congressional districts, giving the commissioners significant influence on matters of everyday concern to a large number of residents, though any at-large commissioners would have far greater influence than the current five.  
The commission determines how much utilities can charge their customers for their services that include electricity, water, gas, cable television, phone and internet service. A utility provider needs LPSC approval before raising rates or adding any kinds of fees to customers’ bills.  
The most important election in Louisiana that many don’t even know about

The commission oversees major investor-owned utilities such as Cleco and Entergy Louisiana, as well as smaller, member-owned power cooperatives such as DEMCO. Its regulatory umbrella covers the entire state, save for a handful of city-owned utilities and private service providers in New Orleans and other cities, which fall under the jurisdiction of local governments. 
LPSC members also have oversight of intrastate oil pipelines, tow truck services and moving companies. Each commissioner is supposed to represent constituents in their districts in any disputes they have with utility companies. 
“It only takes three members to control rates over the entire state,” Deshotel said, referring to the three-vote majority needed for a measure to pass on the five-member panel. “I just think we need more representation.”
Some are skeptical of the proposal. 
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican and former state senator from Lafayette, said he has great respect for the legislative process and his former colleague but doesn’t think the addition of two appointed members would accomplish Deshotel’s stated intention of increasing representation. 
“They wouldn’t be answerable to a constituency, so it kinda defeats the purpose of his goal,” Coussan said. “I don’t see how two appointees who only answer to the governor would accomplish that.”
Coussan said Deshotel’s proposal would drastically overhaul an institution that works with companies and residents through regulatory processes that have been relatively consistent over the years. Such changes would send a discouraging message to the major stakeholders investing in Louisiana who are familiar with and rely on the LPSC’s stable regulatory environment, he added.
Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, questioned Dehotel’s motives, saying the governor is the only person who would gain representation and power under the proposal.
“It truly dilutes the people’s will by reducing their vote,” Lewis said. “If it was truly about representation, wouldn’t he just make the districts smaller by adding [elected] members?”
Louisiana’s largest industries tired of waiting for renewable energy

During the most recent round of redistricting in 2022, the legislature chose to keep the number of LPSC members at five. There were no proposals to add elected members to the commission, but there were some that sought to redraw the map to include a second majority-Black district. Lawmakers ultimately rejected those measures.
Deshotel said adding appointed rather than elected members would keep out the vast amounts of campaign cash that special interests have used to influence LPSC elections, though he hedged his statement by saying he doesn’t think that it has affected any of the current commissioners.
“These are extremely expensive elections, and most of the donations come from the same people that they’re regulating,” Deshotel said.
He added that he plans to file a campaign finance reform bill targeting LSPC elections in the future if his constitutional amendment stalls at the Capitol this year. 
Constitutional amendments require two-thirds support from each chamber of the legislature and final approval from Louisiana voters during a statewide election. The 2025 legislative session starts Monday.

Thousands of Michigan children could lose free meals under proposed cuts by congressional Republicans that would make it more difficult for schools to provide universal free meals, according to state officials.
GOP lawmakers want to change an existing federal program that makes subsidized meal programs more efficient and accessible by allowing schools in impoverished communities to qualify to offer free meals to all students, as opposed to independently verifying each student’s family income.
Currently, schools must show 25% of their students are enrolled in other aid programs like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to qualify for community eligibility. House Republicans want to raise the requirement to 60% of students.
Republicans say they want to make the change to ensure only the neediest students get free school meals. The cuts to the program were raised by the House Budget Committee Chair U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington last month.
The proposals would save $12 billion over a decade, according to a list circulated by Arrington. An official federal budget has not been proposed yet.
The nearly 600,000 Michigan students who currently qualify through the current federal community eligibility program could lose access to free school meals, according to the Michigan Department of Education.
The actual number of students who would lose free school meals would likely be lower because some schools would still qualify for community eligibility under the proposed new guidance. Some students also qualify for other aid programs.
Over the last few years, Michigan has provided free school meals to all students, allocating around $200 million in state funds annually to bridge the gap in federal programs. Proposed legislation to make universal free school meals permanent in the state failed to move forward.
Overall, more than 850,000 Michigan children rely on free public school lunches and more than 474,000 eat breakfast in school.
If the proposed federal cuts were to become law, many students in the state would be negatively impacted, officials from the MDE said Tuesday during a presentation to the State Board of Education. It could also lead to schools serving lower quality, less nutritious meals to students due to budget constraints.
“The health of our Michigan students is at risk,” said Diane Golzynski, deputy superintendent for business, health, and library services for the MDE, during the board meeting.
Additionally, Republicans want to change federal regulations to allow local schools just 10 days after they receive a completed application to determine if a family is eligible for free or reduced meals.
The law currently only requires schools to get income verification for 3% of the applications it receives. The proposed changes would make schools verify the incomes of all families who apply.
“Imagine how a district would be able to take on this monumental task in that very short, federally regulated time frame of 10 days,” said Deanne Kelleher, director of the MDE’s Office of Health and Nutrition Services, during the board meeting.
There is also concern families may not apply if they are asked to provide personal information every school year, given data security concerns, she added.
Fewer families applying for free meals will negatively affect the amount of federal Title I and state at-risk funding schools receive, Kelleher said.
Proposed plans would also end summer feeding programs, which provide food for students and families. In 2024, the programs helped feed 3.9 million Michigan households.
“This proposal could continue to contribute to the rise in food insecurity for households with children,” said Kelleher.
One in six Michigan children face food insecurity, according to the nonprofit Feeding America.
Dawn Pully, food service director for Bendle Public Schools, where 88% of students are from impoverished families, said during the meeting the only meals some children eat are provided by their schools.
“I don’t even want to think about telling our students that they have to pay or that they can’t eat because they owe money,” she said.
Making the federal program more restrictive will have two major consequences, Pulley said.
“Parents, for sure, will not follow the correct steps to be approved, which will punish the student,” she said.
School nutrition staff also will be forced to spend many more hours completing paperwork, taking away from time they spend focusing on creating healthy menu options for students.
Universal free school meals can boost attendance, increase test scores, and decrease suspensions, research shows.
Richard Browder, director of student nutrition for Brighton Public Schools, said during the meeting he’s seen the positive impact universal free school meals programs have had on students.
“I’ve watched students who used to come in late now arrive early for breakfast every single morning,” he said. “I’ve seen high schoolers who used to skip lunch because they didn’t want to be singled out for free meals now eating with their peers with pride, because every student gets the same meal, no stigma attached.”
Michigan students also were impacted by the abrupt cut of $30 million in grants to programs that helped schools buy food from local farms.
Additionally, 118 truckloads of food were canceled for a federal food assistance program the MDE administers, said Golzynski.
Tiffany Tilley, a member of the board, said during the meeting the cuts and the proposed changes to the federal meal program are “an absolute travesty.”
Board President Pamela Pugh said the cuts are “cruel” and “callous.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Montgomery County group filed a formal complaint with the Tennessee Ethics Commission against state Rep. Aron Maberry, saying he has a conflict of interest as a state House and local school board member.
The group says Maberry, a Clarksville Republican, should resign from the Clarksville Montgomery County School Board, mainly because of his votes in support of state legislation that could discriminate against immigrant students. The complaint, which was filed April 3, bases its argument on Maberry’s vote for House Bill 793, which allows school districts and charter schools to refuse to enroll students without permanent legal documentation, contradicting a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that guarantees all children access to public education.
“By supporting this bill, Mr. Maberry has violated the School Board Code of Ethics, specifically his duty to provide equal education opportunities and to refrain from using his position for partisan gain,” the complaint says.
The group, which includes current and former educators, Catherine Garrigan, Joy Rice, Karen Reynolds, Katherine Lawson and Jeri Hiley-Britain, says in the filing the bill could violate federal laws prohibiting discrimination based on race, color or national origin and risks losing $1.1 billion in federal education funding for Tennessee.
The filing alleges several ethics violations against the first-term representative of House District 68, including failure to uphold student rights and represent the entire school community, allowing partisan influence to affect his votes, undermining diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as failure to prioritize student needs.
Maberry, who voted Monday in favor of the bill restricting immigrant student enrollment, issued a statement saying, “This complaint is without merit and clearly politically motivated. It’s a desperate stunt by woke local leftists who reject the conservative values our community holds dear and that I proudly represent at the Capitol. They are obsessed with overturning the will of the people; all of their previous attempts have failed. I have been fully transparent about my service on the school board and my intention to serve out the remainder of my term. I have full confidence in the Ethics Commission and trust the facts will lead to an appropriate course of action.”
Monday’s meeting of the House Government Operations Committee was interrupted by ministers who recited the Lord’s Prayer in protest of the bill, which passed 8-7.
The issue has roiled the legislature all year, leading opponents to rally against multiple Senate and House committee votes.
The Senate version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson, chairman of the finance committee, would require school districts to check the immigration status of students and charge them tuition to enroll. The House bill sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland would give districts the option to check immigration status.
Lawmakers have said they want to pass the measure to challenge Plyler v. Doe at the Supreme Court level, the 43-year-old ruling that requires school districts to serve all students.

The House Judiciary Committee opted Tuesday to postpone legislation until 2026 enabling Bayer/Monsanto to avoid liability in lawsuits connected to cancer claims. Republican Rep. Clay Doggett of Pulaski called for the delay less than a week after the full Senate passed its version of the bill.
“I felt like there was a lot of stakeholders, there was a lot of questions that we had that didn’t get answered,” Doggett said Tuesday.
Tennessee bill would expand weed-killer manufacturers’ legal immunity 

Germany-based Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, recently agreed to pay nearly $2.1 billion to a man who claimed he contracted non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma from Roundup. Some 170,000 similar lawsuits have been filed against the chemical company.
Under the legislation, though, as long as a pesticide manufacturer’s federally-approved label doesn’t warn of a disease, they couldn’t be held liable for causing an illness. 
Farmers in his rural Middle Tennessee district supported the bill, Doggett said. Yet lawmakers were overwhelmed with information about the bill, making it difficult to bring it to a vote this year, he said.
For instance, Republican Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood attorney, told lawmakers a provision in state law gives people standing to sue in federal court. Doggett also added that he favors an amendment to the measure that dropped a “blanket immunity” provision for the companies involved. 
Doggett conceded that farmers could be “more prone” to contract illnesses from spraying the pesticide/herbicide. Yet he said farmers in his district support the legislation and use of the chemical, and he added that other lawmakers said foreign countries will continue using the product on their crops even if it vanishes in America.
Farmers and the Farm Bureau testified previously that the Roundup used in modern agriculture enables no-till farming on larger tracts, which is considered a more efficient method.
The House bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern in West Tennessee, called the outcome “part of the legislative process.”

“There’s lots of questions people have that they didn’t feel like they got adequate answers to, so knowing that, we’re at the end of the session now, so there’s not a whole lot of time to get answers,” Grills said.
The bill can be brought back for consideration in 2026 since it wasn’t voted down.
Critics have said they believe it gives Bayer and Monsanto blanket immunity to lawsuits. 
But Grills said rather than a giveaway to the company, the legislation would put an end to frivolous lawsuits and stave off a day when farmers can’t use preferred products because of the threat of legal action against manufacturers.
“I’m one of those farmers. We use these products, and because we use those products, we’re able to make a living,” Grills said.
A Tennessee Farm Bureau lobbyist testified recently that the Senate bill would avert only cases involving product labels approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Opponents of the legislation say it will remove people’s constitutional rights to a jury trial when they’re diagnosed with deadly illnesses caused by the product.
Legislatures in Iowa, Missouri, Idaho, Wyoming and Mississippi have turned down similar bills, yet Bayer-Monsanto hasn’t pulled products from shelves, leaving opponents to say the chemical maker is more concerned with increasing earnings than protecting people.
The Tennessee Trial Lawyers Association testified in the Senate that opponents don’t believe the products should be banned, only that customers should maintain their right to take legal action.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Union nurses at UnityPoint Health-Meriter hospital in Madison rallied Tuesday, warning that they would strike if they can’t reach a satisfactory labor agreement in their current contract talks.
The rally was held in advance of a bargaining session scheduled for Wednesday between the hospital and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents about 800 nurses at the hospital.
The nurses are currently working without a contract after their previous agreement expired March 16 and was extended to March 23.
The union is highlighting its demands for written language addressing safety issues, said Pat Raes, SEIU Wisconsin president and a nurse for 35 years at Meriter.
“We are fighting for the safety of every last person there. And part of that in today’s society when rules are being turned upside down, inside out, and backwards, means that we have to find ways to make sure that our safety is codified,” Raes said at the Tuesday afternoon rally. “And one of those ways to do that is with having a contract that talks about safety.”
Sherry Casali, chief nursing executive and vice president of patient care at the hospital, said in a statement Tuesday that the hospital management is “committed to working with SEIU WI to address their concerns through a fair contract that both parties can support.”
The statement said the hospital has implemented a number of safety and security measures and has competitive salaries for nurses.
 Raes said the hospital has safety plans, but that nurses want those plans to go farther, including being enshrined in the labor agreement. She said the union wants to see guaranteed staffing ratios in the name of patient safety as well.
“We are preparing if needed to move forward to a strike,” Raes said. “These nurses are ready to strike. Let me tell you — they are not afraid. But we do not want to strike if we don’t have to.”
To date, the union has not issued a formal strike notice.

(Getty Images)As someone who has lived through the West Virginia foster care system from the inside — not as a policymaker, but as a foster and pre-adoptive parent — I read Jaycie Bias’ recent comments in West Virginia Watch with a heavy heart.
In the April 3 article covering the proposed $30 million budget cut to foster care, Ms. Bias, Executive Director of the WV Foster, Adoptive & Kinship Parents Network, was quoted saying:
“Funding isn’t the issue… The state is doing so little for us in terms of follow through that you are having people fall through the cracks.”
I appreciate her service and understand her frustration. But respectfully, this framing is not only inaccurate — it’s dangerous.
Funding is the issue — the foundational issue. And to downplay that fact doesn’t just mislead readers. It risks giving political cover to those defunding the very system our most vulnerable children rely on.
The West Virginia Department of Human Services itself warned that the proposed cuts would “significantly hinder critical services.” We’re talking about caseworkers, placement options, therapy access, and basic oversight. These are not optional extras — they are the infrastructure of child protection.
When Child Protective Services fails to follow the law — and believe me, they have failed my family and many others — it’s not simply incompetence. It’s the predictable outcome of chronic underfunding and overwork.
West Virginia currently has one Guardian ad Litem (GAL) for every 200 children in custody. How is that tenable? One legal advocate for 200 children. How can a child’s voice be heard under those conditions?
Yes, accountability matters. But it’s a hollow demand if we ignore the structural rot underneath.
I’ve witnessed firsthand how CPS has violated the rights of children and caregivers. I’ve seen a child be denied essential medication. I’ve watched as decisions were made behind closed doors, with no legal justification. And I’ve written legislation — the West Virginia Foster Care Accountability Act — to try and prevent these abuses from repeating.
But reform without funding is performance. And blaming “follow through” while ignoring the missing foundation is like patching drywall in a burning house.
To the WV Foster, Adoptive & Kinship Parents Network: You represent my family and 1,800 others. Please don’t use your platform to deflect attention from the real crisis — a crisis rooted in budget cuts, staff shortages, and resource deprivation.
To legislators: You cannot cut your way to a better foster care system. You are not reducing waste — you are increasing trauma.
To families: You are not alone. The system is flawed, but you are not crazy. Your frustration is justified. And your advocacy matters.
Let’s stop pretending we can solve foster care with platitudes and penny-pinching.
Let’s fix it — for real — with accountability, protection, and yes, adequate funding.

(Murray State photo)Legislation to create schools of veterinary and osteopathic medicine in Kentucky went nowhere in the recently-adjourned General Assembly, but lawmakers did open a path for more public universities to offer such professional and advanced degree programs. 
Senate Bill 77, which received bipartisan support in the General Assembly and was signed into law by Gov. Andy Beshear, allows the state’s comprehensive universities for the first time to seek approval to start professional programs such as medicine or architecture and to offer doctor of philosophy degrees. 
The new law also creates a framework for the Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) to review a university’s proposal and make a recommendation to the legislature about whether it is viable and should be funded.
Eastern Kentucky University wants to open a school of osteopathic medicine and aims to graduate its first class of physicians in 2034. Murray State University has been working to win approval to open a veterinary medicine school and got a boost last year when the legislature allocated $60 million to construct a new veterinary sciences building now in the design phase.
Western Kentucky University wants to start research doctoral programs.
All of those proposals were introduced as bills during the recently concluded 2025 regular session. None received a committee hearing; instead, lawmakers created a process for deciding when the state needs such programs and to consider the costs.
Needs of students, state
The framework outlined in the law allows lawmakers to have in-depth information, particularly about the financial stability and viability of a proposal, before voting to fund a new program, said Sen. Matthew Deneen, an Elizabethtown Republican.
  Sen. Matthew Deneen (LRC Public Information)
In an interview, Deneen said the legislation “was an opportunity to expand the opportunity” for comprehensive universities in the state to offer more doctoral programs. Besides EKU, Murray and Western, the comprehensive universities are Morehead State and Northern Kentucky universities.
“It’s important to have a framework like this and guidelines in place so that we can make better decisions for the people of the commonwealth, for our students, because ultimately the things that we’re doing here are going to impact the offerings at these comprehensive universities,” Deneen said. “And it’s going to allow them to meet the goals of not only their students but of the overall commonwealth.”
The new law directs CPE to review how the proposed program would align with the goals and mission of the university, the statewide or regional need for the program and demand by students and employers for the program. Universities must also show CPE how the program compliments existing programs, provide a five-year budgetary analysis, possible curriculum and more. 
Before submitting a new proposal, the law says that a comprehensive university must meet some student success measures such as having a first-to-second year retention rate and a six-year graduation rate that is in the 75th percentile of all comprehensive universities nationwide and the 80th percentile of all comprehensive universities within the Southern Regional Education Board. 
Now, CPE is creating policies to determine the eligibility for the new professional programs. Travis Powell, vice president and general counsel of CPE, said the process will likely be similar to how CPE has approved other academic programs in the past.

“Right now we are in the process of determining initial eligibility … to see who is even eligible to offer programs based on the student success measures that have to be in place and the reserve funding they have to keep,” Powell said. 
Under the new law, CPE can recommend if proposals that will include a funding request to the General Assembly should be funded, Powell said. CPE already makes biennial budget requests to the legislature. The next state budget will be considered in 2026. 
University plans
EKU’s plan to open an osteopathic medicine school would include asking the legislature for nearly $50 million to meet accreditation requirements for reserve funds. 
EKU President David McFaddin told the Lantern the university’s work starts this spring to verify data needed for CPE’s review of the proposal as well as gaining a pre-accrediation status with the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA). While McFaddin acknowledged it is an “aggressive timeline,” EKU plans to have the first class of students graduating in 2034.
The law does “open the door” for all of the state’s comprehensive universities to offer degrees that “may connect back with the overall needs of Kentucky,” McFaddin said. 
“I think at the end of the day for our public institutions, making sure that we’re mapping those degree programs to our community needs to our workforce needs to our economic needs are critically important,” he added.

Murray State recently praised the passage of Senate Bill 77 as the university works toward opening a veterinary medical school. 
In a statement to the Kentucky Lantern, Murray State said a task force will review the development of a course of study for the professional degree program and that the university is “very grateful” to lawmakers and the governor for supporting the bill. 
WKU also praised the passage of the new law, “which moves WKU one step closer to offering PhD programs as we pursue Carnegie R2 status,” said Jace Lux, a university spokesperson in an email. The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 created a classification system for institutions. R2 designates mid-level research universities. R1 is the highest level and includes the University of Kentucky and University of Louisville.
“The CPE is currently developing a process to review and approve new PhD programs,” Lux said. “Once that process is finalized and shared with us, we will begin seeking approval for our first PhD in the field of Data Science.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/science-complex.webp,,,2025-04-09 06:01:36.706801

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs [&#8230;]","Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunita Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury) Research colleges and universities in Virginia are at risk of taking significant cuts, state lawmakers in the House of Delegates and education experts revealed Tuesday, as the country’s executive branch continues to trim down operations and funding in the federal government.
According to data collected by the National Center for Science and Engineering, Virginia ranks 13th in the nation in research and development (R&D) performance. 


Virginia’s federal workforce breakdown
Federal jobs and contracting equal 16.1% of all full-time and part-time jobs in Virginia.
– 321,516 federal full-time civilian jobs
– 130,751 armed forces
– 441,488 Virginian jobs directly depend on federal contracting

“R&D is important to Virginia, and changes in federal R&D funding and policies will have ripple effects on your entire state and the Virginia Public and Land Grant Universities,” Deborah Altenburg, vice president of research policy and advocacy at the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), said to lawmakers on Tuesday in Alexandria.
Altenburg said every member institution of APLU has had at least one grant canceled or delayed and “there’s really no clarity at this point or way to gauge what the full cost of those cuts will be.”
The funding institutions receive for their facilities and administrative costs could also be capped under the changes, which would be “devastating” to the university-based research structure, since it’s the “major driver for our U.S. economy,” she said.
The changes for research institutions come as lawmakers prepare for the wider impacts on Virginia’s federal workforce and funding reductions, following executive actions taken by President Donald Trump‘s administration since taking office in January to cut what they have called “wasteful” government spending.
So far, the number of available private-sector jobs has declined, and contracts have been canceled in Northern Virginia, InsideNOVA reports. The state’s community colleges have also ended DEI admission policies, in light of federal mandates snuffing out diversity, equity and inclusion practices, while the Trump administration has threatened to yank federal funding from schools that don’t end race-based admissions policies.
Va. community colleges end diversity, equity and inclusion practices

In response to the federal workforce and funding reductions, the Virginia House of Delegates, directed by House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, developed a committee to focus solely on how the changes affect Virginians.
The committee is responsible for collecting data on the potential scope of workforce and funding cuts, and analyzing the likely impacts of the cuts on Virginia’s economy and budget should they be partially or fully realized, according to the speaker’s letter.

The committee is responsible for inviting stakeholders across a wide range of interests to provide their perspectives and recommend solutions to the challenges.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, the committee chair, said the Trump administration’s decisions will have “significant, if not profound” impacts on Virginia, including on its workforce, the state budget and other key areas.
“The federal cuts are going to have a ripple effect on Virginia’s economy and so we need to be prepared to pivot and fill in that gap before it creates budget shortfalls,” Bulova said.
 House committee digs into federal cuts’ impact on Virginia

The committee met in February to plan four meetings in different parts of the state for lawmakers to gather insights from experts on federal workforce and economic impacts statewide and regionally. The first meeting was held Tuesday, at Virginia Tech’s Innovation Campus in Alexandria.
According to the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, whose representatives presented at the meeting, Virginia has more federal workers than nearly every other state, and Virginia’s federal workforce is highly educated and concentrated on national security. 
The committee also learned about the federal budget process, and the tools the president’s team is using to excise what they deem to be excessive programming, funding and resources. 
Rescissions and reprogramming are the Trump Administration’s preferred tools to reduce spending — with Congress support — before invoking the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), according to representatives from Crossroads Strategies during Tuesday’s presentation.
The ICA allows temporary deferral of funds, but not cancellation without Congressional approval.
 Uncertainty for research institutions

Lawmakers suggested that Virginia’s research institutions may soon have to begin assessing their grant programs, if more are canceled or even lost. This comes as APLU, the American Council on Education and Association of American Universities and others are fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to cut funds for research projects.
The committee feared institutions may have to raise tuition or limit research to address the potential losses.
“Universities are really in uncharted waters, and each institution will need to make decisions based on their institutions’ resources and risk tolerances,” Altenburg said.

Some of the top federal funding recipients in the commonwealth include the University of Virginia, which received $354.7 million in 2023, followed by Virginia Tech with $28.21 million. 
In 2023, Virginia State University also received $7.2 million and $3.5 million to James Madison University. All these institutions are members of APLU. 
Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, said education is at the “core” of Virginia’s success when developing “highly educated and skilled” federal workers.
“If there’s going to be any type of reductions, it’s going to … crumble the very core of our footprint here in Virginia,” Anthony cautioned.
Altenburg, whose association aims to enhance student success and workforce readiness, advance groundbreaking scientific research, and strengthen economic and community engagement, showed how money from the government supports critical aspects of higher education in the state.
Federal funding, now in jeopardy, has supported a combination of direct expenditures and facilities’ administrative costs, Altenburg relayed. Some of the research and development costs include salaries, stipends and equipment.
Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William, who is the chair of the House Education subcommittee on higher education, attended Tuesday’s committee meeting and said afterwards “it is crucial for policymakers to fully understand the consequences these cuts may have on both the accessibility and functionality of these institutions. The insights of educators and administrators are vital in ensuring these challenges are addressed effectively.” 
 NOVA Community College support

Amid the troubling prospects from federal reductions, the committee also received good news that it hopes to build on across the commonwealth. 
On Tuesday, Northern Virginia Community College shared that it recently committed $1 million in scholarship aid to allow eligible unemployed federal workers and contractors to enroll in one of 14 courses at no charge, and to access NOVA-sponsored online workshops on resume-writing and job search techniques.
The initiative, referred to as NOVAnext Partnership, is expected to provide scholarships to 1,000 participants.
Anne Kress, president of Northern Virginia Community College, said it’s a step towards stemming federal workers’ lost jobs statewide.
“This is not the solution. It is part of a solution,” said Kress.
Some of the courses included in the initiative focus on providing certifications in IT specialties, program management and human resources. Other instructional opportunities include online entrepreneurship and a new Generative Artificial Intelligence course.
Eligible students must be federal and contract workers who have been laid off on or after Jan. 24, 2025 and reside within the Northern Virginia service area. The NOVA community college system said participants can also enroll in other courses at a regular tuition rate and may qualify for additional state financial aid.
Kress said in two weeks, the community college system has approved 204 applications. Most of the applications are from those impacted by the cuts at USAID.
Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, applauded the initiative.

“This is exciting, and I would also say it’s amazing to me how, in large part, it mirrors what the state of Virginia has already developed and been doing,” Wilt said, referencing Virginia Has Jobs, the state portal touted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin as a solution for laid-off federal workers. 
“It’s great opportunity for us,” Wilt said. “I know we’ve all been concerned about our citizens that have lost jobs and maybe potentially could be coming down the road, but we’ve got good solutions.”

Johnson earned the Most Valuable Player award with a stat line of 21 points, four rebounds and two steals in her team’s 71-59 victory. She shot an impressive 9 for 13 from the field. Cheryl Miller, who’s basketball royalty, coached her team.
The game in Florida featured stars from major programs including the Southeastern, Atlantic Coast and Big 10 conferences. It aired live on ESPN2, and Johnson received a chain basketball hoop as part of her award.
“The opportunity was given to us to showcase our talent to see what we can do on and off the court,” Johnson told All-Star game organizers after her MVP performance. “I am just so grateful for this. So grateful.”
She’s a Philadelphia native, but she has several ties to the commonwealth. Johnson started high school in Hampton and played in the well-known Boo Williams Summer League. In what’s become common in the current college landscape, she previously attended Rutgers and North Carolina State before coming to mid-major NSU in the 2023-24 academic year.
The 5-foot-5 graduate student was named Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference player of the year this season, and she led her team to the NCAA tournament. She also excelled in the classroom, landing on the conference’s All-Academic Team.
A published report says only seven HBCU players have been drafted by the WNBA since its inaugural season in 1997. I attribute that to the high-level competition in the major conferences, as well as the size and skills of those players. (NSU Assistant Director of Sports Communications Noah Schlekeway told me just 14 Spartans have gone on to play in the NBA.)
Johnson, though, has a legitimate shot at becoming the eighth selected from an HBCU at the April 14 draft. At the very least, she’s expanded her opportunities with leagues overseas.
Her televised MVP performance on Saturday ensured it, while also lifting up NSU and other HBCUs in the process.

Two proposals before the Legislature seek to update state law to better identify the children at risk of harm and prevent families from interacting with the child welfare system due to their financial situation. 
“The ambiguous definition of neglect also subjects parents and caregivers to an investigation that mandates surveillance and oversight merely for being poor,” said Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) when introducing his proposal to update the state’s definition of abuse and neglect. 
Maine’s definition of neglect is ‘easy to conflate with poverty’

Hickman’s bill (LD 891) and legislation from Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), LD 1406, both seek to decouple poverty with the state’s definition of abuse and neglect by clarifying that a child’s needs are willfully withheld. The idea is supported by former foster parents, child welfare advocates and legal organizations; however, some preferred LD 891 because they felt the proposed changes went further to address the issue. 
Attorneys who work with families involved with the child welfare system also generally favored Hickman’s bill, sharing stories with the Health and Human Services Committee on Tuesday about cases they worked on that could have been avoided if the proposed changes had been in place. 
The current law allows for families to be flagged for children missing medical appointments because parents don’t have reliable transportation or children having dirty or ill-fitting clothing, said Molly Owens, parents counsel division chief for the Maine Commission for Public Defense Services. 
“These are cases where there’s no physical or sexual abuse, and children aren’t mistreated or willfully neglected,” Owens said. “Rather, the family is struggling to really and reliably provide basic necessities.”










Our current law places little value on a loving, low-income parent.


– Molly Owens, Maine Commission for Public Defense Services


She added that “our current law places little value on a loving, low-income parent.”
Equating poverty to parental neglect is not unique to Maine. In July 2024, the Biden administration released guidance that states should update their definitions of abuse and neglect to differentiate between a financial inability to provide adequate housing or other material needs. 
Meyer said her bill was born out of advisory groups that included state agencies, child welfare advocates and other entities dedicated to keeping Maine children safe who looked into the state’s mandated reporting laws and how they affect families. The language in her proposal is modeled after the language Kentucky used to update its definition. 
Even if the claims are unsubstantiated, Meyer said it is still traumatic for families to be reported to child protective services. Additionally, having to weed through reports of parents who can’t financially provide certain needs can mean less time for caseworkers to address situations where children face serious harm. 
“If we continue to punish poverty, we will continue to have an overburdened system,” Owens said, speaking in favor of LD 891 and neither for nor against LD 1406. 
Bobbi Johnson, the director of the Office of Child and Family Services, testified in support  of Meyer’s bill, saying it is part of a broader effort to support families in need rather than getting them tangled up in the system. However, she said the child welfare agency is opposed to LD 891 because it inserts certain language that isn’t currently defined in statute and would limit the agency’s ability to intervene in certain accidental situations, even if they are connected to a larger concern about the child’s care. 
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, which also favored LD 1406 due to the input of the broad stakeholder group, encouraged committee members to consider the passion heard for both pieces of legislation.

The two have dealt with extensive challenges caring for their daughter, and the Office of the Child Advocate has been one of the few agencies able to help. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)In January, Julie and her husband, Richard, from southeastern New Hampshire, were being told two seemingly contradictory things: They needed to pick up their daughter, who has struggled with severe behavioral problems due to her reactive attachment disorder, from her treatment program at state-owned Hampstead Hospital or else face child abandonment charges. At the same time, they were being investigated for child abuse.
“I’m like, ‘Wait, wait, wait … let me understand,” Julie recounted. “You are investigating us for abusing this girl because you believe that we’re locking her in her closet and refusing her food, and you’re also telling us, if we do not pick her up from Hampstead Hospital, that we are going to face child abandonment and neglect charges?’ And she said, ‘Right.’”
The situation, which caused anxiety and stress for the parents, was part of a long series of challenges they faced raising their daughter. But it was during this incident that they were connected with the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate. The watchdog agency was established by the state Legislature in 2018 to oversee the state’s child welfare, juvenile justice, and care systems, and advocate for the best interests of children. Julie and Richard said it was among the only entities able to help them do right by their daughter. Now, the Office of the Child Advocate is one of the agencies on the chopping block as Republicans seek to shrink the state budget.
‘An altered state’
Julie and Richard adopted their daughter in 2022 soon after moving to New Hampshire. (The Bulletin is not naming the daughter or using the family’s last name to protect her privacy.) 
“My husband and I got married a little bit later in life,” Julie said. “We were in our late 40s when we met, and we were both very, very eager to start a family through adoption.”
In New Hampshire, they began the foster-to-adopt process.
“Really quickly after we got approved, I would say, within a couple of weeks, we got a phone call that there was a little girl who needed emergency respite placement,” Julie said. “There was an incident at her foster home, and so she spent a weekend with us, and it was a wonderful weekend.”
A couple days later they were told she’d need an adoptive home soon, and they didn’t hesitate.
“Less than a week after meeting her, she permanently moved in with us,” Julie continued. “And there was just a series of things that occurred that really, really highlighted to us how much need there is to better fund agencies in the state that are taking care of the state’s most vulnerable children.”
Their new daughter, who was 8 at the time of adoption, had an extensive history of abuse and neglect from her biological family, they said. The couple was horrified by documents they received outlining what the girl had experienced.
“Every abuse you could think of, she suffered at her bio family,” Richard said.
Their daughter was soon diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, a rare condition that predominately affects children in the foster system. It occurs when a young child doesn’t establish healthy attachments with parents or caregivers, and becomes unable to do so in the future. It can lead to severe behavioral challenges.
For Julie and Richard’s daughter, the condition caused her to become violent. Once the adoption was finalized, their daughter lost access to the therapy and supports she was receiving in the foster system. This now fell all upon Julie and Richard, who promptly began seeking similar supports, but struggled navigating several complex systems with little guidance from the state.
Their daughter would often have violent episodes, and endanger herself and others as a symptom of her disorder, they explained. They and others, such as school counselors, had to call 911 several times, and their daughter has had to stay in hospitals throughout the state, including in Portsmouth, Concord, and Dover. There were incidents with knives, screwdrivers, and pills; sometimes, they said, she’d do thousands of dollars of property damage.
“It got to a point where we had to lock up all our knives and silverware and anything that she could use as a weapon,” Richard said. “Because when she would get into these states, anything and everything she could find, she would use as a weapon.”
Julie emphasized how this is a result of her condition.
“We’ve had brain scans done now with neurofeedback,” Julie said. “And we saw clearly before and after scans where she did not, at that time, have any physiological capability to control her impulses. She was in an altered state, and that’s why, you know, she would grab anything she could, to punch, to hit, to kick, to break things.”
Over the years, they’ve seen a number of therapists and utilized several programs, including in Vermont, Missouri, and Massachusetts.
‘How do we take her home?’
“Aside from, you know, a few individuals that we’ve worked with, we really believe there are too many broken systems in New Hampshire for the children who are most vulnerable,” Julie said. “And the most egregious experience in the state we had is with Hampstead Hospital.”
After an emergency department visit, Julie and Richard’s daughter was transferred to Hampstead Hospital, New Hampshire’s only acute psychiatric hospital and residential treatment facility for youth and young adults, in 2023. They said that after she was at Hampstead for 10 days, they received a call saying she needed to be picked up.
“My response was, ‘Wait, wait, wait, she is incapable of spending any time in person with me without punching and kicking and hitting,’” Julie explained. “‘How do we take her home? We’re going to have to call 911, again.’ And they’re like, ‘Yeah, exactly. That’s how the state works, but you have to come pick her up.’”
They retrieved their daughter, and as they expected, they called 911 because she got violent. They continued trying to work with their daughter through her struggles, but in December 2024, she was getting violent with others and threatening self harm, so she was admitted to an emergency room at Portsmouth Hospital, which eventually referred her to Hampstead Hospital again.
A few weeks later, in January 2025, Hampstead Hospital again demanded they bring their daughter home, this time threatening them with child abandonment charges. They refused to have a care team meeting. Julie said they were “screaming” at her “like a banshee.” Meanwhile, they learned they were being investigated by the state for child abuse — it’s common for children with reactive attachment disorder to falsely accuse parents of abuse or neglect, according to the organization RAD Advocates. Additionally, there was no safety plan to ensure a repeat incident didn’t occur, and they were providing no further support at home. Julie and Richard said they were certain if they brought their daughter home, they’d be forced to call 911 again.
“If we were really abusing our daughter, why would you want the child going home?” Richard said.
Audra Burns, media relations director for Dartmouth Health, which runs Hampstead Hospital through a contract with the state, said in a statement, “We cannot comment on individual patient matters. Hampstead Hospital and Residential Treatment Facility cares for very complex pediatric behavioral health needs and has robust risk assessments and discharge planning to ensure patients are cared for when and where will be most beneficial.” (In February, Dartmouth Health took over the hospital entirely; prior to that, it was contracted to assist with a portion of the operations.)
Jake Leon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, (Hampstead Hospital is owned by the state) said in a statement: “The Department is unable to comment on the specifics of this case due to patient confidentiality laws. The teams at Hampstead Hospital and Dartmouth Health work with DCYF to determine the best long-term treatment path when it is time for a patient to be discharged from a residential setting, factoring in both patient and community safety. The State’s goal is to reduce time spent in residential treatment where appropriate and help youth achieve long-term stability with family and community-based solutions supported by the Behavioral Health System of Care.”
‘Like a 180’
After their daughter’s most recent stay at Hampstead Hospital, Julie and Richard consulted a representative from a program called Fast Forward, who suggested they reach out to the Office of the Child Advocate. Throughout this yearslong process, Julie and Richard have felt mostly alone with little guidance on how to navigate this system and what to do when they believe the system isn’t doing right by their daughter. They’d gotten conflicting advice from different therapists and providers. However, the Office of the Child Advocate was one of a few exceptions to that (along with Fast Forward), they said.
“We were being asked to do something where we felt there were going to be extraordinary safety concerns for our daughter,” Julie said. “And there was no empathy or compassion or planning or concern for our daughter’s safety, until the Office of the Child Advocate got involved.”
Jason Taylor, an assistant child advocate on the team, told them to “call their bluff,” Julie recounted.
“He’s like, ‘Given your story, there’s no judge in this state that is going to file charges against you,’” she said. “‘You have done more than any family would ever be capable of doing, let alone willing. And Hampstead Hospital does this all the time.’”
Taylor helped them keep their daughter in Hampstead Hospital, which wanted to discharge her, until a bed opened up at a facility in Massachusetts. And the couple recruited over a dozen loved ones to write character references and email them to the state with Taylor copied. This got the investigation into them closed, unsubstantiated.
“On Monday morning, I still remember,” Julie said. “It was 10 o’clock. I was in the car. I got a call from (the state), and she’s like, ‘I think there’s been some confusion, and I just want to clear some things up. We don’t believe there’s any abuse going on in your home, and we don’t want to file child abandonment charges.’”
 “When the Office of Child Advocate got involved, it was like a 180,” Richard added.
Julie said the difference between the Massachusetts facility and previous ones they’d been at, particularly in Missouri, was “night and day.”
The two said complex situations like theirs are difficult to navigate without an entity designed to advocate on behalf of the child. They’ve heard that many others have had issues at Hampstead Hospital specifically. They also acknowledged that it must be even more difficult for families who don’t have the financial resources they have. Richard said they’d spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on treatment programs, therapies, and other supports in addition to state-funded programs, and Julie was able to quit her job to focus on their daughter’s treatments.
They wonder how different their story would be if they’d known about the Office of the Child Advocate sooner or how much money the state would’ve saved if it had invested even more in it and similar programs meant to catch issues on the front end before they grow into more costly and devastating tragedies.
‘We need the money’
Julie and Richard’s interactions with the Office of the Child Advocate came a few months before Republicans in the New Hampshire House of Representatives proposed eliminating the office as a cost-cutting measure.
The Legislature is in the middle of the lengthy state budgeting process during a difficult fiscal year. After Gov. Kelly Ayotte released her two-year budget proposal in February, the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee decided her revenue projections, which predicted a quick economic turnaround after years of lagging business tax revenues, were too optimistic, and the House Finance Committee began proposing funding cuts.
In March, Republicans on House Finance Division I, one of three legislative subcommittees working on the budget, identified the Office of the Child Advocate and several other agencies as areas to cut. That committee voted 5-4, along party lines, to recommend the full House eliminate the Office of the Child Advocate, fire its staff, and repeal the statutes that created it.
Doing so would save the state about $2 million over two years. The House was looking to trim nearly $800 million to match the governor’s budget to their projections.
Rep. Kenneth Weyler, chairman of the House Finance Committee, and Rep. Dan McGuire, chairman of House Finance Division I, did not respond to requests for comment or an interview from the Bulletin. However, at the March work session where they voted to recommend elimination, McGuire said the office — as well as the Commission on Aging, and the Housing Appeals Board, which they also voted to eliminate — are “sort of nice-to-haves, but they’re not necessary.” 
“We need the money,” he continued. “I don’t know how to put it any blunter.”
On Thursday, the full House is set to vote on the budget. If they vote in favor of the budget without an amendment restoring the Office of the Child Advocate, the Senate will consider it. The Senate will have the ability to restore the Office of the Child Advocate or keep it out of the budget. Once they approve a budget and reconcile it with the House if needed, it will go to the governor, who will get the final sign-off.
The House budget proposal being considered Thursday would also eliminate the Office of Early Childhood Education, the State Council on the Arts, the Human Rights Commission, the state’s right-to-know ombudsman, the Housing Appeals Board, and the Governor’s Scholarship Fund.
It would also cut down on state staffing, eliminating 190 positions from the Department of Corrections; 34 in the Liquor Commission; 27 from the Department of Education; 14 in the Department of Business and Economic Affairs; eight in the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources; eight in the Department of Safety; five in the Secretary of State’s Office; and three in the Insurance Department.
The budget also includes cuts of roughly $50 million to the University System of New Hampshire, $46 million to the Department of Health and Human Services, $14.7 million to the Department of Justice, $10 million to the Department of Information Technology, $8.7 million to the New Hampshire Retirement System, $7.9 million to the judicial branch, $6 million to the Department of Environmental Services, $1 million to the legislative branch, $600,000 to the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, and $100,000 to the governor’s office.
At the same time, the House proposal seeks to expand the state’s voucher-like education freedom accounts program, making it universal by 2026-2027 school year, for an estimated cost of $91 million over two years.
‘Let’s not cut things that protect the children’
Cassandra Sanchez, the New Hampshire child advocate and head of the office, said Julie and Richard’s story is not entirely uncommon. Sanchez and Taylor aren’t allowed to discuss specific cases under department policy, but Sanchez spoke generally about this type of situation, which she said is “one we see far too often at the office.”

“We have received so many of those calls from families — a large number of them adoptive families, others biological families — having attempted to utilize everything available to them in the system, and really at a loss for what to do, because they don’t feel they can keep their child safe,” Sanchez said. “We have become highly involved in those cases, understanding the importance of getting children swiftly into the appropriate level of care, especially if they’re in the acute need for Hampstead Hospital.”
She said they’ve seen numerous issues at Hampstead Hospital, which she said has had staffing issues and has been unable to utilize all their beds. She said her office spends a significant amount of time at Hampstead Hospital, monitoring the services and speaking with children there.
Meanwhile, Julie and Richard hope others see the value in the child advocate.
“If there’s a subset of people who do not have a voice, do not have a mechanism for advocating for themselves, it’s children, right?” she said. “So that should be the one place where, no matter what your political leaning is, you can get around this. Like, let’s not cut things that protect the children who don’t have a voice, that can’t help themselves, right?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/julierichard-1024x523.jpg,,,2025-04-09 06:01:36.706801

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)For a week, global financial markets have plunged and swung wildly as a result of President Donald Trump’s huge tariffs. Already, auto-sector layoffs have started at a company with a big Ohio presence. 
One Republican Ohio U.S. Senator seems to have embraced the tariffs. The other says he’s talking to concerned parties about them. One candidate for the GOP governor nomination in 2026 also embraced the tariffs, while a Democratic candidate condemned them. The others who are either in the Republican field or potentially so didn’t comment.
The global financial markets on Tuesday were regaining some of their value after Chinese companies started buying stocks to stabilize them. But already, Trump’s 25% tariff on vehicles had slowed imports and temporarily shut down some factories, the New York Times reported.
Stellantis, the Netherlands-based company that owns Dodge, Chrysler, and Jeep, laid off 900 people temporarily at powertrain and stamping plants in Michigan and Indiana. If a trade war persists, the company’s roughly 2,600 union workers at its Jeep plant in Toledo could also eventually be affected.

In addition, the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, are expected to raise consumer prices by 2.3%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Since Trump began announcing the tariffs last week, he’s been accused of serious mathematical bungling. 
Economists at the conservative American Enterprise Institute said that the tariffs themselves make no sense. But even if they did, they said, the formula on which they’re based contains a math error that inflates the tariffs fourfold.
Meanwhile, all the volatility created by the tariffs has created uncertainty that can make business planning all but impossible, Nobel Prize-winning columnist Paul Krugman told the New York Times.
Even so, Trump isn’t backing down, and he’s not admitting any mistakes. That has billionaires who supported Trump’s election pleading with officials in his administration to persuade him to change course.
Given the implications for the Ohio economy, one might think the state’s leaders would weigh in. But after queries were made Monday of the sitting governor, four likely candidates to run for that office in 2026 and the state’s two U.S. senators, only three responded.
The officials were asked whether they supported the Trump tariffs and what they would say to Ohioans who’ve seen their retirement accounts depleted as the markets plunged. 
Trump is selling the import taxes as painful medicine to bring back manufacturing. The current and would-be Ohio officials were also asked how long people should have to suffer before that happens.
One response came from the campaign of pharmaceutical entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who is seeking the 2026 GOP nomination to be governor. Ramaswamy left a lead position with Elon Musk’s government-slashing “Department of Government Efficiency” to mount his campaign.
“President Trump endorsed Vivek because he’s laser-focused on an America First, Ohio First agenda, including sparking a manufacturing boom by cutting red tape, building a skilled workforce, and unleashing the energy dominance needed to power Ohio’s economic revival,” Ramaswamy campaign manager Jonathan Ewing said in an email. “For decades, Ohio workers have been hit hard by America’s manufacturing exodus, and it’s time to hit back. Vivek is focused on advancing bold, no-nonsense solutions to restore opportunity for all hardworking Ohioans and make our state an economic powerhouse once again.”
Nervous senators from both parties press Trump trade rep on tariffs as high as 104%

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, who is also seeking the GOP nomination, didn’t respond. 
Governor’s Office Press Secretary Dan Tierney was asked where Gov. Mike DeWine stood on Trump’s tariffs. He was also asked for a press contact for newly appointed Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, so the same questions could be put to that person. Tierney didn’t respond. 
DeWine appointed Tressel to fill the lieutenant governor’s spot after appointing former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by J.D. Vance when he became vice president. Tressel hasn’t announced a candidacy for governor, but as a former football coach of a national-championship Ohio State Buckeye team, there has been speculation that he has the popularity to run.
Dr. Amy Acton, a Columbus-area physician who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, said Trump was needlessly making life harder for average Ohioans.
“Our leaders should be solving problems not creating them,” she said in an email. “Ohioans across the state who are struggling with the cost of living shouldn’t have to worry about our President starting reckless trade wars and causing chaos with tariffs that raise costs and make our lives even harder. We need a real plan to lower costs and raise wages that starts with listening to local communities — not simply picking fights to fake toughness.
Husted’s office commented on tariffs, but it didn’t say whether he supported Trump’s.
“Ohio is a strong Made-in-America state, and the senator is talking with and listening to Ohio job creators and workers all the time about what policies, including tariffs and tariff relief, they may need in order to get the inputs required to produce goods here at home,” Deputy Chief of Staff Jess Andrews said in an email. “He was on the ground alongside Ohio workers recently doing just that, and he is sharing these priorities with the administration directly.”
Ohio’s other new Republican senator, Bernie Moreno, didn’t respond to questions for this story, but he appears to be embracing the Trump tariffs on social media.
“Career politicians like (former Vice President Mike Pence) are part of the problem, they did nothing for decades while our industrial sector was gutted,” he said on X the day the tariffs were implemented. “President Trump is finally reversing their failed policies and fighting back for American workers. That’s exactly what we saw today.”

As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”



North Carolina impacts will likely be problematic
A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services told NC Newsline on Tuesday that while the agency is doing its best to monitor and respond to the measles threat and doesn’t yet know the full impact of federal cuts, “We do know these cuts will significantly reduce our ability to quickly respond to potential measles cases and outbreaks.”
Among the known impacts identified by the spokesperson:

Lost funding for surge staff who are trained to assist with outbreak investigations and other public health responses, including measles response.
Loss of temporary and contracted staff who support DHHS’s ability to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats.
Loss of corrections response team, which helped to provide hands on consultations to jails and state corrections.
Reduced ability to rapidly identify and respond to measles and other infectious disease cases in hospitals.
Potential delays in receiving and responding to reports of positive test results for measles.

Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
Public debate
Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.











It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician



From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
Making the connection
Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

___________________
Workers at one of the nation’s largest baby formula plants say the Abbott Laboratories facility is engaging in unsanitary practices similar to those that led it to temporarily shut down just three years ago, sparking a nationwide formula shortage.

Current and former employees told ProPublica that they have seen the plant in Sturgis, Michigan, take shortcuts when cleaning manufacturing equipment and testing for microbes. The employees said leaks in the factory are sometimes not fixed, a dangerous problem that can promote bacterial growth. They also said workers at the facility do not always take required swabs to check for pathogens while performing maintenance during production. Supervisors have urged workers to increase production and have retaliated against workers who complained about problems, the employees said.
One worker complained to the Food and Drug Administration in February, saying the plant has experienced “persistent leaks” and “unaddressed contamination issues,” according to correspondence between the worker and the agency viewed by ProPublica. Water and chemicals have pooled on the floor, the worker said. In one spot, white sweetener oozed from a pipe and formed a pile like a stalagmite on top of a tank used for blending, the employee said.
The complaints come as the Trump administration is dismantling wide swaths of the federal government — including conducting mass layoffs at the FDA — and filling some key regulatory positions with industry-friendly voices. The new head of the FDA division that oversees baby formula is a corporate lawyer who previously defended Abbott against a lawsuit.
The workers ProPublica spoke to said they did not want to be named because they feared repercussions from Abbott management, but they felt compelled to speak up out of concern that a baby who drank formula made at the plant would fall ill.
“I can’t have this on my conscience,” one of the workers said.
Abbott called workers’ assertions “untrue or misleading,” denied their claims about retaliation and said the company “stands behind the quality and safety of all our products including those made at Sturgis.” In a statement, a spokesperson said that since 2022, the company had increased plant staff by 300 people, spent $60 million on upgrades and stationed multiple food-safety consultants there on weekdays. The company said the plant often takes more than 10,000 environmental swabs across the facility in a month to check for microbes.
“We believe Sturgis is the most inspected, tested, and swabbed infant formula manufacturing facility in the U.S., and likely in the world,” the statement said.
That said, Abbott conceded that the plant acted “outside of our quality process” in one incident from last May.
Workers told ProPublica that, instead of retrieving a portable pump, an employee used a piece of cardboard from a trash bin to funnel coconut oil, a formula ingredient, into a tank during production of the company’s Pure Bliss by Similac Organic brand. Abbott said the cardboard “was reactively used to prevent spilling onto the floor.” The company denied that there was a trash receptacle in the area and said plant practice was for cardboard to be stacked on a pallet before being recycled.
Food-safety laws require companies to use clean tools to transfer ingredients, not a makeshift implement like cardboard, said Patrick Stone, a former FDA inspector who works as a consultant.
“No one would think that’s a proper use,” he said. “It’s not something that’s been cleaned and verified it’s clear of contamination.”
Abbott, however, downplayed the significance of the incident, saying it occurred early in the manufacturing process, before pasteurization, and the product underwent “enhanced testing” that came back negative for microbes.
“We acknowledge that this is outside of our quality process, and this has been addressed,” Abbott’s statement said. The company said the plant had a discussion with the employee reiterating the proper procedure.
Employees complained about the incident at the time and some hoped the plant had destroyed the formula. But a few weeks later, they received an email, which ProPublica viewed, that said the plant had released all batches “not just on time, but early.” It congratulated workers for an “amazing milestone and achievement for Sturgis.”
Abbott said there have been no medical complaints related to the lot. The brand is advertised as suitable for newborns.
In another incident in February, an employee said that the company had signed off on the use of an amino acid that was 10 months past its manufacturer’s “best by” date. A photo of the label viewed by ProPublica showed a best by date of April 2024. The law requires that ingredients in formula not expire before the formula as a whole, Stone said.
Abbott said that the powder’s expiration date had been “extended,” which it said regulations permit in some cases, after the company used third-party testing to confirm its nutrient levels.
But the worker said the amino acid powder was “chunky” and employees refused to add it to a formula mixture. It had been manufactured in October 2023.
Abbott told ProPublica that two containers of amino acid mix were, in fact, placed on hold due to “crustiness” and later destroyed. “When we find products that don’t meet all specifications, we dispose of them,” the company said.
Some of the workers said they’ve felt pressure not to disrupt the manufacturing process. At one meeting in February, a worker said a senior manager told employees the plant needed to improve its profit margins by either increasing production or reducing the amount of formula it was discarding as unusable.
Abbott disputed the idea that it is cutting corners to make more formula.
“Any assertion that quality is being sacrificed at the expense of volume and profit is patently untrue,” it said. The company said that in 2024, Abbott made 41% less formula at Sturgis than it had in 2021, the year before the shutdown.
For its part, the FDA did not respond to questions about whether an inspection or investigation is taking place at the Sturgis plant in response to the complaint it received. The agency said it generally does not comment on “potential or ongoing inspections or investigations.”
In a statement, the FDA said that it “takes reports related to infant formula seriously and follows up as appropriate.”
The case could prove to be a major test for President Donald Trump’s second administration, which just last month announced an effort to “ensure the ongoing quality, safety, nutritional adequacy, and resilience of the domestic infant formula supply.” Dubbed Operation Stork Speed, it promised to increase ingredient testing and communicate regularly with consumers and the industry “as significant developments occur to ensure transparency, including information regarding nutrients and health outcomes.”
 “Egregiously Unsanitary” Conditions

The Abbott employees’ concerns come three years after the company voluntarily recalled several formula brands, including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare, and temporarily halted production at Sturgis amid reports of unsanitary conditions and infant deaths.
A former plant employee in 2021 had told the FDA that the plant was using lax cleaning practices, falsifying records and releasing untested infant formula to the public. FDA inspectors found leaking equipment valves, standing water and a type of bacteria at the plant called Cronobacter sakazakii, which is common but can be deadly for young babies. Company documents showed the manufacturer had even discovered the bacteria in its finished formula in 2019 and 2020, the report said. Food-safety laws require companies to test samples of their formula to check the nutrient content and look for harmful microorganisms.
Those inspection findings were “shocking,” a former FDA chief said later. He called the plant “egregiously unsanitary.”
Initial reports said several infants were hospitalized and two died from an illness caused by the Cronobacter bacteria after drinking formula made at the Sturgis plant, according to an inspector general’s report. Between December 2021 and June 2022, it said the FDA received a total of 16 consumer complaints involving infant deaths and Sturgis facility products.
The report said the FDA did not directly link drinking formula from the plant to any of the infants’ illnesses or deaths. Abbott said no unopened Abbott formula has ever tested positive for Cronobacter.
Still, in May of 2022, Abbott signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice and the FDA and committed to following improved procedures at the facility. The decree is still in effect. It says the company can be fined up to $30,000 a day for violations, with a maximum of $5 million in a year.
The plant’s nearly four-month-long shutdown in 2022 sparked a nationwide formula shortage, which was worsened by COVID-19-related supply-chain issues. Store shelves emptied of formula, leaving parents desperate. Some babies developed symptoms such as spitting up and diarrhea after being forced to switch brands, researchers found. Nearly half of parents in one survey of primarily low-income families said they’d resorted to at least one unsafe feeding practice, such as watering down formula.
Abbott said it disagreed “vehemently” with the FDA chief’s comments on the Sturgis plant being unsanitary, and it said the former employee who filed the 2021 complaint with the agency was dismissed for “serious violations” of its food-safety policies. Abbott said the employee’s specific claims were not supported by the FDA. “It’s time to stop giving credence and fame to individuals with questionable agendas” that have led to “unnecessary” formula shortages, Abbott said.
 New Complaints Arise as FDA Is Cut

It’s unclear how the Trump administration, with its reduced federal workforce, will respond to the newest complaints. The administration recently eliminated 3,500 FDA jobs as part of extensive cuts in federal health workers’ ranks. While officials said the reductions will not impact inspectors, the agency did not answer a question about whether any of the employees being let go are involved in inspection or enforcement for the Sturgis facility.
The White House also recently installed a corporate lawyer in a top FDA post, putting him in charge of the agency’s regulation of formula. Kyle Diamantas, acting deputy commissioner for human foods, previously defended Abbott against a lawsuit in which families alleged the company failed to warn them about a deadly bowel condition that premature babies who are fed formula have a greater risk of developing. Abbott has appealed a verdict in which it was ordered to pay $495 million.
Meanwhile, at the Department of Agriculture, officials disbanded an advisory committee that had been studying the threat of Cronobacter contamination in powdered formula. The USDA said at the time that it did so to comply with an executive order seeking to reduce bureaucracy but it remained committed to food safety. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a Trump presidency had listed as one of its goals reevaluating “excessive regulation” of infant formula.
Families using formula aren’t being protected if the FDA is acting like a partner to companies like Abbott instead of overseeing them, said Jennifer Pomeranz, a professor and expert in public health and food policy at New York University who has served as a witness for plaintiffs suing Abbott over the bowel condition. She called Diamantas’ appointment the “perfect example of regulatory capture.”
In its statement to ProPublica, the FDA said it is “committed to enhancing regulatory oversight of all infant formula manufacturers to help ensure that the industry is producing infant formula under the safest conditions possible.”
The Sturgis plant is a major supplier of formula in the United States and had been producing about 20% of the nation’s formula when it shut down in 2022. Abbott provides formula to more than half of babies in the government-backed nutrition-assistance program, called WIC, that subsidizes families’ formula purchases. The company has contracts to be the sole source of formula for WIC recipients in 36 states and Washington, D.C., as of August of last year.
 “If You Have Leaks, Forget About It”

Since the 2022 consent decree, FDA records show it has completed 10 inspections, including a multiweek review that was underway when employees said the cardboard incident took place. (The company says that according to its records, it has been inspected by FDA 12 times in that period.) No action was required in response to most of those visits, according to a database that tracks FDA inspections.
But for one inspection that ended in December 2022, the FDA issued a citation that noted concerns related to contamination prevention, worker hygiene and the handling of consumer complaints, documents say.
A report from that inspection — completed just seven months after Abbott signed the consent decree — said the agency found problems similar to those that had shut down the plant.
The report noted, among other things, six instances of employees failing to collect required swabs to test for bacterial contamination after cleaning up a leak. It also said inspectors found “apparent insects and dust like debris” near formula-making equipment. “You did not establish a system of process controls covering all stages of processing that was designed to ensure that infant formula does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or in the processing environment,” the report said.
Stone, the former FDA inspector who is now a consultant, said the citation is significant. “FDA should have really hammered on them harder,” he said, “but they’re weak and they’re scared.”
Without taking those swabs and testing them, the company cannot know if the formula is contaminated, Stone said.
“Unless you’re monitoring your environment, you don’t know what’s in your environment,” he said. “If you have leaks, forget about it. You don’t know what’s in there.”
Abbott said it “has addressed all FDA observations” from 2022. FDA inspectors have raised no major issues since then, the company said.
In 2023, Abbott confirmed the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into conduct at the plant. A spokesperson for the department’s Western District of Michigan did not respond to a request for information about the investigation’s status. Abbott did not respond to a question about the probe but said at the time that it was “cooperating fully.” The Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission were also scrutinizing the company after the problems surfaced in Sturgis. Spokespeople for the SEC and FTC, which released a report on the formula supply disruptions, declined to comment. Abbott did not respond to questions about the investigations.
More recently, some employees who spoke to ProPublica said plant leaders have urged them to speed up production — even though the consent decree aimed to add more safety protocols. “Imagine a 10-page rule book you’re told you have to operate by no matter what,” one said. “No deviations. You’re doing that, and then your boss says, ‘You’re not doing your job fast enough.’”
The workers said some employees have pushed supervisors to follow sanitary procedures more closely and at times refused to run equipment until their concerns about sanitation were met, even as they feared losing their jobs. Abbott is one of the largest and highest-paying employers in the largely rural area near the Indiana border. The plant’s tall white tower, emblazoned with a large green “a,” looms over nearby homes.
An employee said that since the consent decree, he had witnessed leaks of formula, oil, chemicals and water that were not cleaned up, fixed or documented properly. Sometimes, the worker said, supervisors resisted shutting down machinery — always a money-losing proposition — to address a leak. The worker reported seeing a leak that hadn’t been handled correctly more than once a month. “It’s all over,” the employee said.
Photos taken in the plant show equipment whose outer surface was streaked with drips from formula ingredients that had leaked. In one instance, an absorbent mat had been placed on the floor to catch drips. Procedures require the plant to contain leaks, fix equipment and test the area for pathogens, workers say. Leaks can become breeding grounds for bacteria.
Abbott said “in a facility the size of Sturgis, with literally miles of pipes, leaks, drips, and condensation are inevitable.” The plant has a team it deploys quickly to contain leaks, then swab, test and sanitize the area, the company said. The plant aims to limit standing water and sanitize regularly to prevent bacterial growth, Abbott said, and it runs six times the number of Cronobacter tests on finished product samples as required by federal regulations.
“Abbott has a quality policy that we make our products as if they were for our own families,” the company’s statement said. “If quality were not our first priority Abbott would not still be here at 137 years.”
A contractor Abbott hired to improve its processes has raised concerns about the facility not following protocols or procedures in past audits but cited no such problems in the audit completed earlier this year, said Mansour Samadpour, co-founder of IEH Laboratories and Consulting Group. IEH, which began its work after the consent decree, reports back to Abbott and the FDA on what the plant needs to correct. Neither Abbott nor IEH provided a copy of the most recent audit.
Samadpour declined to detail the earlier concerns. He said it was possible an employee could miss a swab, but said there’s no systemic problem. He said he does not have concerns about sanitary practices in the plant.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina state senators approved a bill Tuesday that would spin up a new team in the Republican state auditor’s office to scrutinize state spending and job openings.
Drawing inspiration from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the bill would instruct Auditor Dave Boliek’s office to use A.I. to examine government and recommend any offices or jobs to be cut. Boliek’s new team (with an acronym of “DAVE”) would not have the sole power to cut jobs or spending, and would be dissolved at the end of his term.
Senate Bill 474 passed the chamber on a 29-17, party-line vote. It now heads to the House.
Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson), who sponsored the bill, called it a “comprehensive look at how our state agencies utilize taxpayer money.”
Senate Democrats, as well as the State Employees Association of North Carolina, strongly opposed the bill, arguing that it further hurts the state’s ability to recruit and retain government workers.
“(Republicans) are not going to fill the 20% vacancy rates of positions that North Carolinians need and depend on,” Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Granville) told reporters after the vote. “And they don’t want to take responsibility for their own failures of mismanaging an economy for 14 years.”
Democrats filed a series of unsuccessful amendments Tuesday, including one to require the auditor to also examine school voucher spending and crisis pregnancy centers that receive state dollars.
Boliek, who beat Democrat and former Auditor Jessica Holmes last November, has spoken in support of the bill. He argues it effectively shores up authority his office already has — while adding resources and setting a precise timeline by which to make recommendations to lawmakers.
And he’s said that A.I., which is not currently utilized in an official capacity by state government, would be a useful tool for the new team.
“The fact is, we’ve got to start somewhere in the state of North Carolina using A.I.,” Boliek said during a committee hearing last week. “Because it’s coming. There’s no better place than the state auditor’s office to get started with that.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1385-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 06:01:36.706801

Middletown, for example, saw its grand list shrink “for the first time in recent memory,” because of the car tax valuation changes, its mayor told residents earlier this year. The town is now planning to raise its tax rate.
The loss in the value of the grand list is a fraction of the actual revenue losses towns would see in their budgets, but some local officials still say it’s been a hard hit. State lawmakers and some municipal experts say it’s far more complicated than the car tax changes and that the adjustment to the valuation system will ultimately be good for towns.
State lawmakers in June met in a special session to make technical changes to the state’s system of valuing vehicles for personal property tax purposes. The law originally passed in 2022, but legislators said they needed to make “fixes” to the statute before it went into effect in October 2024.
The 2022 measure, included in the budget bill, mandated that towns use what’s called the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, instead of a system from the National Automobile Dealers Association’s guide to assess the value of cars, so that towns would have a more uniform system.
The change aimed to slightly lower motor vehicle taxes for consumers and to use a new system that’s more predictable and less susceptible to market shifts. It also introduced a 20-year schedule of depreciation as a car ages, so that owners pay a smaller percentage of the suggested retail price as vehicles get older. 
The list began with an 80% valuation for vehicles that are up to a year old, meaning that it drops to 80% of its original value in that year.
The 2024 bill adjusted that schedule so that the list began with an 85% valuation for vehicles that are up to a year old, lessening the impact on municipal budgets, which draw revenue from car taxes.
“[Gov. Ned Lamont] wanted to lower our taxes for people, and part of the idea was to go to the MSRP to make this more predictable, both for the taxpayer and for the towns,” said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon.
But after the law went into effect in July, some towns complained that their budgets had taken too much of a loss. In response, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the legislature decided to change the law again.
In February, lawmakers passed an emergency-certified bill that allowed towns to opt to set the depreciation schedule beginning at 90% of the original value, rather than 85%. Several towns have since decided to use the provision and change their schedules.
Danbury initially stood to lose millions of dollars in its budget, Mayor Roberto Alves said. When the council last week adopted the change, that narrowed to a few hundred thousand dollars.
“What works for one municipality may not work for others. For Danbury, it was nice to have this option,” Alves said. “I’m just happy that the folks in Hartford listened to us.”
Still, organizations that advocate for municipalities said they’re hearing reports that some may see large budget changes. The average grand list loss was at about 14% before the February law passed, said Randy Collins, an associate director at the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
“It was really a difficult number for some towns,” Collins said.
Middletown Mayor Ben Florsheim in January issued a message to residents about the proposed 2025-26 budget that includes an increased mill rate.
“This year, a new change in state law created for Middletown an unprecedented challenge: our grand list shrank,” Florsheim’s message to residents said. “For the first time in recent memory, the total value of taxable property in our city declined — not because homes lost value, or because businesses closed down, but because of a state-mandated change to how we tax cars.”
He said that means property owners will have to shoulder the cost of the change. Middletown adopted the depreciation schedule that began at 90%, which helped, but the town will still need an increased mill rate, he said.
“By forcing towns to undervalue cars, they’ve guaranteed your property taxes must rise to fill the gap,” Florsheim wrote to residents.
Florsheim said in an interview that while he agreed that something needed to be changed about the motor vehicle tax to make it more equitable, this wasn’t the solution.
“I think it was sort of an outgrowth of the general urgency in the legislature to feel like they had done something about this issue and did it in a way that kind of torpedoed grand lists for almost all of their constituent towns,” Florsheim said.
Planning and Development Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Gordon, R-Woodstock, said he hasn’t been supportive of the change from the beginning. He worried that it would put too much burden on towns, he said.
“We were hearing from municipalities about concerns, and now that these changes are in effect, I’m continuing to hear from my 13 towns in my district about concerns about these changes,” Gordon said. “So for me, I didn’t think the changes were going to work out well. I wasn’t certain why the legislature wanted to make more changes.”
Collins and Betsy Gara, executive director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns, said part of the sudden shift came about because cars were valued much higher during the COVID-19 pandemic when supply chain issues caused the cost of new and used vehicles to spike.
“Values for motor vehicles, including used motor vehicles, went up significantly,” Gara said. “And as a result, when they moved from the NADA values to the MSRP, it ended up dropping a town’s grand list pretty significantly, particularly if they had just undergone revaluation.”
Gara said she’s hopeful that towns will adjust to the change.
“Hopefully, over time, the changes will even out. But for this year, in particular, towns took a big hit,” she said.
Collins said in the long run, the change will likely make it easier for towns to plan their budgets because it’s a more predictable system.
“Anytime you implement a significant change in how something’s done, there’s going to be wrinkles to it,” he said. “So we’re hoping that after a year, when things settle out, it’ll be a better system.”
Florsheim pushed back against this idea, and pointed out that while towns may adjust to the change, their grand lists will still be smaller.
“When does it actually start breaking even in such a way that is beneficial for taxpayers?” he said. “And I think this sort of herky-jerky back and forth ‘We’re going to do it this way, we’re going to do it that way,’ it’s caused an incredible amount of uncertainty at the local level.” 
Jennifer Lineaweaver, president of the Connecticut Association of Assessing Officers, said the change has “excellent benefits,” including shielding the grand list properties from market swings such as the one that occurred during COVID. It also makes it more efficient for assessors to figure out the value of vehicles, she said.
“Not dealing with pricing all of those MVS in the fall, allows assessors more time to discover, list and value previously untaxed property,” Lineaweaver said in an email. 
She added that part of the drops in town revenue also resulted from a new veteran tax exemption on real estate. She said passing the exemptions has had more influence on town revenues than some might expect.
Rather than the legislature further adjusting the car tax process, “they could stop passing unfunded state mandates and stop passing new exemptions,” she said.
The tax changes are part of a larger conversation about equity in Connecticut’s car tax system. The car tax is based on mill rates, which vary from town to town. This means that people can pay different amounts in taxes for the same car depending on where they live.
Republican Gov. Jodi Rell proposed plans to at least partially do away with the tax in 2006 and 2007. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, proposed a car tax repeal in 2013. Both proposals failed.
Abolishing the car tax has also been a special interest of Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, since he first took office in 2023.
Rahman was among the 24 lawmakers who signed onto the Senate’s 2024 amendment to offer towns the option to phase out the car tax over a five-year period. 
The amendment surprised members of the House, who had negotiated and struck a deal to change the car tax over the course of two years. That deal didn’t include a phase-out, and some members worried that could put too much burden on property owners, who would likely bear the brunt of significant changes to municipal revenue sources.
This session, Rahman is working on a bill separate from the changes to the valuation system that would phase out the car tax. He’s trying to find a way to replace the revenue, he said.
“That’s a really regressive, complicated, unfair tax,” Rahman said. “Because two different Jeeps cost two different taxes.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0225_SR_ParkedCars_003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-10 15:12:44.255254

What could the tragic 19th Century Irish potato famine have to do with modern Medicaid work requirements promoted by North Carolina Republicans?
As author Padraic Scanlan documents in a powerful new book, the parallels between what the men running the British Empire did to the peasants of Ireland nearly two centuries ago and the policies North Carolina legislative leaders are pursuing today are quite striking.
As Scanlan documents in horrific detail, one of the chief contributors to the famine — a disaster that caused more than 1.5 million people to die or flee the tiny country — was the refusal of the British politicians and landowners who ruled Ireland to distribute relief because they thought it would violate rules of the free market and encourage laziness among the peasants.
Sound familiar? It should.
The bottom line: Medicaid work requirements won’t kill as many people as the pro-starvation policies of the British in Ireland, but some will die and the maddening arrogance of the policy makers in the two situations is essentially indistinguishable.

If it wasn’t the advocacy gathering on Tuesday, it could have been the calls and emails legislators received amid the budget process, according to some that attended the event.
“I have never in my entire time in the Statehouse received more emails and phone calls from individuals … advocating for their libraries,” said House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, to cheers from the crowd.
Republican House Speaker Pro Tempore Gayle Manning also said she’s “been receiving a lot of emails lately,” as has state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland.
“It is very clear what your interests are,” said Cirino, who will face budget negotiations head-on as the budget discussion heads for the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is the chair.

Cirino made no guarantees about funding, partly because the House had not finished their discussions of the omnibus bill as of Tuesday morning when he spoke to the crowd.

“No guarantees, don’t know what it’s going to end up as,” Cirino said. “But trust me, you’ve got a lot of us that really believe in libraries and what you do and what you bring to the communities.”
A summary of the omnibus bill released on Tuesday afternoon states that the current distribution of state funds to public libraries was put back, instead of a proposed “population-based formula” initially written into the House budget draft. The omnibus bill is set to be put to a vote on Wednesday.
The new budget amendment appropriates $490 million in fiscal year 2026 for the Public Library Fund, and $500 million in fiscal year 2027.
The House budget proposal, even with the restoration of the PLF, comes in at a lower allocation than Gov. Mike DeWine proposed in his executive budget, which had an increase to the fund from 1.7% to 1.75% of tax revenue in the General Revenue Fund.
According to the Ohio Library Council, DeWine’s proposal would have allocated $531.7 million in 2026 and $549.1 million the year after.
DeWine praised libraries at Tuesday’s event, and said, of funding public libraries as it has been done for the last century, “I think that’s probably something that really should be continued.”
“Our libraries are really at the center of each community,” DeWine said. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s in an inner city, it doesn’t matter whether it’s in Harrison County or any of our smaller counties.”
Asked for tips on advocating as the budget moves on to the Senate, the governor said engaging directly with the senators in individual districts would make the most impact, and give them the perspective of those in their communities.
“We all react to people and we react to stories,” he said. “Statistics are interesting, stories are people.”
Anne Rhodes and Allison Howell, of the Mansfield/Richland County Public Library, were more than happy to give DeWine and others the story of their library, which not only provides reading services, but also a “library of things” where residents can rent items such as power tools and board games. The library can help convert old VHS tapes and other old recording types for free, and brings their bookmobile to nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
Rhodes said a community member told her his mother gets books from the bookmobile monthly, looking forward to the delivery every time.
“He said it has just changed her world,” Rhodes said. “It gives her something to do and keeps her interested, and she’s excited to see what she gets every month.”
The “library of things” not only saves people the cost of buying a power tool or musical instrument that they may only need temporarily, but helps enrich lives without the burden of cost, Howell said.
“We have kids come in and they get so happy that they can get a board game that they can play with their parents because they may not be able to afford a board game,” she said.

Library patrons were panicked when they heard news that state funding might be at risk, according to Rhodes.
“When they started talking about these budget cuts, I don’t know how many phone calls we got in our office, pretty much immediately with people, their hair was on fire,” Rhodes said. “I’ve had people call in tears that they’re worried about the cuts.”
Russo, Manning, Cirino, and state Sen. Beth Liston, D-Dublin, all spent some of their time at the library advocacy event explaining how their local libraries benefitted them, from reading help when they were children, to helping their own children, and giving them space to hear from constituents on the issues of the day. Now, more than ever, legislators said libraries are in need of support.
“I think everyone will agree that in our changing times, there has been a huge need for places where people can come together and gather and feel part of things,” Liston said. “I would agree that it is critical that we maintain the funds for the library system through our public library funding.”
Cirino didn’t question the value of libraries, but as the budgeting process goes forward into his committee and the Senate, he said a big question will be: “How much can we afford to support it?”
“I think like everybody else that we appropriate, it should be a biennial appropriation process that’s justified based on input and feedback that we get, not an automatic number,” Cirino told media after he spoke to the library group. “… I think the way that the House presented it in their sub bill (with a population-based formula) … I think will actually be better off for libraries.”
Russo said changes to the Public Library Fund that would reduce the monies going to those entities, even more so than the $27 million public libraries lost over the last year, would bring the costs back to the residents. Without state funding, libraries are forced to ask for property tax levies to supplement the costs of business and performing what Russo said are “critical needs in our communities.”
“When we take money away from those efforts that are being done very well in our communities, that actually costs us money in the longterm,” Russo told the Capital Journal. “The reason that our communities have to keep going back to local residents is because we are not doing our share here at the Statehouse.”

Ohio state senators took up the House version of a broad-based energy bill Tuesday aimed at encouraging new power generation. Backers warn the regional energy grid known as PJM is teetering on the verge of shortfall. Forecasts suggest energy demands could outpace supply as soon as next year.
With those alarms ringing in their ears, lawmakers in the House and Senate have been advancing bills on parallel tracks. Both chambers approved their proposals in recent weeks with broad bipartisan support.

But Tuesday’s hearing wasn’t the beginning of a fast-track process. Senators cancelled a follow up hearing scheduled for Wednesday and they’re preparing to leave town on a two-week recess. In the House, meanwhile, attention is focused squarely on the budget.
Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, who heads up the Senate energy committee explained they haven’t yet settled on which bill will be the vehicle for passage.
“We haven’t figured that out yet. The House is focused on the budget right now,” Chavez said after committee.
“I think we’ll pick one and we’ll just go with it,” he added, “and we’ll blend them together and hopefully come up with a really solid bill.”
There’s agreement on the broad strokes, but with lawmakers headed for the exits, hammering out the details might stretch into May. And despite wrestling over language for months, lawmakers and stakeholders have a few additional tweaks in mind.
What’s distinct about HB 15
Both proposals encourage new power plant investment with tax incentives and assurances that monopoly distribution companies (think AEP, Duke or FirstEnergy) can’t jump into the marketplace. They also shake up how those distribution companies set rates, and repealing a widely criticized subsidy for aging coal plants.
Ohio House approves sweeping energy generation bill

But HB 15 carries a handful of additional provisions. Utilities would have to create “heat maps” reflecting energy capacity on quarterly basis. The state power siting board would gain oversight of transmission projects that currently have little. Critics argue that allows companies to make big investments and pass the cost on to ratepayers. The House bill also includes a pilot program for community power where small groups could chip in on new power generation to defray their existing power bills.
The Senate bill includes a program loaning schools money for solar from an existing fund.  The House instead would eliminate it and refund the balance to consumers.
Ideas
Senators sitting on the Energy committee heard another round of the suggestions they’ve heard before. AEP Ohio’s Steve Nourse asked lawmakers for a “glide path” off the coal plant subsidies. Those subsidies are the result of 2019’s House Bill 6 which is at the center of the largest corruption case in Ohio’s history. Consumers have already spent close to half a billion dollars on propping up the plants.
Utilities, barred from any role in energy production under HB 15, urged lawmakers to let them get involved “behind the meter” — providing on-site power plants for big customers like data centers.
The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis suggested lawmakers should remove or revise a section in the bill about customer refunds.
“It may have the unintended effect of prohibiting a refund opportunity that currently exists for consumers,” she argued.
The bill allows customers to collect refunds from the date of an Ohio Supreme Court decision rather than the date when charges began. Her office is pursuing refunds right now on behalf of half a million Ohioans who get their power from AES, the company that used to be Dayton Power and Light.
House Bill 15 gives the Public Utility Commission of Ohio a “shot clock” for many of its ratemaking decisions. State Sen. Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro, asked about adding one for an annual revision process. The House sponsor, Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, said he’s willing to consider it. But after the hearing, Chavez said “I don’t know why the PUCO wouldn’t be diligent about it.”
“We’re trying to let everyone do their job without putting too many restrictions on them,” he added, “because everyone wants to do the right thing. So, it’s something that we’ll talk about.”
Chavez acknowledged he scheduled two hearings in case negotiations moved quickly, and they wanted to get the bill to the Senate floor Wednesday. “We prepared for the possibility,” he said. The Committee’s ranking member, Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, added, “Some of it is we want to have conversations with the House.”

Mike DeWine is throwing his support behind a new bill that would require schools to create a policy banning students from using cellphones during the school day. 
State Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, recently introduced Ohio Senate Bill 158, which would ban cellphones in schools. The bill had sponsor testimony Tuesday in the Ohio Senate Education Committee. 
“We need to be sure that our classrooms, frankly, are now cellphone free,” DeWine said. “We all know that screen time is very, very addictive. Just having a phone nearby means students are receiving constant notifications all day long.”

Ohio law currently requires all districts to have a policy for student cellphone use in schools by July 1. Some schools already ban cellphone use, while other schools restrict cellphone use to only certain times of the day. Timken’s bill would take the law a step forward by outright banning the use of cellphones.
“This legislation is a common sense approach to unplug our children from the constant distractions that they have in the classroom,” Timken said. “It will reduce those distractions and allow instructors to facilitate the building of interpersonal relationships that are so vital to human development by eliminating cellphone use in our classrooms.”
A 2024 Pew Research study found that 72% of U.S. high school teachers say cellphone distraction is a major problem in classrooms. Students receive nearly 200 alerts per day on their cellphones, according to Statista. 
“Those notifications make it nearly impossible for students to focus and to learn,” DeWine said. 
He said he has heard positive things from parents, superintendents, principals, and teachers in districts where they have already banned cellphones during the school day.  
“Their kids are focused in the classroom, the lunch room is noisy,” he said. “Once again, kids are actually talking to each other. The kids are actually talking instead of burying their heads and their phones. Grades are better. Socialization is improving and becoming more positive. The number of students being disciplined is down. … The result has been, I think, overwhelmingly indicating that our children in Ohio are better off with no cellphones during the day.”
Timken said the hope is to pass the bill and potentially add it as an amendment to the budget. The Ohio House is expected to vote on the two-year budget Wednesday, sending it over to the Ohio Senate. Under S.B. 158, school districts would have to ban cellphone use by Sept. 1. 
One objection to banning cellphone use is a concern that students won’t be able to reach their parents during an active shooter situation, but Dublin City School District Superintendent John Marschhausen said that would only slow students down from escaping danger.
“If students are given directions and where to go, them looking down at their phones, it only slows the process as to what we’re trying to do, what we’ve practiced when it comes to evacuating, when it comes to lockdown, when it comes to shelter in place,” he said. 
At least 23 states have laws or policies that ban or limit students’ cellphone use in schools, according to Education Week.

(Photo by William F. Zorzi/Maryland Matters)Herbert J. Belgrad wasn’t much of a baseball fan. In fact, he wasn’t really a sports fan at all.
But on April 6, 1992, Belgrad, the first-ever chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority board, knew he had helped to create something special.
It was the first Opening Day at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and there sat Belgrad with then-Gov. William Donald Schaefer, watching as the bands played and the fans began to filter into those dark green folding seats. Bruce Hoffman, a former executive director of the authority, recalled the moment.
“I looked at the governor, and the tears were running down his face,” Hoffman said. “He was so freaking happy. And that’s when Herb really took the deep sigh and said: ‘You know, we pulled it off.’”
Belgrad, 90, died Sunday while on his regular morning walk along the Baltimore waterfront in Canton. Family members said he fell into the Patapsco, though they aren’t sure how exactly. They believe it could have been a heart attack, as he had recently developed heart issues.
The city’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled his death accidental, adding that it was caused by a heart condition, hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and complicated by drowning.
Belgrad was a labor and divorce lawyer who became an architect of the deals that brought the ballpark to life — and ensured the Orioles would remain in Baltimore to play there.
Born in Washington, D.C., Belgrad later attended City College high school in Baltimore and graduated cum laude from Johns Hopkins University, according to an online obituary from his family. A master’s degree from the University of Illinois and a law degree from the University of Maryland would follow.
Belgrad briefly served as an assistant city solicitor, before going into private practice at  Tydings and Rosenberg, where he became a partner. He was there from 1968 until his retirement in 2020.
But it was his volunteer work — especially at the stadium authority, but also with the Maryland State Ethics Commission, local bar associations and Jewish charities — that came to define his career.
Belgrad is survived by his wife of 65 years, Joanne Lott Belgrad, and their three children, Steve Belgrad, Susie Hayes and Leslie Finton, as well as eight grandchildren.

His children said Belgrad worked tirelessly, such that he didn’t have much time for hobbies. But they said he was always there for the important moments in their lives. Hayes said she has fond memories of late nights spent together, after he arrived home from work.
“He would perch at the dining room table, doing his work, and we would come in intermittently to interrupt him,” Hayes said.
Belgrad’s calm nature permeated the household, where loud family fights were practically unheard of, Hayes said. As a lawyer, Belgrad developed a knack for being an adversary without being adversarial.
“So many people, when they negotiate now, especially in business, it’s like a zero-sum game — what someone else wins is what someone else loses,” Steve Belgrad said. “He would come at issues around negotiation and stuff, with sort of an innate sense of fairness, and trying to get to an outcome that was going to be fair to both sides.”
Janet Marie Smith, the Orioles’ in-house architect during the construction of Camden Yards, said that Belgrad was a “pioneer” as the stadium authority’s first board chairman. Driven by immense civic pride rather than love of sport, Belgrad became a steadying hand for high stakes negotiations, which brought the Orioles downtown from the aged Memorial Stadium.
“Herb, as the leader, set a tone for really believing that this project was more than just solving a problem for the baseball team. It was the cornerstone of reinventing Baltimore,” Smith said.
At a critical decision point — deciding whether to keep the B&O Warehouse that became the backbone of Oriole Park — Belgrad was pragmatic rather than emotional, Smith said. He insisted that a study be performed, assessing the economics. Ultimately, the warehouse won out.
“There were many people who thought tearing down the warehouse would be of no consequence, because it was just, well, a warehouse. It wasn’t the U.S. Capitol,” Smith said.
“People were like: ‘Tear that ugly thing down. It’s just going to block the view of the city,’” Steve Belgrad said. “And he was very firm on, that’s what is going to add character.”
As Opening Day neared in 1992, the warehouse still hadn’t been restored. In fact, it looked “bombed out,” Smith said. It was Belgrad and Hoffman who went to the General Assembly and found the funds to rehab the outside, in time for first pitch, Smith said. The interior development came later.
Belgrad was proud to have Camden Yards on the national stage as host for the 1993 All-Star Game. Smith said she believes it helped raise the city’s profile in time to attract the Baltimore Ravens — even if the move came after Belgrad’s tenure as chairman.
Belgrad’s relationships with the General Assembly, Schaefer and even the Orioles were built on trust, said Hoffman, whom Belgrad appointed to serve as the authority’s first executive director.
“People trusted us, and they always trusted Herb,” Hoffman said. “He was just one of those people that you knew he was telling you the truth. And you knew that once he shook your hand, the deal was done.”
Mark Wasserman, a top aide to Schaefer, said that even though Belgrad was appointed board chairman by Gov. Harry R. Hughes, Schaefer opted to keep him around for the stadium project he envisioned transforming Baltimore.
He did so even though Belgrad had supported Schaefer’s opponent for governor, Maryland Attorney General Stephen H. Sachs, Wasserman said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The little blip politically was very quickly put to the side,” Wasserman said.
Once he became board chairman in 1986, he faced complex challenges: Quickly negotiating deals to relocate the commercial bakery, the middle school, the grocer and more that stood on the site of the ballpark. Negotiating a lease with the Orioles. Belgrad spearheaded it all. And in doing so, came to define the role of the stadium authority.
“The challenge was to take something, which was at that point, a shell of an organization — really just a piece of paper — and give it funding and give it direction,” Wasserman said.
Belgrad did just that.
Belgrad also exerted a considerable amount of effort to bring an NFL team to Baltimore, but he knew that memories of the Baltimore Colts’ departure in the middle of the night still stung.
“He was very hesitant to sort of do to another city what happened to Baltimore,” Belgrad said. “And so he focused on trying to get the expansion teams, which didn’t happen.
His children said he was known to wear a pair of sweatpants that advertised the “Baltimore Cardinals,” after an unsuccessful bid to attract the then-St. Louis Cardinals football team to Charm City.
For John Moag, the stadium authority board chairman who came next, Belgrad became a valued confidant.
“Most of the time when we met to talk, I was either asking him for advice, or we were talking about family,” Moag said.
Joe Spear, retired senior principal for architectural firm Populous, which was then HOK Sport, said he remembered Belgrad’s even-keeled nature more than anything.
“He clearly believed that business should be conducted in a normal tone of voice. You disagree, and you might be passionate about it, but there’s no real call to be shouting at somebody,” Spear said.
Belgrad was also disciplined, Spear said. He would host the Orioles, the architects and the stadium authority at his law office for meetings, and he would ensure that lunch was on offer. But not for himself.
“He came in, and he had his brown bag and we’re all eating this catered lunch, and he’s there with his sandwich,” Spear said.
A funeral service for Belgrad will take place Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at Sol Levinson’s Chapel in Pikesville.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/This-One-IMG_6552-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 04:59:45.326522

As smartphones only become more prevalent for kids, [&#8230;]","Photo by WEWS.As Ohio lawmakers move to ban cell phones in public schools, some parents raise concerns about being able to check in — or say goodbye — to their kids during active shootings.
“My teens use their cell phones for just about everything,” Cincinnati mom Natalie Hastings said.
As smartphones only become more prevalent for kids, schools and parents are trying to crack down on the distractions.
“It’s a very regular part of the routine to give up their phone at the beginning of class,” Hastings added.
She explains that she has boundaries when it comes to cell phone usage — and her school district has too, allowing students to have phones during lunch but not in class.
“It did seem to cut down on some of the, during the day, recording people surreptitiously in the restroom or something,” she continued.
Last year, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law mandating that every public school district make a policy regarding phone usage in schools. But this year, he wants to go even further.
“Those notifications make it nearly impossible for students to focus and to learn,” DeWine said during a press conference Tuesday.
He and state Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, have introduced S.B. 158, which would ban the use of cell phones for students in public schools.
“This legislation is a common sense approach to unplug our children from the constant distractions,” Timken said.
All districts put policies in place to limit phone usage during the day, with some banning them outright. But this bill makes sure that the remaining schools take the summer to create a total prohibition. However, it doesn’t say how they must ban them.
“I don’t understand, will they be in their cars and then they’ll get stolen out?” Hastings said.
Some schools require students to keep their cell phones in magnetically locking “Yondr” bags. Others just collect them in a box at the beginning of class. The mom argues that this is the good thing about local control.
“The local districts know better than the state what’s going to work where they are,” she said.
This could be seen as an unfunded mandate, as Parma Superintendent Charles Smialek said in 2024.
There would be some exceptions, such as if the student has a health concern or if it’s needed for learning disabilities — like under an individualized education program (IEP) or 504 plan.
Although Hastings is generally supportive of the idea of limiting phone use, she can’t help but fear for what happens during an emergency.
“The number one school safety problem is guns, regardless of the type and size of the school,” Hastings said, noting that in the Uvalde shooting in 2022, numerous children called 911 for help as the perpetrator shot 19 students and two teachers — also injuring nearly 20 others. “Phones have been very useful in situations with the shooter threat.”
We asked the governor about this.
“Schools, with advice from experts, have been working very, very hard to have a protocol and to follow that protocol,” the governor responded. “I think most experts look at this and think the use of cell phones many times will interfere with the execution of that protocol.”
Dublin City Schools Superintendent Dr. John Marschhausen explained why he thinks that is.
“If students are given directions on where to go, them looking down at their phones, it only slows the process as to what we’re trying to do,” Marschhausen, the top administrator at the Columbus suburban district, said.
Other parents reached out, and some social media users argue that sending one text to your parent that you are OK or that you love them wouldn’t cause a disaster.
“I am less worried about being able to get in touch with my child,” Hastings said. “I’m more concerned with them being able to get in touch with me.”
Marschhausen also added that there is already a reunification system for families.
“A reunification site only means so much if you can’t reunite with them,” the mother said.
The Senate bill will likely be heard quickly over the coming weeks. However, a provision was added to the House’s proposed budget that may pass the House Wednesday.

The administration usually refers to these “others” with collective nouns.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The Trump administration has warned that several groups want to take many things away from white, working-class Americans: their jobs, their belief that there are only two genders, and their right to go to libraries with books that exclude almost everyone except them.
The administration usually refers to these “others” with collective nouns. Immigrants, LGBTQs, minorities. The vilification of DEI programs primarily focuses on such groups, but it encompasses more.
My concern is that people with disabilities will be the next targets.
Until the 1970s, those with disabilities were usually referred to by collective nouns. “The mentally ill,” “the retarded,” “the handicapped.” Such terminology turns a group into an “other,” with members who are not like us — perhaps less than human. The “otherness” gives rise to stereotypes and misinformation.
Unlike some “others,” people with disabilities haven’t been the subject of dislike or hatred for most of our country’s history, in part because they were mostly invisible. If they were mentally disabled, they were sent to institutions. The intent was to give them asylum from the chaos of modern life; the effect was to separate them from the community, often for the rest of their lives. If they were physically disabled, they couldn’t enter most buildings. Architects designed buildings without elevators or ramps, but not because they didn’t want people in wheelchairs to enter the building. They didn’t think about “the crippled” at all.
Spurred on by the civil rights movement, those with disabilities and their advocates pushed for laws prohibiting discrimination based on disability. Two federal laws (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act) prohibit discrimination based on disability in several areas, including employment, education and public accommodations. Neither law requires affirmative action. Both require that a qualified disabled person may be entitled to reasonable accommodation (such as installing ramps at a building’s entrance, making doorways and toilets accessible to people in wheelchairs, or allowing service animals in a building that prohibits all animals) to give them the equal opportunity to that of nondisabled people.
I am not aware of any evidence that disabled people take away jobs from nondisabled workers, groom children to become disabled or force nondisabled schoolchildren to feel guilty about our country’s history of mistreatment of “the handicapped.” But in what appears to be an increasingly fact-free political environment, it’s possible that the disabled community could be targeted as the next “other,” subject to social media attacks and cutbacks to governmental funding and legal protections.
Perhaps the attack will be that many mentally ill people commit heinous crimes or that the mentally ill homeless are soiling our cities and panhandling citizens for money to buy drugs and alcohol. Both attacks are based on stereotypes: mentally ill people are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators. It is estimated that less than a third of homeless people have severe mental illness.
The problems of crime and homelessness are too complex to be blamed solely on mental disability.
In September 2024, 17 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services over a regulation stating that “gender dysphoria” should be considered a disability under Section 504. One count of the complaint stated that Section 504 should be declared unconstitutional.
In response to reaction from several groups, the plaintiffs stated it was not their intention to repeal Section 504. While the attack on Section 504 seemed to be an afterthought in this case, it may not be the last.
There is a difference between the current “others” and people with disabilities. The status of disability is not always fixed at birth. While there are some disabilities that are present then, many more disabilities are acquired at various stages in life: from an accident, illness or act of violence. Many people who are now not disabled may become disabled later in life. Those people decrying the presence of various groups in this country may never be an immigrant, a member of the LGBQT+ community, or a member of a minority race. But they may someday become disabled.
Would they want to say a litany that includes: “Then they came for the disabled, and I did not speak out because I was not disabled”?

Gov. DeWine’s cannabis, gambling, and tobacco tax increases were out, and his proposed child tax credit was removed. The bill also included tax cuts for coal mining, a new tax expenditure to support anti-abortion advocacy centers, and many other changes to tax, budget, and other policy areas.
Maybe the most historic change introduced in the new bill, however, was a proposal to eliminate the state’s public library fund, which has funded Ohio’s library system for the past 100 years.
To be clear, this is not a total elimination of public library support, just the fund. The new bill folds the special line item into the state’s general revenue fund. The proposed House budget still provides public library funding from the general revenue fund, though it does cut the governor’s proposal to fund libraries by 9% — a $100 million reduction.
Ohio ranks near the middle of the pack on a lot of metrics. Its library system is not one of those. Ohioans visit their libraries 3.41 times a year on average — second highest among all states across the country. The average Ohioan checks out over 12 books a year — more than any other state in the country. Two-thirds of Ohioans have a library card, which puts it second among states in that category.
In the early days of my firm Scioto Analysis, I pondered a lot about market failure. Okay, I still do, but at the time I had a lot fewer clients to keep me occupied. I recall being on the phone with my benefit-cost analysis professor from graduate school asking him what services libraries provide to correct market failures.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At the time, I was very focused on circulation: how does provision of books help correct market failures?
What I missed at the time was right in front of me. I built Scioto Analysis at the library. I would bike there daily to have a place to work away from home. I would reserve conference rooms so I had places where I could have in-person or online meetings. I used their computers to do work and had a place to print RFP responses — a nice resource for someone who hasn’t owned a printer in years.
Entrepreneurs aren’t the only people who benefit from libraries. A study out this year in the American Economic Journal found investments in public libraries lead to increased test scores for children who lived nearby. This means libraries are also helping build tomorrow’s workforce.
Economist Howard Fleeter estimates Ohio’s libraries provided physical and electronic circulation, computer and technology services, reference services, programs, and other services to the tune of a total value of $3.1 billion in 2019. Comparing this to the total operating cost of the system of $780 million, Fleeter estimates the system generates about $4 in economic benefits for every $1 in operating expenses.
There are certainly other benefits to public libraries. Services to low-income people and people struggling with housing security, as a place for children to spend time after school, and civic benefits from people having a place to be around others free of charge are all values of the library. The economic benefits are real, however, and they could be threatened by proposed cuts at the state level.

Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
Measles outbreak mounts among children in one of Texas’ least vaccinated counties

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Flu deaths rise as anti-vaccine disinformation takes root

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Bruce A. Lewandowski speaks to reporters inside the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Providence, R.I., on Tuesday, after Pope Francis announced that Lewandowski would become the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Providence. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)When the first Trump administration planned a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants six years ago, the Most Rev. Bruce A. Lewandowski, an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, spoke out.
“If something is wrong, it’s up to the church to speak out,” Lewandowski told reporters Tuesday. “To be human is to be political, right?”
His comments came Tuesday morning as Lewandowski was formally introduced as Pope Francis’ pick as the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Providence (R.I.) at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul — a little more than five months after his predecessor left to lead the Archdiocese of Boston.
Lewandowski will officially be installed to his new duties May 20. Lewandowski is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, something he was quick to showcase during his Rhode Island introduction. He was often brought to tears as he spoke in Spanish.
“Con más de 30 años sirviendo a la comunidad Hispana, es mi vida,” he said. (“With more than 30 years serving the Hispanic community, this is my life.”)
A native of Toledo, Ohio, Lewandowski grew up on a farm before being ordained a priest in 1994 in Washington D.C. He did missionary work in the Caribbean and was a pastor in the Bronx and Philadelphia before serving in Baltimore.
He succeeds the Most Rev. Richard Henning, who was selected by Pope Francis last August to lead the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. Henning commended Lewandowski’s appointment to his former diocese.
“I have a deep love for that diocese and its people, and I am grateful that the Holy Father has chosen a joyful and energetic young bishop who speaks Spanish and Portuguese and has experience in pastoral planning,” he said in a statement. “I wish Bishop Bruce Lewandowski every blessing as he exercises his ministry in the state of hope!”
Henning was on the job for a little over a year, himself succeeding the ever outspoken Thomas Tobin in May 2023. Tobin often used social media to share his unapologetic stance against abortion and same-sex marriage.
Henning, meanwhile, tried to stay out of politics — save for using the influence of the diocese to push for a ban on assault-style weapons and raising his pro-life stance.
Lewandowski has been especially vocal against mass deportations conducted by the Trump administration, which he compared to “an act of domestic terrorism” in 2019. His stance has not softened since then.
“A humane enforcement of immigration laws that respects the dignity of every person is what’s in order, “ Lewandowski told reporters Monday. “Rounding up people, using fear and manipulation as a tactic to drive people away, the politics of harassment — I don’t think there’s a place for that, it doesn’t go with the way Jesus treated people.”
Pope Francis too has been critical of Trump’s immigration policies. He sent a letter to U.S. bishops on Feb. 10 saying that criminalizing undocumented immigrants and taking measures built on force “will end badly.”
The church has historically advocated for the rights and dignity of everyone, Lewandowski said.
“Every person reflects the image and likeness of God,” he said. “We’re here to protect, defend and care for and nurture that in every single person — man, woman and child — from conception to natural death.”
‘Heaven on Earth’
Lewandowski, 57, received the news about his new job on March 29 while driving around “the wilds of Maryland.”
He said he received a call from the apostolic nuncio to the United States asking one question: Was he alone? After confirming he was, Lewandowski was told he was moving to Rhode Island.
He said Tuesday he was still in disbelief that he was chosen to serve in “a beautiful place” such as Rhode Island.
“I think it’s a piece of Heaven on Earth,” he said.
As he assumes the role of bishop, Lewandowski said he intends to meet people wherever they are at — especially if there’s a meal involved.
“I love to eat,” he said. “I’ve been accused of begging but I love ice cream, chocolate, cake, cookies, pies, I have a terrible sweet tooth — I’m surprised I have any teeth left.”

Brian Kemp to veto a bill that increased needs-based grants for college students. Kemp signed dozens of new laws and vetoed 14 bills in 2023. File photo by Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia General Assembly concluded its 2025 legislative session on Friday with the passage of roughly 400 bills and resolutions combined.
The abrupt end of the session gave way to a 40-day window that runs through May 14 when Gov. Brian Kemp can veto or sign legislation, or do nothing and automatically let it become law.
The last day of the session, when House and Senate lawmakers usually crank out legislation right up until midnight and celebrate at the end of the night by throwing torn-up pieces of paper into the air, was unexpectedly cut short.
In previous years, the Republican governor has vetoed about 10 bills each year, signed hundreds of pieces of legislation into law, and hosted a few ceremonies to ink some noteworthy bills with a keepsake pen. Last year, Kemp vetoed a dozen bills.
Kemp signed six bills before the General Assembly’s final gavel of fell, including a controversial so-called religious freedom bill.
Kemp is expected to hold a public ceremony prior to May 14 to sign his priority legislation for 2025 that is intended to limit the amount of damages juries award in civil lawsuits.
Kemp successfully fought off robust opposition to the civil litigation overhaul outlined in Senate Bill 68 and the more narrowly written Senate Bill 69 that requires transparency when third-party groups finance civil suits.
Kemp will also have the opportunity to publicly sign off on a school safety plan in the wake of September’s deadly shooting at Barrow County’s Apalachee High School. That high-profile measure creates deadlines to transfer student records to new school districts, establishes a statewide school threat alert system and requires Georgia schools to install panic buttons.
Kemp will also decide how he will handle a slate of culture war bills, including a ban on transgender athletes in girls’ sports in K-12 and college and another measure banning gender-affirming care in the state’s prisons.
Culture war issues, including new restrictions on transgender Americans, have been a priority of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration since he took office in January.
Georgia’s legislative smorgasbord awaiting Kemp includes next year’s nearly $38 billion budget as well as the accelerated income tax cut he championed and one-time income tax refunds set to be distributed to Georgia taxpayers later this year.
Usually, a statement from Kemp’s office explains why he vetoed a particular measure.

Wes Moore adds his signature to prescription drug affordability legislation passed by the General Assembly, it will highlight how his values on this life-saving issue contrast with those of his predecessor, Larry Hogan, writes Vincent DeMarco.","Ceremonial pens staged for the first of five bill signings after the 2025 session of the General Assembly. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)When Gov. Wes Moore adds his expected signature to landmark prescription drug affordability legislation passed by the General Assembly, it will highlight how his values on this life-saving issue are in stark contrast to those of his predecessor, Larry Hogan.
From the beginning of his tenure, Moore worked to empower Maryland’s first-in-the-nation Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB).  By contrast, Hogan undermined and hindered the PDAB’s work.
In 2019, the Maryland General Assembly, led by Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), now chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, passed legislation creating the PDAB. Hogan neither signed nor vetoed it, letting it become law without his signature.
But the next year, when the General Assembly passed legislation to fund the PDAB, Hogan vetoed it. Although the General Assembly overrode this veto the following year, Hogan’s callous action delayed its work. Further, Hogan slow-walked key appointments to the PDAB and its Stakeholder Council, which also hurt the PDAB’s ability to operate.

Under the original 2019 law, the PDAB was supposed to set up a process for making high-cost drugs more affordable for the state government and local governments by the end of 2022; the General Assembly would then decide in 2023 whether to authorize the PDAB to help all Marylanders afford their drugs. But, because of Hogan’s roadblocks, the PDAB could not meet this timeline and, therefore, the General Assembly did not act to expand the board’s authority that year.
Then Moore came to the rescue. In his inaugural address, he said it was a priority to ensure all Marylanders have quality, affordable health care. He knows that this cannot be done without making high-cost prescription drugs more affordable.
Many Marylanders have trouble affording life-saving drugs, forced to choose between purchasing their medications or paying for other necessities of life. But additionally, high drug costs affect all of us, as we are forced to pay higher health insurance premiums. The large drug corporations argue they need to charge these outrageous prices, which are much higher than anywhere else in the world, to fund research. But the truth is that big Pharma spends far more on advertising and profits than on research.
In 2023, working with the General Assembly, Moore allocated a critical $1 million for the PDAB, which helped jump-start its work after Hogan’s veto had stalled it. The governor knew the state would recoup that money many times over from saving money on high-cost drugs. The governor and General Assembly also passed new legislation confirming the PDAB’s authority to help state and local governments afford their drugs.
This board’s hard work and support from Gov. Moore are starting to pay off. Under the leadership of Chair Van Mitchell and Executive Director Andrew York, the PDAB is poised this year to make high-cost drugs more affordable for the state government and local governments, saving Maryland taxpayers millions of dollars.
Based on this, and with the support of the Moore administration, the General Assembly, led by Dels. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery) and Jennifer White Holland (D-Baltimore Coutny) and Sens. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel) and Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), just passed legislation expanding the authority of the PDAB so it can help all Marylanders afford their high-cost drugs. The governor has pledged to sign this measure into law.
Wes Moore is not the only governor with the courage to stand up to the drug corporations. Following Maryland’s lead, Govs. Jared Polis of Colorado, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Jay Inslee of Washington signed strong PDAB laws in their states.  Unfortunately, one governor, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, outdid Larry Hogan by actually vetoing a PDAB bill.
We are very proud of the progress we are making in Maryland under Gov. Moore to make high-cost drugs more affordable. This is critical because drugs don’t work if people can’t afford them. We encourage other governors around the country to follow Governor Moore’s example.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0089-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-09 01:23:01.132484

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/04/09/disappointed-not-defeated-backers-of-failed-bills-say-they-wont-give-up-the-fight/,"Jessica Brady Reader is one of the many advocates who spend days, months, even years working for bills they believe will improve the lives of Marylanders -- and who will turn right around start working toward next year when this year's bill fails.","Renter advocates gather in Annapolis to call on lawmakers to pass Good Cause Eviction legislation in mid-February. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).Jessica Brady Reader and Lauren Petit told lawmakers the heart-wrenching stories of  their experiences with stillbirth and the emotional and financial toll it takes on a family, urging support for a bill that would grant a $1,000 tax credit to such families.
Reader felt that members of the House Ways and Means Committee were sympathetic to the issue, and she was hopeful for the bill’s chances. But the measure never got a committee vote, which Reader attributes to lawmakers having to prioritize other legislation as the end of session neared.
“I am disappointed the bill did not become law, but I am definitely not defeated,” said Reader, a Kensington resident who is already planning to be back in the legislature next year to lobby the issue
She is one of the many advocates who work long hours to push for bills every year that they believe will help their lives or the lives of fellow Marylanders — only to watch their work of days, months, sometimes years fall by the wayside as their bills die.
And just as many are quick to begin work for the next session. Reader had already committed herself to 2026 less than 24 hours after the end of the 2025 legislature.
“I am very proud that, if nothing else, we’re able to raise awareness through our advocacy this year,” Reader said.

Some advocates, like Reader and Petit, can only standby as their issues do not come up for a vote. Others saw their bills pass, but in a form they did not like. Still others have been fighting for years to see their proposals advance, but not far enough to become law.
For Matt Losak, executive director of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, 2025 was the latest in more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to pass so-called Good Cause evictions legislation.
He said advocates plan to be back next session to give the bill another run, after Senate Bill 651 stalled in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee right before the crossover deadline this year.
Losak said that the Good Cause legislation is desperately needed to protect renters, by requiring that landlords cite a specific reason when they do not renew a lease with a current tenant. The bill that failed this year would have allowed local jurisdictions to adopt such eviction policies.
“It is the essential legislation that will protect tens of thousands of Marylanders from unfair eviction. Even though it has not succeeded year after year, what has happened is it has succeeded in getting greater attention and greater support,” Losak said.
Forever battle against ‘forever chemicals’
Environmentalists at the Potomac Riverkeeper Network were “deeply frustrated and disappointed” about the failure of legislation to restrict PFAS chemicals, so-called “forever chemicals” for their extreme persistence in the environment. They are already planning to be back next year.
One bill would have limited the concentration of certain PFAS chemicals in the biosolids that come from wastewater treatment plants, and are often spread on farm fields. The bill did not get out of committee, in the face of opposition from wastewater treatment plant operators, but it is still desperately needed said Betsy Nicholas, the Potomac Riverkeeper Network’s, in a statement.
Nicholas said she looks forward to working with the bill’s sponsors, Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) and Sen. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), as well as the state Department of the Environment, to regulate PFAS in biosolids “through a combination of regulations and legislation.”
“There was too much agreement from too many stakeholders to walk away from the concept,” wrote Evan Isaacson, a senior attorney for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The nonprofit ShoreRivers also plans to keep advocating for the bill, as well as additional bans on PFAS — a shorthand for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — in consumer products, said Matt Pluta, the Choptank Riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs at the organization.
“The lack of progress on this year’s bill means continued use of PFAS-laden biosolids with no end date in site, which will further contaminate local groundwater and surface waters,” Pluta said in a statement. “This, in turn, increases health risks from contaminated drinking water, local seafood, and wild game.”
Another PFAS bill did advance — but not in the direction advocates wanted. They initially supported a bill banning certain PFAS from pesticides in Maryland, but pulled their support when lawmakers narrowed the definition of PFAS frustrating groups like Maryland’s Smart on Pesticides Coalition, who feared that it would loosen PFAS regulation elsewhere in the state.
“There will be conversations in the interim to figure out what the best way to move forward is. We want those important conversations to happen before making any decisions on next session,” said Bonnie Raindrop, the group’s coordinator.
Immigrant advocates said they also plan to come back next year after an emotional evening on the last day of the legislature when lawmakers pushed through migrant protections at the last minute, but stripped out one of the strongest protections — a prohibition on so-called 287(g) agreements between county police and federal immigration officials. Critics say the agreements allow local police to essentially act in an immigration capacity.
“We’ll be back next year — stronger, more organized and committed to ending 287(g),” said Cathryn Jackson, policy director for CASA, in a text Tuesday. “Every day this program stays in place, more families are harmed and the urgency for action increases.”
Members of Maryland’s immigrant populations had high hopes for House Bill 1222, which would have restricted 287(g) agreements. Lawmakers wound up adding other protections to the bill — to safeguard immigrants’ personal data and limit immigration agents authority in spaces like churches and schools. But with the clock ticking on the session, they stripped out 287(g) language as they rushed to pass a watered-down bill in the face of the Trump administration’s mass deportations.
Lawmakers pass watered-down immigrant protections bill in final minutes of 2025 session

Jackson said it was “deeply disappointing” that lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, “didn’t rise to the moment” and restrict 287(g) agreements this session, but said that the fight is “far from over.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” she said.
A second look at the Second Look Act
Another bill that advocates said was watered down was the Second Look Act, which would allow some people who served at least 20 years in prison to petition the court for a reduced sentence. That person couldn’t be convicted a sex offender and cannot have been sentenced without the possibility of parole.
After years of trying, House Bill 853, sponsored by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), passed this year and is now before the governor. But advocates are upset by a last-minute Senate amendment that makes the law unavailable to anyone convicted of killing a first responder.
The bill also narrowed Pasteur’s previously submitted bills by make the law available only to those convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 to 25, which would be about 350 people.
Yanet Amanuel, public policy director for the ACLU of Maryland, said individuals sentenced to life without parole should not have been excluded.
“Some of the most deserving people to receive a second chance are those serving LWOP [life without parole] sentences,” Amanuel said Tuesday. “People do change after 20 years. There are very deserving people who have been rehabilitated and…had mentors of people who were inside [prison].”
For advocates like Reader, each attempt is another chance to push their issue forward until, one day, their bill becomes law.
“This one didn’t quite make it across the finish line this time,” Reader said. “But we had gotten such positive feedback both in the Senate and the House when we testified, so I am pretty confident that we’ll be able to grow our support next session.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_feb18_renterrally_goodcause2-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 01:23:01.132484

Most of this money supports left-leaning causes, including LGBTQ organizations, illegal immigration services, and Planned Parenthood, which received $800,000 — the largest share. Other recipients include Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, New Haven Gay and Lesbian Community Center, and Hartford Gay and Lesbian Health Collective.
This spending was enacted via an “emergency certified bill,” circumventing standard legislative processes like public hearings. This is a shameless attempt to shovel federal waste and abuse onto state taxpayers. It’s a brutal slap to transparency and a sneering insult to good governance.
Connecticut taxpayers, who fund these causes, were denied a chance to weigh in. Imagine if the recipients leaned conservative instead — say, pro-life groups like the Connecticut Pregnancy Care Coalition (CPCC) rather than Planned Parenthood. The philosophical divide is stark: one sees abortion as ending a life, the other as a reproductive right. Should a pro-life resident be forced to fund Planned Parenthood through taxes? Or a pro-choice resident fund CPCC?
Switch the ideological bent to any conservative nonprofit, and progressive backlash would likely follow — perhaps justifiably. Taxpayer money, entrusted to lawmakers, should benefit all residents through neutral public goods like roads, sewers, or parks, not divisive causes. Nonprofits, by design, advance specific missions, so ideologically charged ones should rely on voluntary donations, not mandatory taxes.
This raises broader questions not only about fiscal responsibility and transparency, but also the proper role of government. It also warrants a deeper conversation on who and what should be funded, and by how much. After all, what politicians support is what they value.
Government funding of nonprofits has historical roots, taking shape during World War I and the Great Depression. The 1917 War Revenue Act spurred philanthropy with tax deductions for charitable giving. The nonprofit sector boomed in the late 1970s, growing 36% since 2000 to 1.8 million organizations, per Philanthropy Roundtable. Americans are generous, donating $557.16 billion in 2023, dwarfing the U.S. government’s $58.4 billion in international aid for FY 2025. Yet USAID faced scrutiny from the Trump administration for spending on DEI, LGBTQ initiatives, and other questionable projects, leading to an 80% funding cut.
Amid these federal reductions, Connecticut allocated its $3 million to nonprofits at risk.
The state has long supported nonprofits (albeit not as ideologically based), launching the Nonprofit Grant Program (NGP) in 2013. Since then, NGP has awarded over $130 million, backing nearly 750 projects. Today, 33% of Connecticut nonprofits receive state grants.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s biennial budget proposed $157 million for nonprofits, but the Connecticut Nonprofit Community Alliance (“The Alliance”) calls it insufficient. The group’s president, Gian Carl Casa, noted in a Feb. 5 press release that, without annualized federal ARPA funds, it’s effectively a $19 million cut. The Alliance is seeking $264 million, citing a “crisis,” emphasizing that nonprofits have 30% less buying power than in 2007, with 80% struggling to retain staff, 70% facing rising demand, and over 60% operating at a deficit or thin margins.
To address this, The Alliance urges “reasonable adjustments” to Connecticut’s fiscal guardrails — 2017 reforms that averted a financial crisis. They argue the state can balance discipline with funding for housing, mental health, and food security, claiming two-thirds of voters support this dual approach.
However, The Alliance’s $264 million ask isn’t pocket change. Connecticut’s fiscal guardrails — spending, revenue, and volatility caps, plus a bond lock — have been transformative since 2017, saving $170 million annually in pension debt payments. The state has cut nearly $10 billion in pension debt, enacted its largest income tax cut, and freed $700 million for vital services. If maintained, the guardrails could save $7 billion over 25 years.
Despite the General Assembly’s unanimous 2023 approval to extend them, Gov. Lamont wants to “rethink the volatility threshold,” while Comptroller Sean Scanlon has called for adaptability to address pressing needs. Yet, Connecticut lags in key economic indicators: it’s among the worst states for business, with high property taxes, a poor tax climate, and steep electricity rates.
Increased spending isn’t charity — it fuels inflation, raises living costs, and “crowds out” private investment, per Forbes. The fiscal guardrails offer a path to prosperity, and tweaking them risks undoing gains, harming creditworthiness, and raising future borrowing costs. With President Trump’s tariffs adding market uncertainty, caution is key — especially with the volatility cap, which saves unpredictable revenue (e.g., stock gains) to shield taxpayers from shortfalls.
Connecticut lawmakers must reject the notion that it’s the government’s role to bankroll ideologically charged nonprofits, especially at the expense of fiscal stability. The state’s duty is to serve all residents — through essential infrastructure, public safety, and economic opportunity — not to pick winners and losers among divisive causes like abortion, illegal immigration, or gender ideology.
Busting the fiscal guardrails to funnel taxpayer dollars into such polarizing missions isn’t just reckless; it’s a betrayal of the public trust. Government should not play philanthropist with money it doesn’t own, forcing citizens to fund agendas they may abhor. True charity comes from the heart, not the statehouse. By clinging to fiscal discipline and rejecting this overreach, Connecticut can safeguard its financial future and leave divisive missions to the realm of voluntary giving — where they belong.

In 2024 alone, the United States saw 16 measles outbreaks, quadruple the amount from the previous year. 
Hardly four months into 2025, 483 cases have been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control, with five outbreaks across the U.S. accounting for 93% of confirmed cases.
Despite this, some Connecticut lawmakers are considering reinstating religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements. If this proposal succeeds, we risk undoing decades of work by researchers, physicians, nurses, and public health officials; relegating us to a time where children suffered and died from preventable disease.
For many people, measles feels like a disease of the past. It’s something they’ve never seen and therefore may not be aware of its potentially devastating outcomes. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases in humans. Caused by a virus that spreads in the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, measles begins with a rash and fever, and can have serious complications including pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death. There is no treatment for measles; vaccination is our best defense.
Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, measles was responsible for approximately 2.6 million deaths each year, primarily affecting children. According to the World Health Organization, over 60 million measles-related deaths have been prevented by herd immunity from 2000 to 2023.
When vaccination rates exceed 95%, herd immunity is established against measles. This means that enough people have been vaccinated against the disease to protect the entire community. This provides protection for vulnerable populations who can’t receive the vaccine like newborns and those with weakened immune systems, such as children undergoing chemotherapy. The safety and well-being of these children are dependent on the decision of those around them to get vaccinated. For them, herd immunity can be lifesaving.
On January 8, Republican Sen. Eric Berthel proposed a new act to reinstate religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements. The bill never made it out of committee and is dead. But Connecticut should not be complacent on this issue. Resuming religious exemptions would negate the high vaccination rates Connecticut has worked so hard to maintain and open the door to public health and safety risks.
Connecticut has done an exemplary job in protecting communities through high vaccination rates, thanks largely in part to legislation passed in 2021 which eliminated religious exemptions from childhood vaccination requirements for public and private schools, colleges, and daycare facilities.
This change came on April 28, 2021, five days after two cases of confirmed measles in Fairfield County. Following this legislation, MMR vaccine coverage in Connecticut rose from 97.3% in 2022-23 to 97.7% in 2023-24, well above the actively declining national average of 92.7%.
As expected, the elimination of religious exemptions was met with backlash from parents and groups alike, claiming infringement upon their religious freedom and First Amendment rights. While most of these claims have been dismissed in court, one remains under review. Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong pledged to “aggressively defend the state’s necessary and lawful actions to protect public health,” regarding this final claim.
Exemption rates are increasing across the U.S., with 280,000, or 3.3% of kindergarteners being exempt from one or more vaccines. According to the CDC, vaccine coverage for measles is as low as 79.6% in states that allow religious exemption, far below the 95% necessary for herd immunity.
Parents who claim religious exemptions for vaccines not only endanger their own children by leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles but also put medically fragile children –who cannot be vaccinated for legitimate health reasons– at serious risk. By undermining herd immunity, these exemptions prioritize personal belief over public safety, forcing parents of vulnerable children to choose between their child’s education and well-being. High vaccination rates ensure equitable access to education for children who cannot be vaccinated.
Outbreaks carry a heavy cost. An analysis of 11 measles outbreaks in the U.S. between 2004 and 2017 cost on average $152,000 per outbreak and roughly $33,000 per case. This strains public health departments and forces them to divert funds from other initiatives to control measles outbreaks. Additionally, outbreaks increase healthcare costs and negatively impact the workforce by forcing parents of ill children to take time off.
High vaccination rates have kept millions of people safe from preventable diseases for decades, and the state of Connecticut has a duty to keep children safe. Reinstating religious exemptions would unnecessarily endanger vulnerable children, limiting their access to safe education. Outbreaks may reduce the quality of public health protection, and have proven costly to families, communities, and state budgets.
Maintaining the prohibition of the religious exemption protects not only the child next door, but also every vulnerable child dependent on herd immunity. Lawmakers should be urged to prioritize public health in their decision-making. By standing firm on current vaccination policies, we safeguard our classrooms, our communities, and our future.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska faces economic shocks from a tumbling stock market and an unstable oil market, leaders of the state House of Representatives are appealing to minority-caucus members and Gov. Mike Dunleavy to help balance the budget.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re all in a pickle,” House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham said in a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s not just the House majority: It’s the House minority; it’s the governor; it’s the Senate majority; it’s the Senate minority. We all own the situation in front of us.”
The House Finance Committee passed a budget on Thursday that includes $1.9 billion more in spending for the 12 months that begin in July than the state is forecast to raise. But Edgmon said that committee would continue to work on the bill to try to bring it into balance, as required by state law. 
Edgmon, I-Dillingham, noted that the budget faces several challenges, including oil prices dropping over the past week. And he said the 21-19 split in the House meant that any one member has a veto power to block legislation. The House majority consists of 14 Democrats, five independents and two Republicans, while the minority has 19 Republicans.
“We need to work together,” Edgmon said of the House minority, before addressing the governor’s office: “Please step up. Work with us. We’ll get through this. But if you leave us to our own designs, we are going to be stuck in this morass that unfortunately will carry forward into what none of us want: And that’s a special session.”
Two majority finance committee members — Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, and Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, D-Bethel — support Permanent Fund dividends at the level set under the formula in current law, which would be around $3,800 per resident and cost $2.46 billion. That size would make a balanced budget impossible without new taxes or significant draws from savings.
The value of the Alaska Permanent Fund fell by $3.2 billion, and Alaska North Slope oil fell from $76 per barrel to $65, in the days after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs. 
Before the majority news conference, the House minority held one of their own. Finance committee members Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, and Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, both said the draft budget must be reduced. They raised the possibility of reexamining any new programs or positions that were added in the current budget, which started last July, or were proposed in the draft budget, including a hotly debated education funding increase.
“It’s hard work,” Johnson. “It’s drudgery. … It’s not one of those things you approach with a lot of excitement. You have to approach that with a lot of work.”
Stapp questioned the affordability of the proposed increase in the funding per student in public education. House Bill 69 includes a $1,000 per student increase in the base student allocation, the core of the state’s funding formula. For the next school year, that BSA increase would equal $253 million.
“Ultimately, you’re going to have to take the education funding level and say, you want to prioritize education, but you probably can’t do a $1,000 BSA,” Stapp said. He said the increase should look more like the one-time boost in state funding for the current school year, which was $680 per student. In terms of the total budget, that education funding increase was $174 million, compared with the $253 million in the draft proposal.
In the majority news conference, leaders of that caucus took a different view.
Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said legislators shouldn’t even be raising the possibility of a Permanent Fund dividend using the formula in current law.
“I ran and campaigned on a balanced budget,” Kopp said, adding that he would have joined the other caucus if it agreed to a balanced budget and what he described as “the dividend we can afford.”
Kopp also emphasized that the majority is not proposing paying for a larger dividend with legislation to increase taxes or other revenue. He rejected increasing oil taxes, saying that the industry is still rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and he doesn’t want to discourage investment in future development.
Finance committee co-chair Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, said the draft budget includes some growth driven by necessity. As an example, he cited funding for child advocacy centers to interview children who have been sexually abused.  And he noted that most of the increase in the budget was proposed by Dunleavy, with additions for public employee contract increases. 
Josephson described the education funding increase as a “core principle.”
“We heard from scores of Anchorage citizens about the importance of that, and we have their back,” he said. “Come hell or high water, we’re going to stand for that principle.”
The legislative session is scheduled to end by May 21. Special sessions have been called in 2017 and 2021 to avoid partial state government shutdowns, which would occur if there isn’t a budget enacted by June 30.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday protecting coal and overhauling the Biden Administration’s sweeping rules that aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal power plants. 
Titled “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” the order directs his cabinet to move fast to increase coal-powered energy production in the country and to undo federal regulatory barriers that may prevent that task ahead of the anticipated rise of energy-hungry artificial intelligence centers and manufacturing activity.
“We’re slashing unnecessary regulations that targeted the beautiful clean coal. We will rapidly expedite leases for coal mining on federal lands (…) and we’ll streamline permitting,” Trump said during the announcement on Tuesday. “We will end the government bias against coal, and we’re going to unlock the sweeping authorities of defense production Act, the defense production act to turbocharge coal mining in America.”

While coal is a rock, not a mineral, the White House also required the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a mineral so that it’s covered by the protections established by a March executive order that creates a process to expedite mineral production projects in the country and allow leases for mineral extraction on public lands.
The executive order received applause from Republican lawmakers and coal miners who posed in the background as Trump announced the anticipated measures. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee showed his enthusiasm for Trump’s order, making multiple posts on X from his seat at the signing event. 
“Biden sought energy subservience. Trump wants dominance,” Lee wrote on X, quoting a post from Vivek Ramaswamy that read “Energy dominance is a requirement for manufacturing dominance.”
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

However, environmental and clean energy advocates were dismayed to hear the news, not only because of what it would mean for carbon emissions in the country.
Sarah Wright, CEO of Utah Clean Energy, said the executive order paints a false narrative that having an affordable, reliable energy system can’t happen at the same time that leaders address the consequences of climate change.
“The United States can be ‘energy dominant’ by investing in the next generation of energy resources. Wind, solar, geothermal, and storage represent the future and incredible opportunities for the U.S. to lead,” Wright wrote in a statement. “This executive order is firmly rooted in the past, setting the U.S. up to fall further behind countries like China that are leading in clean energy technology development and associated economic opportunities.”
The Sierra Club also wrote in a news release that alongside tariffs that would reverse renewable energy efforts, Trump’s policies are expected to raise monthly energy bills for Americans, since renewable energy can be 30% cheaper than coal. With increased carbon emissions, also come public health consequences, including respiratory and heart conditions, Sierra Club leaders said.
“This is the latest move in a pattern to force a plan that simply isn’t economical, and these orders won’t change that,” Luis Miranda, Sierra Club Utah senior organizer, said in a statement. “What they will do is delay a meaningful energy transition that could protect workers and create long-term, good-paying jobs. This band-aid approach does nothing but buy time from a clock that’s already run out.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The order, however, is in line with Utah’s energy policy, where there were already steps to facilitate coal-powered energy production. Utah Republican lawmakers have often referred to coal as an important component of their “all-of-the-above” energy strategy and have passed laws that, in essence, are meant to protect coal as other states make moves to adopt clean energy resources and phase out fossil fuels.
Rocky Mountain Power, Utah’s largest electric utility, also has plans to keep operating its two coal plants, Hunter and Huntington, indefinitely, eliminating their 2032 retirement plans. 
The executive order is hardly a surprise. Trump had already made clear his intentions to boost energy production and to “drill, baby, drill” since his inaugural speech. On Tuesday, he also referred to the Green New Deal, the Biden Administration’s flagship set of policies to address climate change, as the “green new scam” and took a jab again at the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to combat climate change that Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from. 
PacifiCorp extends the life of Utah coal-powered plants — indefinitely

Trump also signed another order on Tuesday titled “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” an action that requires the removal of “all illegitimate impediments” to developing coal and other resources, including oil, natural gas, hydropower, geothermal, biofuel, critical minerals and nuclear energy resources. 
“Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security,” the order reads, pointing to policy examples in New York, Vermont and California. 
Trump argued that clean energy efforts from those states influence the whole country and undermine federalism. So, he ordered the U.S. Attorney General to identify any state laws “purporting to address ‘climate change’ or involving ‘environmental, social, and governance’ initiatives, ‘environmental justice,’ carbon or ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes,” and to take action to stop their enforcement.
“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy,” Trump wrote in the order. “They should not stand.”

Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.An Iowa ag company accused of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme is being sued by a lender that says 110,000 piglets are at risk of starvation.
Compeer Financial of Minnesota is suing Sunterra Farms Iowa Inc., Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. in U.S. District Court. Compeer alleges that the three defendants operate extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, and have granted Compeer, their lender, exclusive security over their collective assets.
Compeer is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take control of the defendants’ assets so that Compeer can protect its collateral by continuing to provide for the feeding and care of 110,000 head of swine.
The defendant companies are allegedly operated by the Price family of South Dakota, including Ray, Art and Glen Price, who own and manage 110,000 head of swine in 54 barns located in and around Yankton County, South Dakota. The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra.
Compeer claims in the lawsuit that because of what it calls “the long-running fraud” perpetrated by the defendant companies, they cannot be trusted to operate their businesses and protect their assets, including the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County.
According to the lawsuit, the three defendant companies have engaged in check kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer’s lawsuit claims that earlier this year, the defendant companies were issuing each other numerous checks, in nearly identical amounts, on a daily basis — with some checks ranging from $800,000 to $990,000, an amount just below the threshold that would trigger scrutiny from regulators.
The transactions had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest, the lawsuit claims.
Compeer alleges that on Feb. 12, 2025, the day after it asked Ray Price, the CEO of the defendant companies, about the transactions, it received a batch of checks totaling $9 million drawn one of the defendants’ Canadian bank accounts for deposit into the defendants’ account with Compeer.
Later that day, the lawsuit claims, Ray Price admitted that the checks were intended only to prevent the Compeer account from being overdrawn, and acknowledged that if Compeer attempted to deposit the $9 million it would trigger a corresponding overdraft in the Canadian account. According to the lawsuit, Price admitted that what the companies were doing was “wrong.”
About 24 hours later, the lawsuit claims, Price spoke to Compeer personnel and said the Canadian account was overdrawn by roughly $21 million, adding that he needed Compeer to immediately “send the money back” to the Canadian bank to cover the overdraft. Compeer refused.
In late February, the lawsuit alleges, Compeer learned the Canadian bank had rejected 65 checks totaling $59.9 million previously credited by Compeer to the defendants’ accounts. As a result, the defendants’ $21 million positive cash balance at Compeer was instantly wiped out and replaced with a $36 million debt owed by the defendants to Compeer.
In its lawsuit, Compeer alleges that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions.
Court records show that on March 17, 2025, the Canadian bank asked that a receiver be appointed to look after the defendants’ assets. However, the listed assets in that case didn’t include the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County, or the 370,000 head owned by third parties and managed by Sunterra.
In court filings, Compeer says that over the past several weeks, it has provided funds necessary for the care and feeding of the Yankton County pigs, but says it is no longer willing to do so “while the parties who perpetrated this fraudulent scheme” remain in control of Sunterra, Sunwold and Lariagra.
“These swine are in imminent danger of starvation if feed is not promptly purchased and delivered to barns housing the pigs,” the lawsuit states, adding that workers hired to provide for the animals’ care may soon walk off the job given the Price family’s inability to make payroll.
If court appoints a receiver, Compeer states in its court filings, it will advance the money necessary to protect its collateral and prevent the animals’ starvation.
The Price family has not yet responded to the lawsuit and Sunserra declined comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for fraud and unjust enrichment. The lawsuit was initially filed in South Dakota state court before being transferred to federal court.

Maria Cantwell has emerged as a leading voice in Congress opposing President Donald Trump’s universal tariffs announced last week.
Her new bipartisan legislation to give Congress more authority over trade policy has more than half a dozen Republican cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. 
And on Tuesday, Cantwell was one of many senators who grilled the president’s top trade advisor after days of stock market turmoil, anxiety over the price of goods, and growing concerns about the country plunging into a recession.
“I represent a trade economy,” Cantwell told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. “I represent the success of what innovation and trade gets you. 
“You’re coming here telling me that tariff is the tool,” added the Democratic senator from Edmonds. “And I’m telling you innovation is the tool.”
Trump’s broad new tariffs, including 10% import taxes across the board and much higher rates on many other countries, are set to go into effect Wednesday. Some countries, including China, retaliated, or threatened to retaliate, with tariffs of their own. The president hopes the levies will boost domestic industrial production after decades of outsourcing.
After a strong start Tuesday, the S&P 500 was down over 1.5% at market close, despite signs the Trump administration could be open to negotiations on tariffs. The index has dropped nearly 11% in the past five days.
Back in this Washington, Republicans in Olympia said the tariffs, widely believed to drive up prices for consumers, are a matter of “some short-term pain for long-term gain.”
“I don’t claim to be an economic genius in any way, shape or form, but I’m going to wait and see,” state Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, told reporters Tuesday. “And hopefully it will land on the right place.”
But industry leaders here are worried tariffs will deal a debilitating blow to the state economy. 
And last week, Gov. Bob Ferguson called the tariffs “a direct threat to affordability and prosperity for families, communities, and businesses across Washington state.”
“It’s time for the president to step back from the brink of economic turmoil, and for the Congress to reassert its authority over trade policy,” he said.
The legislation
Cantwell’s bill seeks to add guardrails on the president’s trade power.
“As representatives of the American people, Congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm,” she said in a statement.
The legislation, spearheaded along with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley from Iowa, requires the president to notify Congress of the imposition or increase in a tariff within 48 hours. The notice must explain the rationale behind the levy and analyze how it could impact the country’s businesses and consumers.
Within 60 days, Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariff, or it would expire. And Congress could end tariffs at any time via resolution.
Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution says Congress “shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”
The bill, called the Trade Review Act of 2025, is modeled after the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a bipartisan law that aimed to stop presidents from going to war without congressional consent. Congress had to override then-President Richard Nixon’s veto to pass the law near the end of the Vietnam War.
On Tuesday, Cantwell castigated Greer for the Trump administration not preparing Congress for the emergency tariffs.
She said Trump “could have opened these conversations with these countries without the tariffs, and saved a lot of people a lot of pain and anguish.”
The bill has garnered some bipartisan support in the Senate and endorsements from retail and business trade groups.
An identical bill in the House has also earned some Republican backing, including central Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse, his spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.
But the proposal has little chance of being enshrined in law, as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has said Congress would be hands-off as Trump implements widespread tariffs. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, has said the idea doesn’t have a chance.
And the White House has said Trump would veto the bill if it reached his desk.
The fallout for Washington state
With about $60 billion in annual international exports, Washington is one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation. Two out of every five jobs in the state are linked to international trade, officials say.
“Washington state stands to lose among the most from Trump’s destructive trade war,” Sen. Patty Murray said on a press call.
For example, Trump imposed a 24% tariff on goods from Japan, potentially straining the relationship with Washington’s biggest destination for exported processed potatoes. 
The state is a top producer of apples, blueberries, hops, pears, spearmint oil and cherries, exports of which could also be targeted for retaliatory tariffs, said Lori Otto Punke, the president of the Washington Council on International Trade. 
Washington’s farmers have been here before. A tariff tug-of-war started during the first Trump administration forced Washington’s apple exports to India to plummet. Cherry exports to China also dropped precipitously due to tariffs.
A rising concern is budding anti-American sentiment among what used to be trade allies, like Canada, the top importer of Washington agricultural products, said Rianne Ham, of the state Department of Agriculture. Trust will be broken in trade relationships that took years to foster, she added.
State Commerce Director Joe Nguyen told reporters that tariffs on key trade partners like India, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea will “ripple throughout our economy.”
The tariffs on imports from Vietnam and Indonesia — 46% and 32%, respectively — will hurt coffee roasters and cafes, said Blas Alfaro, senior vice president at Fulcrum Coffee Roasters in Seattle.
“Those tariffs don’t just affect imports, they affect real people, local businesses and the community economy,” Alfaro said.
And while the goal of the tariffs is boosting domestic manufacturing, the tariffs will drive up the cost of materials used in manufacturing, Otto Punke noted.
The tariffs “disrupt industries like Boeing, our shipping terminals, our farmers, our tech companies,” Nguyen said. “All of this is on the line.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/container-ship-port-of-seattle-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-08 22:11:40.016519

(Provided photo.)The Department of Justice has been ordered to reinstate a Montana Highway Patrol trooper it fired last April after the officer shared a workplace climate survey with union staff.
The survey results showed low morale and other problems.
Former Trooper Alicia Bragg, union president at the time, provided a copy of the survey results to her field consultant and was subsequently fired last April.
“The evidence showed clearly that (Bragg) was getting multiple communications from MHP officers about the survey, its security and anonymity, as well as possible retaliation,” the decision said. “This is precisely the sort of communications that falls squarely within the union’s purview whether there are active negotiations ongoing or not.”
In the April 4, 2025 decision following arbitration hearings in December, the arbitrator found Bragg was wrongfully terminated and ordered the DOJ to reinstate her with full back pay and accrued benefits.
Arbitrator Jeffrey Jacobs said the union was correct in stating Bragg had rightfully acted within her role as local union president by communicating about a public survey with union staff.
“The inescapable conclusion is that (Bragg) was acting in her capacity as the union president when she sent the document to the union,” Jacobs said. “ … While the survey may have been somewhat embarrassing to the MHP, that alone did not render her action terminable.”
The decision said she is to be reinstated within 10 days, and it said there is no basis for any discipline “at all.”
“The state made much of (Bragg’s) comments that she would do this again and claimed that she showed no remorse,” the decision said. “Remorse is not the issue here. She acted within her scope as the union president.”
Tuesday, Bragg said she cried tears of joy and relief when she received a call the same morning with news the union had won her case.
She said the result made her feel supported, and it comes just days before the anniversary of the day she was fired, April 19.
Bragg is currently employed by the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office.
“I’ve waited nearly a year for this response,” Bragg said.
Bragg had earlier said some troopers told her they feared retaliation for their responses to the workplace climate survey, and the results reflected a lack of support for employees.
In firing Bragg, the Montana Highway Patrol argued members of a small committee that had received the survey had been ordered not to distribute it, and she disobeyed an order.
The arbitrator, though, found she acted correctly in the scope of her role with the union.
“It was clear though from her record that this directive was very different from one that she might receive in her role as a trooper,” the decision said. “There is no evidence that (Bragg) would disobey an order regarding her operational functions in the field.”
In April 2024, the Montana Federation of Public Employees filed an unfair labor practice complaint, alleging wrongful termination and retaliation by the Department of Justice and its Montana Highway Patrol division on behalf of Bragg.
In May, the Montana Federation of Public Employees filed a grievance against the Department of Justice. The grievance landed in arbitration after the DOJ denied it had merit.
In a statement, Bragg said she was terminated for doing her job “as a trooper who loves serving my state and as a union president who’s fiercely loyal to my fellow law enforcement officers.”
“Senior leaders at MHP and DOJ tried to sanitize and slow roll a public workplace climate survey that reflected poorly on their leadership, and I stood up for troopers,” Bragg said in a statement.
Bragg, who had worked at the highway patrol for a decade, said she couldn’t comment on whether she would be interested in reinstatement.
However, she said she is working with the union on figuring out restoration of back pay.
A spokesperson for the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
The MFPE said the arbitrator’s decision reflects the Montana Constitution’s protections for the public’s right to know.
“DOJ cannot withhold or obfuscate information about the public safety services Montanans fund and rely on every day,” MFPE said.
It also said the decision upholds legal protections surrounding activities that Montana union members have fought for and continue to defend.
“I am pleased but not surprised to find the law is in fact on our side,” said MFPE President Amanda Curtis in a statement. “No employer can target or punish a union member for doing union work, and union work includes uplifting and improving our professions. Trooper Bragg’s fellow union members are proud of her leadership and service.”
The climate results included biting criticisms of the Montana Attorney General’s Office.
Participants in the survey alleged Attorney General Austin Knudsen was micromanaging the MHP, failing to communicate, and its human resources department had an outsized and negative influence on the division.
Former employees earlier told the Daily Montanan the AG’s Office tried to keep the survey results under wraps, and Knudsen became upset when he learned a media outlet had filed a records request for it.
The Daily Montanan published a story about the results in March 2024.
However, the decision from the arbitrator said it was clear that Bragg did not send the document to the press, “nor did she direct anyone at the union to do so.”
Tuesday, Bragg said she believes the climate has gotten worse at the highway patrol since the climate survey, and she knows of several officers who have left since.
“Some of my oldest friends with the highway patrol have left and taken jobs either outside of law enforcement, or in law enforcement in a different jurisdiction now, just because the working conditions haven’t improved. The morale hasn’t improved,” she said.
“They still are waiting for management to show them a reason to stay.”
The Department of Justice did not respond to a question sent late Tuesday afternoon about whether the climate had improved since the survey last year.
Bragg, though, said she feels like her termination damaged the relationship between the federation and the highway patrol, and she doesn’t believe troopers are coming forward with concerns having seen the agency fire a union president.
She said the decision the Montana Highway Patrol made to fire her forced her to change her lifestyle, and it brought her character into question.
“There hasn’t been a day that has passed this past year that I haven’t thought about the decision that they made that changed the trajectory of my life and the trajectory of my career,” Bragg said.
She said the outcome backs her decision to stand up for troopers, and she said she hopes the agency can learn to work well with troopers and union members.
“It’s important for DOJ and MHP leadership to recognize and value their team by addressing the hard truths and choices openly,” Bragg said.
Collaborating with union members can lead to meaningful improvements in both working conditions and public safety, she said.
“Embracing challenges with transparency can foster a more positive and productive environment for everyone involved and will greatly improve morale and retention,” Bragg said.
In June 2024, an investigator found “probable merit” exists to support the allegation the DOJ committed an unfair labor practice, but the complaint had been on hold at the Department of Labor and Industry pending the outcome of the grievance.
An MFPE spokesperson said the union asked Tuesday to resume that process.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BRAGG.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 20:59:30.019493

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Another criminal prosecution against a former South Dakota state employee moved toward resolution Tuesday when a Springfield woman pleaded guilty to forging and falsifying food-service inspection reports.
Renee Lynn Strong, 55, entered the plea in Hughes County Circuit Court. She will be sentenced June 10 for two felony counts of forgery and two felony counts of offering false or forged instruments for filing or recording in a public office.
Each forgery count carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Each count of the other charge carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $4,000 fine.
‘Don’t do that’: Attorney general says guilty verdict in state theft trial sends a message

Strong was an employee of the South Dakota Department of Public Safety and was performing contract work for the Department of Health when the crimes occurred.
South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation investigated the case, and Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office is prosecuting it.
Strong’s plea came five days after a Hughes County jury convicted former state employee Lonna Carroll of two felony counts of grand theft for stealing $1.8 million over the course of 13 years from the Division of Child Protection Services. She is awaiting sentencing.
The Carroll and Strong cases are among five criminal prosecutions that Jackley has filed against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work with state government.
The run of allegations started in August, when Jackley said a deceased former three-decade employee of the state Department of Revenue, Sandra O’Day, had allegedly created 13 fake vehicle titles to help her secure $400,000 in loans. No charges were filed, because O’Day died before her alleged behavior came to light.
In October, Jackley announced charges against two other former Department of Revenue employees, Lynne Hunsley, 64, and Danielle Degenstein, 51, both of Pierre.
Hunsley has since pleaded guilty to forgery and grand theft by deception for creating a fake vehicle title that she used as proof of a trade-in to help her avoid excise taxes. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,200 in restitution to the state.
Degenstein is charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly concealing her knowledge of a crime committed by a person identified in court documents as “S.O.” — initials that match O’Day’s. Degenstein’s case file indicates she has reached a plea agreement and her June trial has been canceled.

In January, Amalia Escalante Barrientos, 28, of Brookings, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for using a grocery voucher intended for clients of the Department of Social Services. She was sentenced to pay a $400 fine, $96.50 in court costs and $449.98 in restitution. She’ll avoid serving 180 days in jail if she complies with the sentence.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor, strengthen the Board of Internal Controls, institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report, and establish protections for whistleblowers.

Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, attempted to pass similar legislation last year, but it did not get a vote in the House. Alabama is one of 20 states that tax period products, according to the Alliance for Period Supplies. 
“People shouldn’t have to choose between groceries and period products or groceries and baby formula,” Rinderkincht said.
URGE also advocated against SB 277, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, that centers sex education in Alabama on abstinence until marriage.

Patrick Morrisey closer to the finish line before the session is set to end on Saturday night. Senate Bill 474 — which passed the state Senate [&#8230;]","Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, speaks on the West Virginia House floor on April 3, 2025. On Tuesday, April 8, 2025, Flanigan spoke out in the House Judiciary Committee against a bill to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday advanced a bill to prohibit nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state, bringing a policy priority for Gov. Patrick Morrisey closer to the finish line before the session is set to end on Saturday night.
Senate Bill 474 — which passed the state Senate on March 26 and was advanced by the House Committee on Education last week — bans the offering of specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex.
The bill, as currently written, only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education. In response to Morrisey’s executive order, colleges and universities in West Virginia have already begun to review and dismantle services previously offered to students of different races, genders, sexual identities and more.
In Tuesday’s House Judiciary meeting, lawmakers voted down an amendment from the House Education committee that added “sex” in multiple places throughout the proposed code where the other identifiers (race, ethnicity, etc.) were already listed. Without that amendment, the bill does allow for certain services and “special benefits” to be offered to people based on their sex.
The bill also explicitly allows colleges applying for grants to issue statements in those applications that “highlight the institution’s work in supporting” first-generation college students, low-income students and “underserved” student populations. None of those terms are defined in the proposed code section. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are often offered to ensure all people — no matter their background or systemic factors that are known to exist and are proven to oppress them — are granted the same opportunities as other, often more privileged people.
The bill to prohibit DEI is a policy priority for Morrisey and is the legislative side of an executive order he issued earlier this year meant to do the same. It’s reflective of a trend spearheaded by Republicans nationwide meant to undermine and end DEI in all its forms. 
During discussion in committee on Tuesday, Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, joined Democratic Dels. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, and Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, in speaking against the passage of the bill. 
Flanigan said he thought SB 474 was “horrible” and worried that its mandate for teachers and professors to instruct contentious issues — like systemic racism, sexism and more — in a “neutral” and “colorblind” manner would do more harm than good.
People, often unconsciously, are operating under implicit biases that can hurt others who are afforded less privilege than them, Flanigan said. That behavior, he continued, leads to real harm and holds down  individuals by not allowing them to benefit from the same systems and opportunities others can.
“What we do to people without realizing it hurts and can harm. To say that we are ‘colorblind’ I think is incorrect; It’s not a proper way to be. You have to look at people’s color — it’s there. I think what we’re trying to do as a state is to say that we don’t need to accept these types of things, but it does happen. It’s there,” Flanigan said. “We can’t just randomly say we’re going to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion because somebody somewhere said, ‘Oh shoot, man, white people are losing right now.’  
“I know some of you are having a hard time even looking me in the eyes right now,” Flanigan continued. “… I don’t like this type of idea. It’s not bringing us forward in the country. I really think it’s holding us up.”
None of the individuals who voted in support for SB 474 in the committee spoke in favor of the bill before it passed via voice vote on Tuesday.
SB 474, if made law, will ban any state agency from running an office or division to promote diversity, equity or inclusion practices or from directing an employee to do the same. All current offices that do so are to be shut down.
It would also prohibit expressing any preferences for employment based on any metrics of diversity, equity or inclusion. No person hired can be required under the law to participate in diversity, equity and inclusion training and state agencies generally will not be allowed to run such training.
The bill would restrict how certain race- and gender-related topics are approached by teachers in schools, who will not be able to teach any lessons suggesting that someone’s race, ethnicity or sex makes them morally “superior” to someone else, among other things. The bill will also prevent teachers and school staff from being required to use a student’s preferred pronouns if those pronouns do not match the child’s sex.
The bill now advances to the full House for consideration and passage.

(Photo courtesy of Bathsheba Demuth)Later this spring, barges of heavy equipment will pull away from a launch on Alaska’s road system and begin a journey up the Yukon River.
More than 100 miles upstream, a tributary, Birch Creek, branches off.
The equipment’s destination is along that creek, on remote property owned by Alaska Native corporations in a huge basin called the Yukon Flats.
There, an oil company will set up a specially designed rig to drill the basin’s first-ever deep wells, which the landowners hope could lead to the discovery of the state’s next big oil field. 
If found, petroleum could create well-paying jobs for Yukon watershed residents and generate big dividend payments for the 20,500 shareholders of Doyon, the for-profit Native corporation for Alaska’s Interior region.
Doyon’s leaders describe the drilling effort as a rare opportunity — one that could deliver a lucrative resource sought from its lands for decades, though never produced.
But the campaign has engendered a broad backlash from tribal governments in the region.
Much of the opposition stems from the track record of the business that will be doing the drilling: Hilcorp, the large, privately held oil company founded by a Texas billionaire, Jeff Hildebrand.
Hilcorp has substantially increased its holdings in Alaska in recent years and now operates the massive Prudhoe Bay field on the state’s North Slope, where it partners with major firms like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.

	But it also has a history of leaks and accidents, prompting fears from Yukon watershed residents about the risks of its new drilling program.
“We’ve seen it so many times, that these big corporations come in and they take and take. They say they’re going to reinvest and it never happens,” said Rhonda Pitka, chief of the tribal government in Beaver, a Yukon River village some 20 miles downstream of the Birch Creek confluence. “What will we end up with at the end of all this?”
Whether the Yukon Flats will support commercial fossil fuel production remains highly uncertain, and likely won’t be known for years. More exploratory drilling will almost certainly be needed to better define a deposit even if Hilcorp finds evidence of petroleum this summer, and the infrastructure to extract and move it to market would require an array of environmental permits.
Even at this early stage, opponents are aggressively fighting the drilling plans. At a meeting last month, Interior Alaska’s consortium of 42 tribal governments, Tanana Chiefs Conference, approved a resolution against oil development by Hilcorp in the Yukon Flats, saying it’s too risky for the “ecologically and culturally significant region.”
But leaders of Birch Creek, the tiny Indigenous community closest to the drilling sites, have endorsed the effort, saying it could produce desperately needed jobs.
Birch Creek’s Native village corporation also owns some of the land where the drilling will take place, and like Doyon, it stands to benefit from a discovery.
“Without the economic activity this exploration project could create, Birch Creek and the other Yukon Flats villages may simply cease to exist, and our way of life will be lost forever,” the community’s tribal government said in a 2020 resolution endorsing the program. Birch Creek’s population is now just 30 people, and its school closed more than two decades ago because it had too few students, according to the state of Alaska.
The support from Birch Creek has given Doyon and Hilcorp the “social license to operate in that area,” Doyon’s chief executive, Aaron Schutt, said in an interview.
If oil is found, Doyon’s agreements with Hilcorp would require the company to hire shareholders and local residents, he added.

	Schutt said that Doyon’s early leaders, a half-century ago, chose to claim land in the Yukon Flats specifically because of its potential to yield oil and gas. 
“We can’t re-select. We can’t undo those deals that were done by our leaders 50 years ago,” he said. “We’re stuck with the hand we were dealt from 1972 to 1975. And we have to balance all of these various constituencies and opportunities and concerns, and do the best job that we can.”
Birch Creek leaders, through a Doyon official, declined to comment. Hilcorp released its own prepared statement saying it’s “excited to work with Doyon and community stakeholders to advance this meaningful exploration project in the Yukon Flats.” 
“Together, we are developing a tailored program to responsibly evaluate the region’s energy and resource potential,” said spokesman Matt Shuckerow.
A geologic enigma
The Yukon Flats basin covers more than 10,000 square miles, bounded by the Brooks Range mountains to the north and the White Mountains to the south. The Yukon River sweeps across from east to west, and the trans-Alaska pipeline snakes over the land from north to south.
The basin began forming at least 60 million years ago, according to Marwan Wartes, a veteran geologist with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. 
It’s still sinking today, making it difficult to study. Often, petroleum-rich regions of the state have experienced uplift, producing rocky outcroppings that give glimpses of their geologic histories — but those clues aren’t present in the flats, Wartes said. 
 

  A United States Geological Survey map of the Yukon Flats
 

	Experts suspect that the area contains sedimentary deposits that could produce natural gas, or even oil. But no one has drilled deep wells to confirm those theories, so the flats’ subsurface remains something of a geologic enigma.
“When I look at the whole map of Alaska, it always catches my eye, and I always am frustrated that we know so little about it — because it’s mostly burying itself,” Wartes said. “It is a mystery, and I think most geologists would agree to that.”
Today, the region, home to the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, is important habitat for as many as 2 million migratory ducks, as well as several species of fish. Its salmon and moose have long sustained the region’s Native people, who now live primarily in seven Indigenous villages within or near the refuge.
For nearly two centuries, the Yukon Flats have also been the source of global commodities — starting in the mid-1800s with furs, and continuing with the 1893 discovery of gold in Birch Creek.
The region has never produced oil; nearly all of Alaska’s petroleum comes from the other side of the Brooks Range, on the North Slope. 
But Doyon and oil companies have long eyed the flats for its potential, dating back to the years after the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. That federal legislation terminated Indigenous land claims in the state by transferring some 10% of Alaska’s land to newly formed, Native-owned corporations — which, with certain limitations, could choose the land that they wanted.
Doyon, owned by Alaska Natives with ties to the Interior region, became the state’s largest private landowner.
Working at the time with smaller Indigenous-owned corporations connected to the region’s villages, Schutt said, Doyon selected additional land in the Yukon Flats, hoping that it would yield petroleum. The idea was to capture areas with oil potential while also leaving room for the region’s residents to continue their subsistence-based lifestyles.

	Doyon formalized that strategy, Schutt said, in agreements with five village corporations. A 1974 agreement with Beaver’s Indigenous-owned corporation refers to the “potential for oil and gas” in the area around the village, “the development of which would benefit all of the shareholders of Doyon.”
Pitka, Beaver’s current tribal chief, said that oil was not the driving force behind the village’s participation in the Doyon agreement. 
“The village corporations picked land for subsistence,” Pitka said. “People were living on the land.”

	In the years after the land deals, major oil companies prospected for oil in the Yukon Flats; Exxon even signed an exploration agreement with Doyon. But Exxon pulled out of the region after its major 1989 oil spill near Valdez.
Studies continued, however.
Doyon contractors have collected hundreds of sediment and soil samples throughout the basin. The corporation has also conducted seismic testing, and it collaborated with federal and state agencies that drilled a research well to a moderate depth in 2004. The United States Geological Survey has estimated that the Yukon Flats contain 173 million barrels of oil, with a smaller chance of as much as 600 million barrels.
“This has been a basin that’s been on everyone’s radar as having potential for a long, long time,” said Wartes.
Hilcorp’s involvement began in 2019, when it signed an exploration agreement with Doyon covering some 2,500 square miles of the Native corporation’s land. 
Since then, Hilcorp has flown airborne surveys to gather geologic data, and it’s also drilled more than a dozen shallow test wells. Last year, it narrowed its focus, signing oil and gas leases with Doyon that cover 94 square miles near Birch Creek.
 

  Hilcorp shared this photo of one of its shallow test wells drilled in the Yukon Flats in 2021 in correspondence with state regulators.
 

	This kind of remote oil and gas exploration work, known as wildcatting, is not Hilcorp’s specialty; the company is better known for buying aging oil fields and making them more productive.
“They must see something that really captivates them, because there’s no shortage of oil on the North Slope,” said Phil Wight, an energy and environmental historian at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Even Schutt, the Doyon chief executive, said he’s not sure exactly what’s driving Hilcorp’s interest.
“I actually don’t know the answer to that,” he said. “It’s still kind of a mystery.”
A big upside for Doyon
This summer, Hilcorp plans to drill two exploration wells on separate sites.
The company has not publicly announced its plans, but some details have trickled into public view through documents submitted to the state. Hilcorp’s drilling effort requires an array of permits, among them a contingency plan that includes how the company would respond to a blowout.
The locations of the company’s two planned wells are 10 and 15 miles, respectively, from the Yukon River and the village of Birch Creek, according to the permitting documents. The sites will be supported by a worker camp staffed 24 hours a day.
The area is along a lower branch of Birch Creek and is accessible only by barge, helicopter or skiff, depending on water levels. Schutt said the work will leave a light footprint.
“If there’s no further development, those lands will be indistinguishable from the lands next door in 10 years,” he said.

	Opponents of the plan have focused their efforts on a pending Hilcorp request to state land managers to pump water from Birch Creek and a nearby lake for its drilling operation. 
The company says it will take a maximum of half of one cubic foot per second from the creek, which it describes as 0.05% of its flow. Ten different tribal groups have objected, according to their comment letters released by regulators in response to a Northern Journal public records request.
Allowing Hilcorp’s proposed withdrawal “would degrade water quality and jeopardize the ecological integrity of Birch Creek,” said one comment letter, from the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council. 
“We, the Indigenous Tribes and First Nations from the headwaters to the mouth of the Yukon River, urge the department to join us and put all of our future generations first,” the letter said.
If Hilcorp finds oil, the discovery would likely be just the start of more intense environmental battles to come.
Given the large cost of building a new oil field, construction would only make financial sense if it contained at least 200 million barrels of oil, according to Doyon’s estimates. Tying a development into the trans-Alaska pipeline would entail crossing federal land and require environmental permits that would face stiff opposition.
But for Doyon, the effort is worthwhile because of its big upside, according to Schutt. The company is already invested in the oil and gas industry; it owns a drilling subsidiary that maintains some of the largest rigs on the North Slope.
A new field in the Yukon Flats could produce a “massive royalty check” each year, much of which would be shared with Alaska’s other Native corporations under federal law, according Schutt. Doyon’s subsidiaries would be in line for contracts to work on the development, he added, and Yukon Flats villages likely could save money by tapping into newly available natural gas for heating. 
“It would economically support the whole subregion and Doyon for generations,” he said. “Those are the types of opportunities that don’t come along very often for us.”

Bob Ferguson has let House and Senate lawmakers know some of the concerns he has with the spending plans they’ve crafted.
A nine-page letter penned by his budget director reiterates Ferguson’s clarion call for maintaining strong reserves, restraining new spending and squeezing savings from state-funded programs before considering new revenue.
Budget writers said this week that the level of granular detail in the letter didn’t surprise them. But the absence of advice from the governor on where they could make a bigger dent in addressing a multibillion-dollar shortfall did.
“I would like direction from the governor and [Office of Financial Management] on where we can find additional reductions,” said Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair June Robinson, D-Everett, the architect of the Senate’s spending plan. “We’re in conversation about that.”
Ferguson’s April 4 missive identifies more than two dozen policies and programs of concern scattered through the 1,300-page spending blueprints of each chamber.

There are too few dollars to fight invasive pests like Japanese beetles and European green crabs. There are too many proposed closures of reentry centers for people exiting prison. Cuts in behavioral health and social service programs are too deep and funding must be locked in for the Washington State Patrol to replace its bomb squad equipment ahead of the 2026 World Cup.
No mention of the governor’s demand for $100 million for law enforcement hiring grants. No comments on the level of education funding, which Ferguson has said he wants to be a greater percentage of the general fund.
Such large policy items are already part of the budget discussions, Brionna Aho, communications director for Ferguson, wrote in an email.
“The intent of the concerns letter is to elevate things that haven’t been covered in those discussions, as well as offer technical feedback, raise implementation concerns and any policy concerns,” she wrote.
But for Robinson, a lawmaker at the center of trying to balance the state’s nearly $80 billion two-year budget, following the feedback in Ferguson’s letter would pose new complications.
“I’ll have to spend money,” she said.
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead budget writer for House Republicans, said the letter was a chance to flag the importance of some of the big items, and instead, the governor sent a mixed message.
“If budget writers essentially filled the litany of things he asked for, there would be a lot more spending,” he said. “To me, you can’t have your cake and eat it too.”
Couture said not every item highlighted in the letter is a bad idea. For example, he appreciated the governor’s asking for lawmakers to increase funding to fight invasive European green crabs that threaten commercial shellfish operations in his district.
But he disagrees with Ferguson’s desire to continue funding the Columbia River Gorge Commission. The House budget defunds the commission that was established in 1987 by the states of Oregon and Washington through the Columbia River Gorge Compact. Its role is overseeing policies and programs to protect the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.
This won’t be the last exchange between Ferguson and budget writers.
K.D. Chapman-See, Ferguson’s budget director, plans to submit  “a variety of specific policy and technical issues” to budget writers in the near future. 
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, who is the Republican leader on the Senate budget committee, said he wants to see if that document discusses the treatment of Ferguson priorities like school funding and the police hiring grants.
“I continue to appreciate and agree with his concerns regarding the importance of maintaining strong reserves,” Gildon said. “I also agree with the admonition that new spending be restrained.”
But the senator said he disagreed with the conclusion in the letter that meaningful reductions alone will not fully address the budget shortfall.
“It is clear that new taxes are not inevitable,” Gildon said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0785-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 20:05:20.552809

(Photo by Kevork Djansezian | Getty Images)Lawmakers in each chamber of the Montana Legislature have advanced bills that shift marijuana tax revenue, but preserve conservation funding.
A previous bill that would have stopped the flow of marijuana revenue to a group of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks programs, drawing opposition from many conservation groups, was tabled in a Senate committee on April 1. 
The two new bills each passed their respective house of origin with significantly more bipartisan support — Senate Bill 537 passed on Saturday 45-0, while House Bill 932 passed the same day 71-27. 
SB 537, introduced by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, keeps the existing amount of funding for conservation initiatives in place but expands how the funds can be used. The bill also increases distributions to the Healing and Ending Addiction through Recovery and Treatment (HEART) account, and adds funding for the Department of Justice, including substantial investments in law enforcement. 
“I would call this the Cops and Conservation Act,” Zolnikov said on the Senate floor on April 4. “Because one thing we hear about from my side of the aisle is we need more law enforcement, there’s more problems coming on, how do we help those guys. And I’ll tell you what was awesome about this bill, working with the other side of the aisle, they were very supportive of this side of the aisle’s priorities. Working with this side of the aisle, they seemed to be very comfortable clarifying the buckets on this side of the aisle’s priorities and helping on the conservation side. And in the end, we’re trying to fill gaps.”
Zolnikov’s bill emerged as a compromise piece of legislation following the pushback to Senate Bill 307, brought by Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, which would have shifted marijuana revenue from conservation to law enforcement. 
McGillvray said his bill gave lawmakers a choice, whether they thought people, who may be harmed by the effects of marijuana, or trails and wildlife were more important issues to fund. 
By contrast, Zolnikov sought to eliminate the choice and instead give all stakeholders a little bit of what they wanted by allocating the roughly $33 million of tax revenue that currently goes into the state’s general fund. 
Under the new structure, the current 4% revenue allocated each for state parks, trails and recreation and nongame wildlife remains as is. The 20% of funds currently earmarked for FWP’s Habitat Montana fund instead goes to a new Habitat Legacy Account, which Zolnikov said broadens the use of the funds. 
According to the bill, 75% of funds in the account must be used solely to fund wildlife habitat projects, while the rest may be used for various conservation-related projects including noxious weed programs, grants for conservation districts, big game and wildlife highway crossings, and land and water acquisitions or easement purchases. 
“It’s all types of buckets in there that the conservation folks worked on and supported,” Zolnikov said. “If you were in the hearing, it was the most fun group of people you could ever see all supporting it.”

The HEART fund, which currently receives a set $6 million of marijuana revenue, would be boosted to a 20% allocation, which will allow the account to grow with tax revenue. 
The other additions, which target needs identified by McGillvray such as boosting law enforcement include: 2.5% for DOJ canine training, 1.5% for DOJ sexual assault exams and kits, 0.25% for the Board of Crime Control to fund crisis intervention training; 14% to the behavioral health system for future generations funds; 6.5% for drug and alcohol use prevention and 31% for DOJ  law enforcement grants. 
Those grants would include distributing $50,000 to each police department, sheriff’s office and tribal police department, plus proportional distributions based on department size. 
“It’s a pretty thorough bill. I’d say, working on it, I had to learn about a lot of problems that I think there’s some gaps that we’re not filling, and this really helped fills them in the future,” Zolnikov said. 
McGillvray told reporters on Tuesday that he felt many of the things in Zolnikov’s bill, such as letting the HEART fund grow with tax revenue, were smart, but he still had some concerns about using the funds for conservation. 
“The nexus between marijuana revenue and marijuana harms is just smart tax policy. And unfortunately, it all got started on the wrong foot, and it was a tough sell to get it back on the right foot,” he said. 
McGillvray added that removing revenue from the state’s general fund for law enforcement is a “big bite that could have a struggle” with the governor’s office. 

On the House side, Rep. Ken Walsh, R-Twin Bridges, brought HB 932, which targets just the current 30% of conservation funding allocated to Habitat Montana.
It functions in roughly the same way as SB 537, moving those funds to a new Habitat Legacy Account. 
Under HB 932, that account would funnel 75% into a separate Land and Wildlife Stewardship account that would be used solely for habitat conservation projects, while the remaining funds would be split between wildlife crossings, and the Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program (WHIP) account. 
WHIP funds can currently only be used for noxious weed treatment, but Walsh’s bill would greatly expand their use. 
“What this bill will do is expand that bucket for private land owners, and conservation groups and fish, wildlife and parks to work together,” Walsh said
He listed off some possible applications — irrigation infrastructure, forest management, prescribed fire, fish passage, soil enhancement, and wetland protection. 
“Maybe even wildlife crossings, so we don’t hit as many elk and deer on the road,” he said. 
The bill drew some opposition for continuing to fund conservation-related programs. 
“This bill is going to lock up marijuana revenue in wildlife management kinds of things. And I know that’s important to this body. But we have been listening all session about what’s going on in our correctional system — we don’t have enough space, don’t have enough space,” Rep. Fiona Nave, R-Columbus, said. “That’s drug driven. We need the marijuana funding … to be available for drug treatment and law enforcement.”
But lawmakers overwhelmingly backed the bill under its expanded scope. 
“This allocated available dollars to important Montana industries, agriculture and the outdoor economy. It’s a good bill for these businesses,” said Rep. Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls.
HB 932 is awaiting a hearing before the Senate Fish and Game Committee while SB 537 will be heard in the House Taxation Committee later this month.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/weed.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 20:05:20.552809

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A plane ticket for a “romantic” partner and other “suspected improprieties” have turned the State Auditor’s spotlight on a small, publicly-funded nonprofit whose board is appointed by the governor and whose mission is to support Nebraskans with disabilities.
A new auditor probe of the Nebraska Statewide Independent Living Council points to alleged “malfeasance” by the former executive director, Don Dew — though Dew and the council’s former treasurer insist that the spending was board-approved.

Both have resigned, and assert that certain board members stirred trouble for Dew in part because he is gay.
The new board chairwoman dismissed that as nonsense and said State Auditor Mike Foley was summoned after Dew did not produce requested records to support spending. 
Both sides agree on at least one thing. They said the gubernatorial-led process by which the board’s appointments are made has been slow-going — and they believe an undersized governing board with too many unfilled slots contributed to problems.
Report goes to FBI, law enforcement
The board is authorized for 15 voting members and five non-voting members, which represent various state agencies and service providers, according to the auditor’s report. For several years, current and past members said, the organization has operated with two or three voting members and several non-voting members.
Currently, the council has two regularly voting board members “with a third that is used under certain circumstances,” and 10 nonvoting members mostly representing independent living organizations, said Jody Faltys, who returned to the board in late in 2024 and is now chair.
Phil Olsen, state accounting administrator under Gov. Jim Pillen, said the minimum requirement under law is three voting board members but that he foresees others being appointed soon. He said the council has seen turnover with members uneasy under Dew’s financial leadership.
 

What is NESILC?
Based in Lancaster County, the Nebraska Statewide Independent Living Council (NESILC) is funded primarily with federal dollars from the Independent Living Administration.
Established in 2001, the public benefit nonprofit corporation has a mission to, in partnership with the Independent Living Network, promote independence, inclusion, non-discrimination and dignity for all people with disabilities in Nebraska.
States are required to establish and maintain such independent and statewide councils, according to the auditor’s report, to be eligible for financial assistance authorized under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that was further amended under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014.
State leaders said a federal grant of about $340,000 is divided between the council and two Centers for Independent Living, which are the League of Human Dignity and Independence Rising.



Faltys said interest in joining the council board had waned, and she hopes that will improve.
“It’s all about checks and balances, and what we need is to get those guard rails as strong as they can be to make us as strong as we can be,” Faltys said. 
The Statewide Independent Living Council, with an annual budget of about $115,000, is a small but vital organization whose existence is required by law to unlock federal funds that help Nebraskans with disabilities live independently. 
It came under auditor scrutiny after board members reported possible financial improprieties. Findings are laid out in a 25-page report, which included recommendations to improve internal controls. The report was made public last week and addressed to Faltys. 
Any further investigation lies with the FBI, Lancaster County Attorney and Nebraska Attorney General, which got copies of the report from Foley’s office.
Plane ticket questioned
Foley, in a statement, focused on $9,466 in what his team called “suspected improprieties” by Dew over a three-year period: $2,043 in alleged excess pay to himself; $6,750 in health insurance reimbursements that lacked documentation, and a $672 plane ticket for his partner to a work-related conference.











While better late than never, some of this could have been avoided had the NESILC board taken its oversight responsibilities more seriously from the start.


– State Auditor Mike Foley



“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I can’t emphasize this enough: Allowing someone to exercise anything close to exclusive control over an organization’s finances with no meaningful oversight is begging for serious trouble,” Foley wrote. 
He said the audit team noted the council’s lack of policies and procedures for safeguarding funds and said leaders appear to be taking corrective measures. 
Olsen said he, representing the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, took over in 2024 as the designated state conduit responsible for receiving and disbursing funds to the council from the federal government. He said he raised a red flag after he started attending the council’s quarterly meetings and noticed a lack of bank statements, credit card and expense approvals.
Faltys saw the audit as confirming  “what we saw.”
Said Foley: “While better late than never, some of this could have been avoided had the NESILC board taken its oversight responsibilities more seriously from the start.”
COVID-19 was turning point
In a response included in the auditor’s report, the council recapped what led to this point. Its current leader said a COVID-19-related shutdown led to heavy change in the organization — as its only executive director up to that point retired.

Dew, a former board chair, then was hired and held the position three years until his resignation effective at the close of 2024. The audit said his salary was $26,168.
The council wrote that Dew “didn’t live up to the high standards” set by his predecessor.
“With board members leaving, with policies and procedures not being applied rigorously, it soon became clear that the future of NESILC was a turning point,” stated the council. 
The council wrote that it was disappointed in its own lack of oversight and was “wiping the slate clean and refocusing on our mission.”
Clearing name 
Dew, with a completely different take, was angry at the allegations. He said the auditor’s team didn’t ask him for his version of what happened. 
He said he had filed his own complaint with the Nebraska Attorney General after a board member removed what he said were confidential files from a storage area. 
Dew said he is working with an attorney and considering legal action as he feels his name should be cleared.
“Everything had been approved,” he told the Nebraska Examiner, calling the probe incomplete. “It’s in a budget or through an executive committee meeting, so there’s no way that they can say I did (anything) without approval.”
Deanna Henke, treasurer of the council’s board during much of the alleged misuse of funds, backed Dew.
She said the board approved the airline ticket in the spring of 2024 for Dew’s partner who, she and Dew said, served as a personal attendant. Dew said he has epilepsy, controlled by medication, and other disabilities. At the time of the conference, Dew said he was suffering from several broken ribs.











It was not a sightseeing trip. He wasn’t gallivanting around town in Little Rock, Arkansas.


– Deanna Henke, former treasurer of the NESILC



Henke said Dew was mandated to attend the work conference, which she said he helped lead. “If they require a personal attendant due to their disability, then we pay … not only for Don to go, but for his assistant.” 
She said “it’s been that way for years,” and added “it was not a sightseeing trip. He wasn’t gallivanting around town in Little Rock, Arkansas.”
‘Target on his back’
According to Foley’s press release, council representatives informed the audit team that the ticket was for a man with whom Dew had romantic and business relationships. The representatives said the man is “neither an employee nor in any way affiliated with the organization.”
Said Henke: “Don being a gay man, they’ve had a target on his back ever since he became executive director.”
Faltys said she saw no pre-approval records and called the ticket the “final straw that broke the camel’s back.” She added, “There were no receipts. There were no minutes for meetings.”

Noted in the audit were 98 “questionable” credit card transactions, besides the airline ticket, that totaled about $8,400, including for a Dropbox account, business vendors and Jimmy John’s restaurant. The report said Dew controlled the card.
“Board members were not aware of, nor did they approve, most of these payments,” the auditing team said.
In addition, the auditing team said it could not locate adequate documentation to substantiate board approval of 17 payments totaling $47,580 over three years for apparent reimbursements or other payments unrelated to wages, including health insurance stipends, retirement contributions and bonuses.
‘Look at facts’ 
Deputy State Auditor Craig Kubicek said in an interview that the team didn’t speak directly to Dew, but its findings were based on records available at the time.
“We look at facts, we look at documentation, we look at compliance,” Kubicek said.
He said Dew concurrently served as executive director of a separate organization in Iowa also dedicated to people with disabilities, and that Dew declined the Nebraska auditor team access to the Iowa payroll records. Based on that, Kubicek said his team figured it would get nowhere if it asked Dew for input on the Nebraska review, so it didn’t.
Meanwhile, Faltys said she is effectively acting also as executive director and pushing to add more voting board members. 
Herself a quadriplegic, she said the organization is more important than most understand. It works with state partners to develop Nebraska’s three-year plan for independent living and community based services. It supports research, education and reforms related to disability issues.
Without it, advocates said, certain federal funding could not flow to groups such as the League of Human Dignity and Independence Rising. Faltys said the availability of the services and accountability of the organization should matter to all. 
“Everyone is a moment away from being disabled,” Faltys said. “You could have a stroke, a car accident, these are issues vital to everyone.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)An Iowa ag company accused of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme is being sued by a lender that says 110,000 piglets in South Dakota are at risk of starvation.
Compeer Financial of Minnesota is suing Sunterra Farms Iowa Inc., Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. in U.S. District Court. Compeer alleges that the three defendants operate extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, and have granted Compeer, their lender, exclusive security over their collective assets.
Compeer is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take control of the defendants’ assets so that Compeer can protect its collateral by continuing to provide for the feeding and care of 110,000 head of swine.
The defendant companies are allegedly operated by the Price family of South Dakota, including Ray, Art and Glen Price, who own and manage 110,000 head of swine in 54 barns located in and around Yankton County, South Dakota. The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra.

Compeer claims in the lawsuit that because of what it calls “the long-running fraud” perpetrated by the defendant companies, they cannot be trusted to operate their businesses and protect their assets, including the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County.
According to the lawsuit, the three defendant companies have engaged in check kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer’s lawsuit claims that earlier this year, the defendant companies were issuing each other numerous checks, in nearly identical amounts, on a daily basis — with some checks ranging from $800,000 to $990,000, an amount just below the threshold that would trigger scrutiny from regulators.
The transactions had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest, the lawsuit claims.
Compeer alleges that on Feb. 12, 2025, the day after it asked Ray Price, the CEO of the defendant companies, about the transactions, it received a batch of checks totaling $9 million drawn one of the defendants’ Canadian bank accounts for deposit into the defendants’ account with Compeer.
Later that day, the lawsuit claims, Ray Price admitted that the checks were intended only to prevent the Compeer account from being overdrawn, and acknowledged that if Compeer attempted to deposit the $9 million it would trigger a corresponding overdraft in the Canadian account. According to the lawsuit, Price admitted that what the companies were doing was “wrong.”
About 24 hours later, the lawsuit claims, Price spoke to Compeer personnel and said the Canadian account was overdrawn by roughly $21 million, adding that he needed Compeer to immediately “send the money back” to the Canadian bank to cover the overdraft. Compeer refused.
In late February, the lawsuit alleges, Compeer learned the Canadian bank had rejected 65 checks totaling $59.9 million previously credited by Compeer to the defendants’ accounts. As a result, the defendants’ $21 million positive cash balance at Compeer was instantly wiped out and replaced with a $36 million debt owed by the defendants to Compeer.
In its lawsuit, Compeer alleges that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions.
Court records show that on March 17, 2025, the Canadian bank asked that a receiver be appointed to look after the defendants’ assets. However, the listed assets in that case didn’t include the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County, or the 370,000 head owned by third parties and managed by Sunterra.
In court filings, Compeer says that over the past several weeks, it has provided funds necessary for the care and feeding of the Yankton County pigs, but says it is no longer willing to do so “while the parties who perpetrated this fraudulent scheme” remain in control of Sunterra, Sunwold and Lariagra.
“These swine are in imminent danger of starvation if feed is not promptly purchased and delivered to barns housing the pigs,” the lawsuit states, adding that workers hired to provide for the animals’ care may soon walk off the job given the Price family’s inability to make payroll.
If court appoints a receiver, Compeer states in its court filings, it will advance the money necessary to protect its collateral and prevent the animals’ starvation.
The Price family has not yet responded to the lawsuit and Sunserra declined comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for fraud and unjust enrichment. The lawsuit was initially filed in South Dakota state court before being transferred to federal court.

Health agencies scramble as North Dakota loses federal grants

North Dakota has 10 projects that were authorized for the federal funding but those dollars will be rescinded, the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday. Additional projects are going through a re-review process and could potentially lose funding as well.
In an April 4 statement, a FEMA spokesperson said: “The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.”
In Wells County, the grant was going to help prevent erosion in Fessenden’s lagoon, which is over 100 years old.
“We were going to open bids May 1,” Roehrich said. “We were shovel ready.”
Planning for the project began in 2020 and the county was awaiting the final grant paperwork from FEMA after the agency toured the project site in June 2024.
Funding the project locally would require increasing property taxes by $6,000 on each Wells County homeowner, Roehrich said.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has directed state agencies to work with local communities to explore other funding solutions, according to a Tuesday news release.
Other funding options for Fessenden could include a $1 million loan the community could pay back over 30 years, Roehrich said. 
“For every dollar of mitigation spent in North Dakota, we’re saving six to seven dollars,” Roehrich said. “It’s a huge savings so the cost-benefit is there.”
Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, said FEMA was dragging its feet on finalizing the Fessenden grant award and now it feels like the rug was pulled out from under them. He added additional service fees were added to the utility bills of local residents in recent months to help with the project.
“I’ve been out to the lagoon. I know it’s in dire need,” Klein said. “It’s unfortunate. Some of these projects, there was a promise and now that promise is being kind of like, ‘Here it is, but we really didn’t mean it.’”
Klein said it will be hard for the state to fill the funding gaps left by the loss of federal grants.
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said  lawmakers would be able to look into funding options while the Legislature is still in session, but they can’t plan for cuts that haven’t happened yet, or haven’t come to light.
“Anything that comes now that is going to impact appropriations that are necessary for public safety, we’ll obviously look at that,” Bekkedahl said. “I can’t guarantee that it’ll be funded and I can’t guarantee where we’ll find the funding because we’re still overspent at this point, but I think as long as we’re here, we’ll have those discussions.”
Bekkedahl said local subdivisions should contact the governor’s office to make sure their federal funding losses are cataloged.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Organizations devoted to helping immigrants; crime victims; and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault in New Mexico are asking Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to enact a privacy law they say would restore trust in public data systems that handle sensitive personal information.
Senate Bill 36 would prohibit, for instance, state Motor Vehicle Division employees from disclosing driver’s license data to any entity that would use it to enforce federal civil immigration laws. That includes requiring private companies that buy MVD data to certify they won’t use the data in service of deporting immigrants who aren’t accused of crimes.
When immigrant New Mexicans apply for their driver’s licenses, they must  disclose their photos, addresses and other identifying information, said SB36 co-sponsor Rep. Christina Parajón (D-Albuquerque) during debate in the House of Representatives on March 18.
Doing so makes them part of “one of the most useful data systems available currently to law enforcement, and we want to ensure that everyone continues to use this data system,” Parajón said.
Leaders of 21 different domestic violence, sexual assault and crime victim service organizations in New Mexico signed a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday urging her to sign SB36 into law. They wrote that the bill is “critical to advancing public safety, protecting survivor privacy and maintaining trust in the systems survivors must rely on to find safety and healing.”
The letter comes as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security agree to share tax information of immigrants who have final orders of removal to help immigration agents find and deport the immigrants.
The bill also would also create a uniform policy for all state agencies and their employees that would limit the intentional disclosure of someone’s sensitive information like sexual orientation or their status as a crime victim.
The letter states that survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault often take great personal risk in seeking help, and a foundational part of helping them is ensuring that their personal, sensitive information remains confidential. Survivors depend on access to state-issued identification, driver’s licenses and essential services to maintain their independence, the letter states.
“When systems share or use survivor data without their informed consent, it jeopardizes not only their safety but also the safety of our communities,” the letter states. “Without clear protections for their personal data, these lifelines become sources of danger. SB36 ensures that state systems do not become another failed link in the safety net.”
The groups published the letter in a news release on Tuesday morning, after the governor’s office announced late Monday that she signed a list of five dozen bills from which SB36 was absent.
A spokesperson for Lujan Grisham told Source NM on Tuesday the governor’s office received the letter and staff was reviewing it.
“The Legislative Session represents a cornerstone of our democratic process, and we deeply value every New Mexican’s voice and participation,” Deputy Director of Communications Jodi McGinnis Porter said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the letter, SB36 would remove  barriers that prevent survivors from reporting abuse, seeking restraining orders or engaging with the criminal legal system.
New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic Violence Executive Director Mary Ellen Garcia, who signed the letter, told Source NM in an interview on Tuesday that under the current law, someone can ask for the information directly from MVD, or find it in databases run by companies that have purchased the data from MVD.
Garcia said acquiring state-issued identification cards improves safety for survivors, because they need ID to access a protection order from a court, for example. A survivor trying to protect themselves doesn’t want their perpetrator to find their information just because they handed it to MVD in order to get an ID, she said.
“As New Mexicans, we want to ensure that the systems we use don’t also have us thinking about how they are going to be used against us,” Garcia said.
Another person who signed the letter, Enlace Comunitario Executive Director Sara Yvonne “Bonnie” Escobar, said in a statement that by signing SB36 into law, Lujan Grisham “would be taking an important step in ensuring that all New Mexicans—including vulnerable immigrant communities — are protected.”
Escobar’s organization serves Latine and immigrant domestic violence survivors.
“SB36 ensures that all New Mexicans can access essential services with confidence, knowing their sensitive data is protected,” Escobar said.
Marcela Díaz, founding executive director of Somos un Pueblo Unido, told Source NM in a phone interview on Tuesday that SB36 would replace the existing “patchwork” of privacy and confidentiality policies in New Mexico. For example, the cities of Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Cruces already have local policies preventing their employees from sharing sensitive personal information, she said.
“There are so many different kinds of services that victims need to access to support their families and their communities,” Díaz said. “They just want to know that their most vulnerable information will be protected, and this will give them peace of mind.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed four bills into law Tuesday, April 8, relating to water and PFAS. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday signed into law four bills she said better prepares New Mexico to address: water shortages from climate change; contamination from so-called “forever chemicals;” and pollution in the state’s waters.
At a press conference at the Roundhouse joined by sponsors, advocates and several cabinet secretaries, the governor signed:

House Bill 137, which will explore treatment of salty water from deep aquifers for future use.
House Bill 212, which tasks state environment officials to create rules phasing out consumer products containing a class of toxic so-called “forever chemicals,” called per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS.
House Bill 140 to expand New Mexico Environment Department’s authority to require the cleanup of firefighting foams containing PFAS in response to litigation from the U.S. military over cleanup at military bases in New Mexico.
Senate Bill 21, a bill to expand New Mexico’s powers to address stream pollution and take over pollution permitting in surface waters from the federal government.

“When you talk about water to anyone, it’s typically not a dialogue, it’s a debate, because water is life,” Lujan Grisham said during the bill signing, adding that the Legislature and her office “did about three decades worth of work” on the issue over the session.
New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney called the four bills “a big, bold package,” for the environment.
“This is a real turning point, I think, for taking back control of our water, of what consumer products are coming into our homes, of teaching people how to treat New Mexico and its environment,” Kenney said.
Lujan Grisham also celebrated the passage of HB137, the much pared down Strategic Water Supply, crediting state Rep. Susan Herrera (D-Embudo) for sponsoring the bill. HB137 addresses aquifer mapping and treatment of brackish water in deep aquifers, and funding for mapping the state’s groundwater supplies.
Previous and more controversial versions of the bill included efforts to treat oil and gas wastewater, which environmental, Indigenous and conservation nonprofits opposed due to potential health and logistical risks. A previous version of the bill also installed fees for oil and gas producers per barrel of oil and gas wastewater to help pay for the program, but those also were stripped from the bill.
“This is a monumental stake in identifying water and keeping our fresh water fresh and clean and making sure that we can do both economic development and create assurances for any number of industries, including ag in the future,” Lujan Grisham said of the bill, and noted she plans to push for developing treatment for oil and gas wastewater in next year’s 30-day session.
“I think we should clean up every bit of contaminated water, wherever it exists, from uranium mill tailings to produced water, all of it,” Lujan Grisham said, adding that the costs should be paid for by the oil and gas industry.
The governor also applauded the Legislature’s work in passing SB21, a bill to enshrine the state’s right to regulate pollution in surface waters like streams and rivers and continue the yearslong process to develop a state program for permits. New Mexico was one of only three states that allowed the federal government to handle all pollution permitting in surface waters.
SB21 allows the state to reinstate protections for more than 90% of New Mexico’s waters which were stripped by the Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA.
Paula Garcia, the executive director of the New Mexico Acequia Association, told Source NM the laws will reinstall meaningful protections for the tributary waters on which irrigators rely, but that the organization will ensure there’s follow-through in the yearslong process for the state to take over permitting.
“We have to stay vigilant to ensure the state’s environment department has the resources that the need to stand up this program,” Garcia said.
It was a much warmer mood on the fourth floor, compared to the somber end of the legislative session, which occurred in the aftermath of the Las Cruces mass shooting on March 21 and prompted criticism from the governor on legislative inaction regarding juvenile crime reform.
Lujan Grisham said on Tuesday a special session on juvenile crime is still under discussion, but a specific date has not been set. She said perhaps later this year after interim committee meetings begin.
“I’m still feeling like that’s really necessary,” she said.
In the upcoming 30-day session, the governor said she’d fight for a law codifying greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2050, which she issued as an executive order in 2019. This year’s version, Senate Bill 4, sponsored by Senate Pro Tem Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), failed to advance beyond Senate Finance this year.
She emphasized that her administration is running out of time.
“It’s the last chance, and people should expect me to have a little bit better than a scalpel approach, a little bit less than a sledgehammer about where we’re going in climate change,” Lujan Grisham said.

Lucke joins Lantern freelancers Deborah Yetter, Tom Loftus and Jack Brammer, television trailblazer Barbara Bailey, Pulitzer Prize administrator Dana Canedy and many others in the high distinction. 
In an acceptance speech in the Gatton Student Center on the University of Kentucky’s campus, Lucke spoke to the importance of journalism now and in the future. 
“So much is on the line, including that thing that’s at the very top of the rights of citizens,” Lucke said. “And that is an independent, free press.” 
She also said nonprofit journalism, such as the Kentucky Lantern and its parent, States Newsroom, are imperative to the future of journalism. This organization, she said, is “one reason I’m hopeful.” 
“The number one essential ingredient in a democracy, as written in the highest law in our land, is an informed citizenry,” Lucke said. “An independent, free press may have never been as imperiled as it is right now. It’s also never been as needed.”

During Tuesday’s ceremony, Duane Bonifer, the president of the UK Alumni Association, praised the inductees for their “relentless quest for truth, fairness and fidelity to high moral and ethical ideals.” 
“They believe that no matter how fierce the political winds of the moment might glow, there are certain timeless principles and values that the free people should not abandon, principles and values such as honesty and openness, the freedom of inquiry and speech, the pursuit of knowledge and the respect of facts and the rule of law and the belief that when organizations embrace inclusion, diversity and equity and don’t flee from them…they are extending opportunities and welcoming all people into our larger society.” 
Before States Newsroom, the Lantern’s parent nonprofit, chose Lucke to launch the Kentucky Lantern in 2022, she was a longtime reporter and editorial writer for the Lexington Herald-Leader. 
Lucke attended the University of Kentucky and graduated from the School of Journalism in 1976. 
Lucke is part of this year’s class of five, including Kentucky Educational Television’s Renee Shaw, longtime Courier Journal reporter Stephen J. Ford, University of Kentucky Television/Radio Network host and announcer Dick Gabriel and Lexington Herald-Leader photojournalist Ron Garrison.
The University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni Association founded the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 1980 and inducts members every year. Those in the Hall must be “natives of Kentucky or journalists who have spent a significant portion of their careers in Kentucky,” according to the College of Communication.

Josh Shapiro and Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding speak to reporters after addressing members of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Warning new tariffs threaten an “economic calamity,” Gov. Josh Shapiro pledged to protect Pennsylvania farmers, who were hit hard during President Donald Trump’s first term when U.S. trading partners placed retaliatory duties on agricultural exports.
Shapiro highlighted his administration’s investments in agriculture as part of a statewide economic development plan in remarks to members of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. Farms and associated businesses employ 600,000 people and contribute $132 billion to the commonwealth’s economy each year, Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding noted before the speech.
While the state Department of Agriculture has helped farmers weather highly contagious avian influenza that decimated chicken flocks and threatened dairy herds, the Trump administration’s tariffs have brought greater uncertainty and peril, Shapiro said. 
“I’m not sure why the Trump administration is looking to screw over our farmers,” Shapiro told reporters after his speech. “We have their backs, and we’re going to protect them.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump on April 2 announced broad tariffs on imports from other nations, triggering stock sell-offs around the world as investors responded to uncertainty over how businesses would respond. 
The tariffs make it more expensive for U.S. businesses to import products and materials from other countries. They’re based on the difference between the value of goods exported to and imported from another country and range from 10% to 104% on Chinese imports as officials there vowed to “fight to the end.”
“For all of the talk about bringing companies and industries back to the United States, our farmers are already here,” Shapiro said. “They’re already doing business in this commonwealth and in this country, and I believe they are being unnecessarily hurt by these trade wars.”
As other countries consider and impose reciprocal tariffs, Pennsylvania farm products become more expensive for buyers abroad, eroding hard-won markets and decreasing sales, Shapiro said.
“Understand, this is not theoretical and this is not some political statement. This is the reality, and you’ve already lived through it,” Shapiro said, recalling that in 2018 Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel prompted retaliatory duties on U.S. agricultural exports causing lost income for farmers.
“The first Trump administration was forced to make $27 billion in payments for lost income to farmers in Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” Shapiro said “All of the tariffs that were raised back then went to paying farmers for lost market share.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that Pennsylvania agricultural exports decreased by about $66 million in 2018 and 2019.

And such losses are not easily recouped, Shapiro said, noting that Pennsylvania is the top exporter of hardwood products. But since 2017, U.S. production of hardwood lumber decreased 50% as a result of turmoil created by retaliatory tariffs, he said.
“That means fewer jobs in the hardwood industry here at home in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
Pennsylvania’s dairy industry could also be affected by retaliatory tariffs by Mexico, where commonwealth  farmers sell $170 million in dairy products each year.
Shapiro also addressed a planned $25 million reduction in funding for the state’s bird flu recovery fund. It’s reimbursed farmers $13 million for the cost of responding to outbreaks, leaving $61 million in reserve, which he said is “more than enough to meet the needs of our poultry farmers and see them through this crisis.”
“Should we need more, you have my word, I will be there to make sure our poultry farmers have what they need to get back up on their feet again,” Shapiro said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3859-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 20:05:20.552809

Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, speaks on the House Floor during a meeting of the Legislative Management Committee on Nov. 13, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill to establish public charter schools in North Dakota passed the House on a 64-29 vote Tuesday.
Senate Bill 2241 would allow the establishment of public charter schools in North Dakota. These schools would be under the same regulations as public schools, but operate outside the school district and be administered by their own internal governing boards, once established.
“It’s so exciting to think about the potential of what this could do in North Dakota,” said Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, chief sponsor of the bill.
The charter schools would not be able to charge tuition or teach religious curriculum. The schools would need to come to a performance agreement with the Department of Public Instruction and meet or exceed academic and graduation benchmarks set by the department. 
The schools would receive state funding, about $8,160 per student for 2024-25, and could receive federal grants or donations. Charter schools would not be allowed to use the state’s school building fund.
  Rep. Larry Klemin, R-Bismarck, speaks on the House floor on Feb. 25, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Rep. Larry Klemin, R-Bismarck, voted against the bill and raised concerns that the per pupil payments to charter schools could be used for its construction and building maintenance. 
“In a sense, we’re going to be supporting public schools and charter schools through the payment of our taxes,” Klemin said.
Others said it would divert money from public schools and create funding problems around the state, especially in rural areas with fewer students.
“We have one pie and the state slices that pie for the different programs,” said Rep. Donald Longmuir, R-Stanley. “And if they slice a piece of that pie away to public charters, that takes away from the public schools.”
He added no one from his district has sent him any messages that they need a public charter school. Longmuir voted against the bill.
Axtman said she thinks rural communities could benefit from public charter schools because some rural schools at risk of closing could reorganize as a public charter.
She also stressed that charter schools will only go to communities that want them.
“If a rural community doesn’t have the support or the need for a charter school, it simply won’t open there,” Axtman said.
The overall fiscal impact of the bill is unclear. If students from traditional public K-12 schools switch to charter schools, the state would spend less to educate those students in per pupil payments. However, if private school or homeschool students begin attending public charter schools, the cost to the state would increase.
Senate Bill 2241 was approved by the Senate in February on a 40-7 vote.
The bill will now travel back to the Senate to concur with the House’s amended bill. If approved, it will go to the governor’s desk for his signature.
