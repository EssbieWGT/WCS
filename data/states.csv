(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz regaled about a thousand people at a South Dakota Democratic Party fundraiser Saturday night with jabs at the state’s former and current governors, advice for winning back rural voters and blue collar workers, and pride in liberal ideals.
The 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee — who was on the losing ticket with presidential nominee Kamala Harris — delivered the keynote speech to a sellout crowd at the 2025 McGovern Day dinner at the Sioux Falls Convention Center. Reporters were allowed into the event, but not to take photographs once it started.
It didn’t take long for Walz to criticize the actions of U.S. Homeland Security secretary and Republican former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. 
“If you had to pick somebody who’s the antithesis of the South Dakota I know, it would be that,” he said.

The two served in Congress, cosponsoring bills together before 2018, when each was elected to lead their respective states.
Their relationship soured during the COVID-19 pandemic when they took divergent approaches, and further deteriorated when Noem described Walz as a “radical” in her role as a Trump surrogate during last year’s presidential campaign.
Walz, speaking of his preparation to appear in South Dakota, said “I had to decide what I was going to wear.”
“When you’re a governor and you’re in South Dakota, do you dress as a fireman? You dress as a cowgirl?” he said.
The joke was a dig at Noem. She donned firefighting gear at a U.S. Coast Guard training facility, for example, and wore a cowboy hat for an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“I know it’s petty, but some people just bring out the petty,” Walz said.
Advice for SD Democrats
He laid out his connections to South Dakota once the laughter died down. He grew up nearby in Nebraska. He hunted pheasants in Winner, saw drive-in movies in Lake Andes and “spent too much time” at a bar called the Longbranch in Burke.
Walz also prodded current South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, who recently signed a bill that will allow the concealed carry of pistols on college campuses by gun owners with enhanced permits. Walz described that as one of the Republican talking points about South Dakota being “the freest state in the nation.”

“I think some of you may have a difference of opinion in that. I ran into an OB-GYN that says that’s not true,” Walz said, referencing South Dakota’s near-total abortion ban.
Walz told Democrats that Republicans who paint them as “elites” are cutting taxes for the wealthy and reducing support for student aid programs and Medicaid while “tearing apart” rural communities and mass-detaining undocumented immigrants.
“Is our immigration system broken? Yes. But our moral system sure as hell should not be with throwing people in camps,” he said, a reference to a detention center for migrants in the Florida Everglades that President Trump calls “Alligator Alcatraz.”
“The people building prison camps are never the good guys in history,” Walz said.
He urged Democrats to work on issues of importance to rural and working class South Dakotans, like Medicaid and Medicare, and to work with labor unions. 
“There’s a direct correlation between the strength of the middle class and economic security with the number of people who are in labor unions,” he said. 
He also suggested the national Democratic Party should pay more attention to places like South Dakota if it expects to build a coalition durable enough to compete outside of its traditional strongholds and battleground states. “A few million dollars” could make a difference and help South Dakota build the Democratic bench, he said.
“I hear people say ‘there are no Democrats in South Dakota,’” Walz said. “But there’s a hell of a lot in this room.” 
Party expects more candidates in 2026
The McGovern Day dinner is the state party’s largest annual fundraiser. Regular tickets cost $125. Meet-and-greet tickets cost twice that.
“We haven’t had a McGovern Day dinner this big at least since I’ve been around,” said Shane Merrill, chair of the state party.  
The party leaned into Walz’s fame for more than ticket sales. Vermillion brewery XIX whipped up a batch of “Walz on Tap” blonde ale, sold by the can at cocktail stations and by the four-pack in a silent auction.

The enthusiasm was tempered by reality. South Dakotans registered as independents or without any political affiliation outnumber Democrats. Republicans have the most registrants and hold every statewide office, all three of the state’s congressional seats, and all but nine of the seats in the 105-member Legislature.
Democrats have faced criticism during recent South Dakota election cycles for not fielding candidates, sometimes for offices as high as Congress. Before the speeches started Saturday, state party Executive Director Dan Ahlers said that won’t be a problem in 2026.
“I need two of me to interview all the people who want to run,” he said. 
The party already has candidates for U.S. Senate (Julian Beaudion), secretary of state (Terrence Davis) and U.S. representative, although Ahlers said that candidate won’t announce until the fall. Nineteen-year-old Robert Arnold has announced his candidacy for governor, and Ahlers said he expects another hopeful to announce for that race, as well.
Later, speaking from the stage, Ahlers declared “we can no longer be content with a few seats at the table. We need to run the table.”
“It shouldn’t be enough to field a good Democratic candidate,” he said. “We need to elect Democratic candidates.” 
State Sen. Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, said she’s proud to have been the first female state Senate minority leader, but told the audience that it took time to get there. She lost in her first run for office in 2020, but “knocked on thousands of doors” and won on her second and third go-rounds.
Democrats believe, she said, “that you’re no better than anybody else, and we’re all in this together.”
“That is a politics worth showing up for,” Larson said.

The question now is how broadly the class action process could be used to address other issues where the government has taken illegal action against large groups of Americans across state lines. 
The post With birthright case, class actions emerging as important tool against reckless Trump actions appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","At the close of its spring term, the Supreme Court dealt a serious blow to the power of all Americans to protect themselves from illegal government actions. In Trump v. CASA, Inc., the court held that individuals, organizations, and even state governments cannot obtain “universal” injunctions from a federal court that are binding across the country.  
Preservation of the rule of law for all Americans now requires that we turn to other strategies to hold the Trump administration accountable. Expanded use of class actions against the federal government appears to be among the best remaining options to secure our rights and prevent government overreach. 
The practice of obtaining universal injunctions, often referred to as “nationwide” injunctions, had become a favored tactic of aggrieved individuals and organizations seeking to protect against overreaching government action. The tactic had been used against the government by partisans of all stripes, often on ideological grounds. It was employed, with frustrating success, during recent Democratic administrations by Republicans (who filed many cases in Texas or Florida). More recently, the tables have been turned by Democrats (filing in jurisdictions like California, Washington, or Massachusetts).  
The case in which the Supreme Court finally chose to limit federal court authority to issue universal injunctions is about the crucially important right to birthright citizenship – a straightforward case of constitutional interpretation that, even if the constitutional language was not clear, has been settled by Supreme Court precedent for more than 100 years.  
In the context of birthright citizenship, only a nationwide injunction makes sense because, most obviously, someone cannot rationally be declared a United States citizen in Massachusetts without being afforded the same rights of citizenship when across the border in New Hampshire.   
So where does the Supreme Court’s ruling leave birthright citizens? Does each person who was born in the United States need to file a separate case to have the government’s executive order on birthright citizenship deemed illegal and/or inapplicable to them? Probably not. 
As the Supreme Court majority opinion suggests, the question of the constitutionality of birthright citizenship can be decided for all birthright citizens in the context of a class action. Indeed, last week the plaintiffs in another case seeking protections for birthright citizens, Barbara, et al. v. Donald Trump, et al, filed in New Hampshire, obtained class certification and a nationwide injunction for class members. 
This is not a surprise. The question of the legality of Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order presents a classic case for class action treatment. It provides a single overriding common question based on a straightforward legal issue (and a longstanding Supreme Court precedent). That common question leads directly to the uniform conclusion that the executive order is unconstitutional with respect to every affected individual across the nation.   
After the class in New Hampshire was quickly certified, the rule governing class actions permitted those appointed to represent the class to apply immediately for an injunction on behalf of the entire group of affected individuals. That injunction looks virtually the same as the ones the Supreme Court just struck down. 
The question then is how broadly the class action process could be used to address other issues in which the government has taken illegal action against large groups of Americans across state lines.  
Could it be used, for example, to address wholesale visa revocations that have occurred without compliance with immigration regulations? Lawyers in New Hampshire are trying. They are seeking class action status to represent many international students whose visas to study in the US are at risk because of the Trump administration’s blanket revocations. 
Would class action status be granted to federal employees across the country who were illegally terminated from their jobs by DOGE?  It might, if they have a common claim that their termination was illegal under a specific law or regulation, including civil service regulations. Similarly, class action status and injunctive relief might be granted to community-based non-profits that have had their funding terminated in the middle of a lawfully awarded grant. 
One irony of the Supreme Court’s promotion of class actions as an alternative to universal injunctions is that the court has spent the last two decades limiting class actions in a variety of ways. It is much harder now than at any time since class action practice became embedded in American jurisprudence to get class treatment for a group with an interest in a common outcome.  
However, there is a specific provision in the class action rule (Rule 23(b)(2)) that still provides a pathway to injunctive relief. Courts that might have issued a nationwide injunction before the Supreme Court’s recent ruling might well be open instead to considering use of class procedures to achieve effectively the same result.  
There is no doubt that fighting illegal government action became harder after the CASA decision. But the Supreme Court has spoken, and the opportunity to pursue class actions is the lifeline they chose to throw us.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”

– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor




The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
 Sex-based protections

The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
 ‘Scientific and policy debates’

Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.
So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.
But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.
“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.
  Rayna Paul, environmental director for the Native Village of Kipnuk, said the $20 million grant awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to the village was crucial for protecting buildings, homes and infrastructure threatened by riverbank erosion. But now the grant has been canceled, and the village may eventually have to relocate. (Photo courtesy of Rayna Paul)
Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.
Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.
The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.
Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.
The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.


Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations

Two weeks ago, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.
“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”

The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:
“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.
But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.
Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.
  The streets of Pound, Virginia, were underwater after severe flooding in July 2022. Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit organization, planned to use a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to demolish flood ravaged buildings in the community and to design a wall to protect its downtown. But President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly canceled the funding. Appalachian Voices is among a group of nonprofits, tribes and local governments suing the EPA to restore the funding. (Willie Dodson / Appalachian Voices)
Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,” more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.
“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.
On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

From hope to heartbreak in Texas

The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.
Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.
But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.

But that grant was canceled. (Photo courtesy of Downwinders at Risk)
“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.
He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.
The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.
“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”

With the American Rescue Plan Act supplying $273 million the DNR was able to reduce its decades long maintenance and repair backlog, while developing a new state park in Flint, with construction on the park expected to finish in 2026.
Out of 168 projects, the DNR has begun or completed 122, with the department beginning its efforts in early 2024. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“These critical federal relief funds are at the heart of many incredibly transformative projects at 55 state parks across our peninsulas,” Kristen Kosick, the department’s parks and recreation chief said in a statement. “Visitors are already seeing or will see important upgrades and enhancements to park amenities and infrastructure, changes that are geared toward a safer, more welcoming environment, greater comfort and more positive guest experiences. We appreciate the public’s understanding and patience while some locations are closed for construction, and we look forward to visitors enjoying these vital upgrades when the projects are complete.”

A white mob burned New York City’s Colored Orphan Asylum. The drawing above depicting that attack was featured in Harper’s Weekly on Aug. 1, 1863.
The Civil War Draft Riots began in Manhattan — one of the bloodiest insurrections in the nation’s history. What started as a riot by white working-class residents, upset by the government’s draft, turned into an attack on Black Americans. The mob of thousands torched dozens of buildings, including the Colored Orphan Asylum, which housed up to 800 children. 
“On the 13th July at 4 PM, an infuriated mob … surrounded the premises of the Asylum and 500 of them entered the house … they deliberately set fire to it … simply because it was the home of unoffending colored orphan children,” according to the orphanage’s board minutes. 
The mob shot, hanged and burned Black residents. A crowd watched as the mob tortured and killed sailor William Williams. No one intervened, and when the mob finished, they cheered, promising to carry out vengeance on “every n—– in New York.” 
By the end of the carnage, at least 120 had been killed, and more than 2,000 were injured. Within two years, the Black population had plummeted beneath 10,000, the lowest for the city in more than three decades. Many of those who stayed eventually made their way to a neighborhood now known as Harlem.

Now is the time.
It has been an oft-used phrase, so much so that the gravity of what is happening feels softened. However, we are at a critical juncture in history — we have the gift of hindsight, the knowledge of what’s to come and the rights to actually do something about it.
What do I mean by this?
Hindsight shows us the patterns of fascist regimes and those that run them. One need only read a book like Ruth Ben-Ghiat’s “Strongmen” (written back in the dark ages of 2020) or watch a documentary about World War II to understand the playbook. Forget that Project 2025 was posted publicly for years on the internet before the 2024 election cycle revved up: there’s precedent for all of what we are experiencing now.
Which leads to what’s to come. Perhaps we don’t have a word-for-word script for what we are going to face as a country under a blatantly authoritarian regime, but a thematic overture is being played over the airwaves, online, and in conversation around us. The grip is tightening and we are being steered towards the edge of a cliff where our rights will fall away from us as we plummet to the bottom.
Despite the ominous music, though, our right to free speech has not been taken away yet. Trump has said he wants to deport or imprison people who disagree with him, but he doesn’t have the infrastructure at the moment to make this possible. So, we have to hustle to stand up for what we do believe in so such a foundation cannot be finalized. This means time is of the essence — now.

Vermont is in a particularly appropriate place for such action with the Burlington International Airport. If the citizen researchers have indeed gotten the numbers correct, Vermonters are on the hook for several hundred people being transported by ICE to other locations.
This is not something to let pass under the radar.
It is the blatant use of authoritarian power in a state that prides itself on progressive politics, one that sent forth a democratic socialist to the presidential primaries. Within these borders, innocent humans are being shipped off like cargo, treated like criminals when their only crime is existing.
What we do now (or what we don’t) will matter not only for Vermont’s reputation, but for any state with an airport, train station, etc. where such acts are happening. Inaction will send the message to those in power that we think this is okay. It will continue to deepen our complicity in the atrocities that have already been allowed to occur, and literally clear the runway for more grievous acts of violence and oppression.
It is incredibly important that Vermonters reach out to the Burlington International Airport and express their concern about the use of a community resource to aid and abet a fascist project. We need to demand accountability. 
We have the ability to change the course of history, but the window is closing gradually every day. The more we let it close, the more effort it will take to open it again.

I’ve worked in early childhood policy, sat on education boards, and am a parent of two kids. So, I no longer see school funding as just a line item—I see it as a living ecosystem. One that touches every part of how we grow up, how we govern, and how we feed both bodies and minds.
And when you take $169 million out of that ecosystem? You starve it.
Let’s be clear about the headline: $169 million in federal education funding, already appropriated for North Carolina public schools, is being withheld by the Trump administration.
That’s not just a number. That’s breakfasts unserved, teaching assistants laid off, classroom repairs delayed, and after-school programs canceled. In rural and urban schools alike, it means the things children need most—predictability, nutrition, safety—get pushed to the side while adults debate in far-off chambers.
 Let’s talk about food
Schools aren’t just places where children learn to read. They’re where many children eat their only consistent meal of the day. When funding disappears, so do food programs—especially the locally grown, nutritionally rich ones that require coordination between cafeterias, farmers, and county budgets.
This is North Carolina—a state with deep agricultural roots. Our school meals should be built from what we grow: sweet potatoes, collards, strawberries, milk, and cornmeal. But farm-to-school programs rely on investment. So, when funds vanish, kids get boxed meals with shelf-stable processed food, while nearby farmers struggle to stay in business.
It’s a cruel irony. The same week students go hungry, local produce goes unsold. That’s what happens when we treat food as a commodity instead of a public good. When we sever schools from farms, and children from land, we lose more than money—we lose the muscle memory of community.
 What are public schools for?
Public schools are more than academic institutions—they are community anchors, disaster shelters, polling places, nutrition hubs, and neighborhood stabilizers. When we underfund them, we’re not just weakening the education system—we’re weakening the civic infrastructure that holds us all together.
That’s why this $169 million shortfall hits differently. It isn’t just about teacher salaries or textbooks (though those both matter deeply). It’s about the entire network of care that makes public life possible:
The school nurse who catches the first signs of asthma before a child ends up in the ER. The cafeteria worker who packs extra food on Fridays for kids who won’t eat again until Monday. The bus driver who is the first adult a child sees each morning—and often the steadiest.
Public schools are one of the last remaining public goods that serve everyone—regardless of income, zip code, or political party. When we defund them, we say that children’s futures are negotiable. That community stability is optional. That public life itself can be privatized.
 This isn’t just education policy. It’s a moral test.
When federal funds are withheld, and states like ours already dodge their constitutional obligations (see: Leandro), it’s easy for people to tune out. But that’s exactly the problem. We’ve grown numb to numbers, disconnected from consequences.
So let me bring it home:
That $169 million could support thousands of teaching assistants—most of whom are women of color, holding schools together on poverty wages. It could modernize HVAC systems in aging schools where students are breathing mold. It could expand partnerships between school districts and small farms—keeping our children healthy and our economy rooted.
But none of that happens if we accept political theater over public trust.
 So, what can we do?
We start by remembering what schools represent: the original community commons. A place where futures are planted like seeds—and either watered with investment or left to dry up under budget shortfalls.
We don’t have to accept scarcity as inevitable. We don’t have to pit programs against each other. We can demand better—from Raleigh, from Washington, and ourselves.
Local giving helps. Advocacy helps. Voting helps. But more than anything, reframing our mindset helps. Public schools, public food, and public life are not luxuries. They are infrastructure, just as vital as bridges and roads—and far more human.
So, if you’ve ever cared about a child, shared a meal, or voted in a school gym, this story is yours too.
The question isn’t just “Where did the money go?”
It’s: What kind of future are we growing—and who gets to harvest it?",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AdobeStock_education-funding.jpg,,,2025-07-13 08:05:51.279321

The norm today is that everyone my age has a smartphone and social media. What is not generally known is just how harmful these things are to the underdeveloped mind of the adolescent.
As a 14-year-old myself, I deny the necessity of having a personal internet-connected electronic device. Of course, people may argue that a phone will be needed for communication purposes.  A landline or a talk-and-text phone satisfies that demand.
But besides this, I find that everything that is a part of growing up is better carried out without a smartphone.

Adults tell me all the time how addictive merely scrolling on a screen is for them. So how much self-control are teens my age supposed to have while being exposed to social media platforms that are algorithmically designed to keep them hooked?
It simply isn’t fair. Parents ask too much of their kids to be able to regulate themselves when handed such powerfully addictive forces. 
Usage inevitably results in derailment of human functioning. Access to social media can result in emergency room visits and death. The way I see it, the idea of even possessing a device capable of providing access to such harm is unacceptable. But why, then, are so many kids, of all ages through 18, being forced to put up with it on such a large scale?
So-called safeguards and moderation of use are ineffective. These products are designed to be addictive. Compare this to smoking: you wouldn’t give someone a cigarette because it has minimal benefits like relaxation, has a filter, and then tell them to resist the addictiveness of nicotine by using it in moderation.
My peers never asked for a defective tool to make their lives miserable and unsuccessful. When children ask for a phone, they are really asking to not be left out, which is normal and reasonable. But on what planet is it okay to “be included” at the cost of so much harm? The price is ruining, and even terminating children’s lives. 
When I think of what decision my parents made in raising me that I’m most grateful for, what always comes to mind as largely significant is that they have given me a screen-and-social-media-free childhood. If screens were a big part of my life, they would eventually replace everything else important to me.
We don’t need smartphones and social media, no matter how much Big Tech wants us to believe otherwise. Submitting because of the pressure to “fit in” means that my peers are being compromised to satisfy industrial greed. 
When has “It’s too hard for me to forgo for x,y and z reasons” been the right response to anything that we know is dangerous? Adults, with all due respect, please be responsible. Don’t wait until your own child has been harmed to take action. 
It’s been discouraging to watch so many of my peers buy into the shiny new promise of “digital is better.” My friends dismiss my entreaties for them not to pick the poisoned apple, by saying things like, “If you don’t have a phone, you’re behind the times.”
Behind?    
No. Not behind, but not a part of the unhealthy norm. One after the other, I watch my peers join the crowd, all marching towards the glowing iPhone screen for a horizon. It beckons to them like some sort of masked beacon of doom. They know no better than to march on, fixated and drawn by the intoxicating glow, and can’t slow their steps as they approach the abyss into which thousands have already fallen for one reason. 
Not many stay “behind” with me, and I see the consequences daily. My peers with phones and/or social media are often visibly shallower of thought, and less inclined to be interested in aspects of real life. It gets harder and harder to find other kids who are interested in much else. 
The ideal alternative to a screen based childhood is as described in the Vermont Declaration of Digital Independence. 
Recently in Vermont, a bill that banned smartphones in schools was passed. As this bill goes into effect, I hope parents may feel relieved of the pressure to give their children social media.  One of the biggest reasons parents give social media is because schools formerly required students to use it.
Vermont schools may henceforth exemplify how much healthier phone-and-social media-free environments are to communities not only nationally but globally. Vermont is the first state to make it illegal for schools to use social media to communicate with students. Other states should follow suit ASAP.
A screen-and-social-media-free childhood should not be considered a privilege that is impossible to accomplish because it means challenging the norm. It is crucial to the lives of my generation to take this step.
For the sake of my peers, I hope that together as a community we can take the right steps towards making childhood safe, supportive and screen-independent.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-13 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Trump’s big bill passage means lost opportunity for Mississippi, but Medicaid expansion is still doable",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/13/medicaid-expansion-trump-big-bill/,"Column: Requiring work for Medicaid recipients — a provision that killed an effort in 2024 to expand Medicaid in Mississippi — is now law of the land under Trump's so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill."" Expanding Medicaid could still save lives.","If they only knew then what they know now.
In hindsight, Mississippians who supported Medicaid expansion would have been better off had they accepted a work requirement in the 2024 legislative session.
Instead, many Democrats in the Mississippi House helped block a bill that would have enacted Medicaid expansion in the state to provide health insurance for primarily the working poor, but only if it included a work requirement. 
At the time, House Democrats rightfully pointed out the administration of former President Joe Biden would not have approved the work requirement, thus preventing the bill from becoming law. Additionally, Democrats argued that some states had tried to implement work requirements in their expansion plans but were shot down by federal courts under the first administration of President Donald Trump.
But now, thanks to since-reelected Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” as it is called, all Medicaid adults under the age of 65, except for certain groups such as parents of young children, students and the disabled, must work to receive Medicaid coverage.
If the bill had passed in the 2024 session of the Mississippi Legislature, the state would have Medicaid expansion now providing health care to many poor, working Mississippians  — at least those earning up to $21,579 per year for an individual and up to $44,363 annually for a family of four.
And regrettably for Mississippi, the “Big Beautiful Bill” is repealing a component passed during the Biden administration that would have provided a significant additional financial incentive for Mississippi and the other nine holdout states to finally expand Medicaid. That financial incentive equated to about $700 million for Mississippi.
If Mississippi had expanded Medicaid in 2024 with the work requirement, the state would have gotten a large portion of those financial incentive funds. Now, if Mississippi expands Medicaid, it will not get that financial incentive.
But importantly, the federal government still pays 90% of the health care costs for people on Medicaid because of expansion. That is a substantial financial incentive on its own that is not going away.
In reality, the reason Medicaid expansion did not pass in 2024 is much more nuanced than just blaming legislative Democrats. After all, Republicans hold a two-thirds supermajority in each chamber of the Mississippi Legislature. They have the votes to pass whatever they want.
But because not all Republican lawmakers were on board with Medicaid expansion in Mississippi, it is far from certain that any proposal — including the early ones House Democrats and others opposed — could have passed the state Senate even with the work requirement. House Speaker Jason White said at the time there were not enough Senate Republicans on board to pass the bill.
And it should be pointed out House Democratic leaders, trying to solve the impasse and get Medicaid expansion over the finish line in 2024, made the offer to vote for a Medicaid expansion proposal with a work requirement if the bill provided the opportunity to pass Medicaid expansion in future years without the work requirement. They feared that a Democratic presidential administration or courts would reject a work requirement every year and expansion would never come to fruition.
As it turned out, though, Trump won the election, and congressional approval of his “Big Beautiful Bill”  makes the work requirement the law of the land.
Perhaps more onerous than the work requirement is the burdensome, often duplicative paperwork Medicaid recipients and others receiving federal aid must navigate and the fees recipients might have to pay to receive services. It almost seems “Big Beautiful Bill” supporters are opposed to people receiving health care.
The new law also has other components that are related to the 2024 Medicaid expansion debate in the Mississippi Legislature. Legislative Democrats had been trying for years to expand Medicaid. Republicans, with their supermajority, blocked those Medicaid expansion efforts.
But by 2024, new Republican House Speaker White and some other Mississippi Republican legislators, though not all, were amenable to some type of Medicaid expansion.
But other Republicans argued that Medicaid expansion was not needed because some of the working poor, though not the poorest, could receive private insurance through the federal Affordable Care Act exchanges with the federal government paying most of the costs.
Many hospital administrators argued the federal exchanges did not guarantee them as much of a revenue stream as did Medicaid expansion.
But those arguments now are moot because the Biden-era enhanced federal benefits that were provided for people who received insurance through the exchanges lapsed and were not extended by the “Big Beautiful Bill.”
But the upshot of all this is that despite Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” Mississippi still has an opportunity to expand Medicaid with the federal government paying most of the costs.
For poor working Mississippians with no health insurance and for struggling hospitals, that still could genuinely be a big, beautiful thing.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/11141857/3X0A2725.jpg,,,2025-07-13 08:05:51.279321

Roughly 70% of the state’s farms carry no crop insurance, according to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  High risks, low payouts: Vermont farmers say crop insurance falls short.","Justin Rich’s Burnt Rock Farm lost $200,000 last year, after floods covered entire fields on his riverside land in Huntington with water and debris. 
After paying his premiums to the federal government’s Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program, Rich received his payout. It was roughly $3,000 — less than two cents for every lost dollar.
“It doesn’t work terribly well on smaller, medium-scale, diversified farms like ours,” Rich said of the program.
The Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program is intended to provide recourse for farmers who don’t qualify for federal subsidies on insurance premiums for major crops such as corn, soybeans and apples. The program is not administered by a private provider like subsidized plans are; it’s a coverage service from the federal government itself.

For many farms in Vermont, a lack of access to subsidies and the small scale of their operations limit coverage options. Significant premiums and federal bureaucracy make many question whether the remaining choices are worthwhile. But as weather grows less predictable, the unchecked costs of crop disasters threaten the viability of farming in the state. 
Vermont growers whose crops qualify for traditional federal subsidies often find them helpful. Andrea Darrow, an owner of Green Mountain Orchards in Putney, said the federal apple subsidies are just enough to make premiums affordable for her. 
“We feel, like, so vulnerable without it,” she said.
When a bizarrely late frost in May 2023 destroyed 95% of Darrow’s crop, the insurance payout helped significantly with the cost of growing another crop. And the family-run business has successfully filed smaller claims on several other occasions.
But roughly 70% of the state’s farms carry no crop insurance, according to Vermont Agency of Agriculture Chief Operating Officer Nicole Dubuque.
Rich said he was surprised the number wasn’t higher. 
“Vermont’s agricultural scene is almost completely devoid of conventional grain crops,” he said.

Even some dairy farmers who grow silage corn as feed choose to forgo insurance. Earl Ransom, who owns Rockbottom Farm in Strafford, called the crop insurance industry a “scam.”
He said he prefers other methods of risk mitigation, some of which might not be an option for all farmers. Ransom doesn’t use riverbottom land and is able to produce more crop than he needs for his cows.
“The way that I farm is built on the idea of resiliency,” he said. 
Ransom and Rich agreed that the only ideal form of insurance at this stage is to have a personal buffer of money, land and crop yield.
But for most, that’s not the reality.
Dubuque said the state has been concerned for some time about the lack of options for Vermont growers to hedge their bets financially. 
Noninsured assistance premiums can be high, she explained, and federal payout calculations are sometimes affected by other regions of the country where it’s cheaper to grow crops.
There aren’t enough sweet potatoes grown in the state to develop a base price for Vermont, for example. So when Rich lost all his sweet potatoes last summer, he was given the national average price for them, which is “like an order of magnitude cheaper,” he said.
Rich also lost 34.5% of his potato crop, for which he’d paid higher premiums to get more coverage. The threshold for a payout, however, was 35%, he said.
The Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program’s administrative process can additionally burden farmers, with monthslong wait times for federal payouts, according to Rich. 
He said many small farmers who sell through farm stands and other informal venues may struggle to keep meticulous records and submit them. 
“It is not a small amount of paperwork,” Rich said.
Hank Bissell, owner of Lewis Creek Farm in Starksboro, said he tried only once, decades ago, to secure federal insurance for his farm. After a mountain of paperwork, he concluded that financially, “it wasn’t going to do me any good.”
So when the floods of 2023 and 2024 hit, the $120,000 loss Bissell endured was uninsured.
With little to no support from the federal level, he and Rich turned to the state. Both received grants from the Business Emergency Gap Assistance Program administered by the Agency of Commerce. 
BEGAP isn’t an agriculture program, but for both of them, it was a life raft.
“Very fast, very easy to apply for, and extremely useful for those of us affected,” Rich said.
Bissell said he was able to recoup 30% of his losses through the program, which prevented what could have been a financial catastrophe.
“We’ll live to gamble again,” he said.
In addition to the Agency of Commerce’s emergency provisions, state lawmakers introduced a bill during the last legislative session with the goal of establishing a ​​Farm Security Special Fund for farmers. 
One of the bill’s sponsors, Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, cited the difficulty of accessing other aid for small farms, as well as shifting climate patterns, as her rationale. 
“Having a fund that is designed specifically for farmers is an important tool to keep local agriculture viable in our state,” she said in an email.
The bill stalled in the Appropriations Committee, but lawmakers could raise the issue in the next legislative session.
Dubuque said any amount of further aid would be helpful, but that full recovery for farms after a disaster would require a significant pool of money. Expanding the Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program at the federal level could also be helpful, she said, especially if some of the administrative burden was lifted.
Tom Zacharias, president of National Crop Insurance Services, recommended that farmers also consider federal alternative insurance options like the Micro Farm Program and the Whole-Farm Revenue Protection program, which may provide diverse operations with more comprehensive coverage. 
A USDA report indicates no payouts had been made from either plan in Vermont during the 2024 crop year. Several farmers told VTDigger they had not considered these alternatives, or that both seemed prohibitively expensive.
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., issued a statement Friday announcing that Vermont farmers affected by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 can apply for expedited assistance through the USDA’s Supplemental Disaster Relief Program. 
Over $16 billion in aid from the 2025 American Relief Act is set to go to farmers across the country, the release said. Only producers who received aid through the Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program or through subsidized crop insurance in 2023 and 2024 are currently eligible. 
Dubuque reiterated the central role of small-scale agriculture in Vermont, both for food and tourism. 
“Small farms in this state are so incredibly important to our economy,” she said.

Hidden treasures abound at the corner of Williston Road and Dorset Street.
From knick-knacks and clothing to home decor and ephemera, Vintage Inspired Marketplace has over 50 vendors who do the dirty work of sorting through the endless amounts of stuff out there in the world and bringing it directly to South Burlington.
Although the weather was sunny and above 75 this Independence Day weekend, that didn’t keep passersby from stopping in to check out what offerings were available. The suite in the building at 10 Dorset Street where the shop sits is roughly 4,500 square feet and is packed wall to wall with gazillions of oddities, some new but most old.
Vintage and antique aficionados around the Burlington area may remember the 12-year stint the multi-vendor business had on Flynn Avenue in Burlington’s South End before moving south in 2023.
While the business found its new home two years ago, it was first located in the back of the building. In May 2024, the business expanded and moved to the front, street-facing part of the building and brought in even more vendors.

Rebecca Wallace, the market’s owner and operator for the past two-years, stood greeting guests as they entered and exited, usually leaving with a handful — or two — of new finds. Part of the influx of business in the last year, Wallace said, is thanks to the new digs.
“The location, you can’t beat it. I mean, we’re very visible to everybody walking by,” Wallace said. “We’re much, much busier now than we ever were, of course, in the back of the building, and even down on Flynn Avenue, where we were very tucked away.”
Being tucked away was part of the concept for the business’ previous owner, sort of like a hidden gem or destination spot. But when Wallace bought the business in 2023, she pulled back the curtain, so to speak. It was her intention to bring about a new era for a place she had grown to love over the five years she was a vendor there.
She still runs Kitschy Business, her 20th century vintage goods, ephemera and nostalgia business, out of Vintage Inspired Marketplace, occupying the suite’s front space. Her corner hosts bookshelves stacked full of classics, collectibles and old children’s illustrated books, among other things.
Books, she said, are the hot commodity among customers. She pulled out a copy of Stephen King’s 1985 short story collection “Skeleton Crew,” obviously very well loved by its previous owner.
“I’m surprised this is still here,” she said. “Reading is definitely not dead.”
Wallace said she’s almost always been a collector of old stuff but mostly had an affinity for paper — so much that, at one point, she had amassed a library of nearly 2,000 vintage children’s books. But collecting is just part of the craft, and always ensuring there’s a backstock for things that are sold is another part to it.
“The interesting part is all the fun stuff that comes in. I love going through it,” she said. “I’m a big sorter, so I love all the jewelry and buttons and stuff like that that comes in. I just got this huge lot of matchbooks from New York City and Los Angeles from, like, the 80s and 90s.”
There’s a certain type of knowledge that goes into selling, she explained, like learning prominent makers or markings. But she admits it’s impossible to know everything about everything.
“People kind of expect you to have a certain base of knowledge about certain items, at least, like the more popular stuff,” she said.
Sometimes, she buys things she knows she won’t make a lot of money on just because she wants it to pass through her store. There’s value in having people remember the market for stirring up fond memories that way.
While the place may be easier on your pocketbook than some antique stores, it’s a far cry from a junk store. Wallace has carefully designed the space since moving sellers in, but each vendor takes the curating into their own hands. Wallace drafted by hand where each space could go, how big each section could be and, more importantly, how to fit everyone in.
Still, the waiting list of vendors is upwards of 70 people long.
“There’s a really high demand for places like this,” she said.
The business stands in stark contrast to the Target just down Dorset Street. And while sorting through all the nooks and crannies to find the perfect gift or new salt and pepper shakers may not be as convenient, it is intentional.
In a world of convenience and never-ending sale racks, sometimes spending a Saturday checking out someone’s once loved treasures can remind you of some place, some person or some memory that you once loved too.
“It’s a happy place coming in here,” Wallace said. “People have good associations and memories with the things that they see. You know, ‘Grandma had that,’ or whatever.”

Where do revenue bills begin?
North Dakota’s inaugural civics bee challenged middle school students with difficult questions as it aimed to promote greater participation and education surrounding political engagement.
The Greater North Dakota Chamber sponsored the event Friday in Bismarck, with the winner advancing to a national competition.
Arik Spencer, president of the Greater North Dakota Chamber, said low voter turnout across the country prompted the organization to partner with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation to encourage more interest in civics education.
Spencer said questions are designed to be difficult to challenge the competitors.
“The person in first place would do well in a college civics class,” he said. “This is not basic level knowledge. This is kind of a deep dive into civics. I’ve been so impressed with the students who are responding to it.”
Six state finalists competed during the event at the University of Mary, answering 20 multiple-choice civics questions.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Clara Zheng, a soon-to-be eighth grader from Erik Ramstad Middle School in Minot, answered 16 questions correctly, more than her competitors – and some adult audience members. She then presented and defended her previously prepared essay on teenage mental health concerns before a panel of judges.
Zheng will represent North Dakota at the National Civics Bee in November, the first time the state has sent a contestant.
“I feel so honored to go to nationals and represent my state,” Zheng said.
Zheng said having good civic virtues in communities and an understanding of government is important in every society.
Rep. Karen Karls, R-Bismarck, who attended the event, said the questions asked of the students were extremely difficult. 
“That’s amazing for middle school-level kids,” Karls said. “I got a few correct answers, but not nearly as many as I should have.”
Hilary Crow, vice president of civics at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, said competitors receive an extensive study guide and access to a virtual learning library to prepare.
Crow said a pilot civics competition started in 2022 with five sites and has grown to 40 states competing.
“All 50 states will be participating next year,” she said. 
The National Civics Bee, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation in Washington, D.C., will be held Nov. 10-11. The winner of the national competition will receive a $100,000 college savings plan while the second and third place finishers will receive college savings plans of $25,000 and $15,000.
“It’s one of our sacred duties to get the government we hope we deserve, so we’re excited to put this on and kick this off for North Dakota,” Spencer said. “This is going to be a big deal for North Dakota and hopefully a big deal for the future of our country in terms of getting people engaged in civics.”

The lawyer’s email arrived at 12:20 p.m. on June 2 in the inbox of Courtney Cullinan, the chief of staff to Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. It contained proposed legislative language that would benefit two of the lawyer’s clients who had regulatory and competitive problems in Connecticut’s solid-waste industry.
It was crunch time for the General Assembly, just four hours before the House of Representatives would open debate on a freshly drafted 745-page bill implementing a two-year $55.8 billion budget. The adjournment deadline for the five-month legislative session was just two days away, midnight on June 4.
The language provided by Joseph Mazzarella of McCarter & English — a law firm that employs New Haven’s influential Democratic chair, Vincent Mauro Jr., who is in a relationship with Cullinan and preceded her as chief  — would boost one client’s struggle to reopen a troubled Wallingford transfer station and help another block a competitor from buying a transfer facility in Torrington.
At Mauro’s suggestion, the email also went to another friend, someone with whom he had negotiated previous budget implementers during his time as a top legislative staffer: Franklin Perry, the chief of staff for House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
What happened next was a case study of the opaque and often chaotic nature of finalizing a budget in Connecticut — and the opportunities to do favors by shaping public policy, changing laws and sidestepping regulatory proceedings, all with little vetting or accountability.
Mazzarella’s language found its way into a nine-line, 77-word portion of a 65-page amendment produced soon after his email arrived. It was a legislative staff assemblage reflecting input from various sources that made myriad last-minute additions and subtractions to the budget implementer, House Bill 7287.
Such a narrowly tailored favor that arrives with no public vetting is known at the state Capitol as a “rat.” How Mazzarella’s proposed language got from the mailboxes of Cullinan and Perry to lines 121 to 129 in an amendment to HB 7287 is a story no one wants to tell.
The amendment was adopted on a 100-46 vote at 7:31 p.m., and the revised budget implementer passed four minutes before midnight, 99-43. No member of the Republican minority voted for the amendment or final bill.
Who did it?
No one has taken responsibility for placing the language in the implementer. Typically, any such additions are removed if opposed by either the governor’s office,  the House and Senate majorities, and in some years the Republican minorities as well. 
“Toward the end of session, any number of issues arise to be potentially added to the implementer. A provision will often be included if there are no objections from the House, the Senate, or the administration,”  Looney said. “Everyone has a veto.”
But the absence of an objection is not the same as an affirmation, and Ritter and Looney acknowledge a certain casual deference to items placed into the implementer by another caucus or branch of government, especially if they are not obviously counter to the interests of another.
“It’s hard to just quote, unquote, sneak something in without people noticing,” said Ritter. He conceded not everything gets flagged by staff for leadership at crunch time. “You have to triage what’s of most importance to either your caucus or your chair or your leadership.”
Two years ago, a freshman House Republican managed to get a single sentence included in the 832-page state budget that blocked a warehouse distribution project near his neighborhood in Middlebury.
One major difference with the Middlebury rat is that every legislative caucus leader and the governor’s chief of staff eventually acknowledged to the Connecticut Mirror that they were aware of the measure, and it was a favor admittedly sought on the freshman’s behalf by the House Republicans leader, Vincent J. Candelora.
This year, no legislative caucus is claiming credit or accepting blame for the trash rat, the governor’s office denied agreeing to its inclusion, and Looney, Ritter, Candelora and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, say they were unaware of its consequences when the amendment was finalized. 
“No one approached me,” Looney said.
A wide range of local officials and legislators who had been tracking the fate of the Torrington transfer station, which was owned by a public entity slated for extinction on July 1, said they were shocked to learn of it.
Among them was Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, whose district includes communities whose trash goes to the Torrington transfer station. Nominally a sponsor of the amendment as co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, she also was tasked with offering and defending it on the House floor.
Her first effort to describe the amendment took 25 seconds. She said it simply adopted revenue projections accepted that morning by the finance committee and made “technical revisions and corrections.”

Republicans immediately complained the amendment was nearly incomprehensible without a painstaking analysis, one that would take hours to complete. It was packed with terse references to changes in the underlying budget bill:
“In line 493, strike “$110,400” and insert “$115,000” in lieu thereof
In line 520, strike “ninety-nine million six hundred thousand” and insert “one hundred one million” in lieu thereof
In line 521, strike “ninety-three million three hundred thousand” and insert “ninety million” in lieu thereof ” …
Under legislative rules, the budget bill must be available in the legislature’s public data system for review for 12 hours, even if some of those hours were prior to sunrise. There is no 12-hour rule for a budget amendment.
“We got this amendment no less than 10 minutes ago,” Rep. Jay Case, R-Torrington, told Horn. He noted a hard-to-decipher reference to the Torrington transfer station and a non-existent “Northwest Resource Recovery Authority” and asked, “And why is it in this document?”
Horn consulted staff and looked at the amendment. Forty seconds passed. Deputy Speaker Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, who was presiding, prodded her to answer.
“Rep. Horn?” Mushinsky said.
“Just clarifying the information to make sure I’m — mostly correct what this section of the bill refers to,” Horn replied.
It became obvious to Republicans that the respected Democratic insider had not possessed the amendment much longer than the GOP outsiders quizzing her. That proved too much for Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee.

“I would really love to do a hands-raised of how many people have read it — before the vote gets done,” Nuccio said. “Or if we’re just voting blindly here, because this isn’t even the blind friggin’ leading the blind. It is deceptively blind.”
Horn said last week that Nuccio was correct in her assessment.
“I thought I knew what was in it,” Horn said. “I had notes as to what was in it, but they were not complete, I regret to say.”
The amendment was far from merely technical. It moved millions of dollars around the budget, duplicated bills that had been passed by the House but might not clear the Senate, and did two significant favors for Mazzarella’s clients, Country Holdings and Enviro Express.
At the time, Country Holdings was trying to negotiate a consent agreement with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to resolve violations, a first step to considering a permit to reopen a Wallingford transfer station it acquired in 2019 and closed in 2023. The amended budget directed DEEP to immediately issue a temporary permit.
A DEEP spokesman says the legislative directive to issue a temporary permit to Country Holdings in Wallingford came without warning and is without “modern precedent.” The temporary permit would have come before the typical review of an applicant’s finances and engineering drawings, as well as an assessment of the environmental impact on the host community by odor, noise and traffic.
(Last week, DEEP told the Connecticut Mirror the attorney general had advised the provision as written is not enforceable, and no temporary permit can be issued.)
A list obtained Thursday in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act shows that Mazzarella, Mauro and Cullinan were participants in a video meeting on Dec. 13, 2024, to discuss issues at the Wallingford site with Commissioner Katie Dykes and other DEEP officials.

Whether Cullinan played a role beyond facilitating a meeting with the commissioner is unclear, as is the case for Mauro. He is a lobbyist at McCarter & English, but he was not registered to represent either Country Holdings or its owner, Richard Antonucci Jr.
Neither Cullinan nor Mauro have agreed to on-the-record interviews since June 28, when CT Mirror first reported the inclusion of the language sought by Mazzarella on behalf of Country Holdings and Enviro Express. Cullinan’s only on-the-record comment came in that story, when she said,  “I heard about it, but I am not necessarily familiar with it.” 
Perry, the other Democratic chief of staff, did not respond to requests for comment.
Mauro has referred inquiries to Mazzarella. With regard to the legislative language that ended up in the budget implementer, Mazzarella said that Mauro’s only role was to tell him who should get the proposed amendment language helping his clients.
“I was very aware of not implicating anything related to the legislation,” Mazzarella said, noting Mauro was not registered to lobby for Country or Enviro. “So the only thing I ever asked the guy was, ‘Who are the right people to write a letter to?’” 
He then wrote to Cullinan and Perry.
The paper trail ends there.
The Torrington issue
The Torrington issue is complicated, arising from a months-long debate over the disposition of transfer stations in Essex and Torrington that had been owned by MIRA, the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority. Enviro Express operated the Torrington facility by contract.
With the closure in 2022 of MIRA’s primary asset, an aging trash-to-energy plant in Hartford’s South Meadows that once incinerated one-third of Connecticut’s municipal solid waste, the successor MIRA Dissolution Authority, or MDA, was winding down operations and selling assets. 
A non-controversial ratification of MDA’s agreement to transfer ownership and permits of the Essex station to the host community already was in the implementer bill. Control over Torrington was not.
Most, but not all, of the communities under contract with MIRA to send their waste to Torrington had been working on a public option, rather than selling the transfer station to a private company in what has been a rapidly consolidating trash industry, both in Connecticut and nationally.
The Northwest Hills Council of Governments, which includes Torrington and 20 other communities, thought the region had the framework of a deal in February, when the MDA board approved a non-binding agreement for Northwest Hills to take it over by June 30, the day before dissolution authority would cease to exist. 
But in May, the MDA board agreed to conditionally accept a $3.25 million offer from USA Waste & Recycling, a major family-owned Connecticut company that contracts with municipalities for curbside waste and recycling collection and processes that material at its transfer stations and a recycling sorting plant.

Paul Harrington, an MDA board member and town manager of the Northwest Connecticut town of Winchester, said the public authority envisioned for a region of 113,000 people spread over 786 miles was not sustainable and would require a subsidy to launch.
USA offered a long-term contract with cheaper rates and would generate revenue from the sale, not require a subsidy.
“We were in the middle of negotiating the sale to a private company, and, boom, they dropped the rat on us,” Harrington said. 
USA issued a statement saying, “The MDA determined our plan would deliver stable, affordable rates for 5 to 10 years, and contribute $3.25 million toward cleaning up the MIRA South Meadows facility. Each community would have the option to participate and determine the length of that participation at their sole discretion.”
“In contrast,” the company said, “the public option was never publicly vetted, depends on an approximately $6 million taxpayer subsidy, includes no funding for environmental remediation, and would result in tipping fees at least $10 higher per ton for local residents, which would increase after the expiration of the subsidy.”

If sold to USA, the proceeds would have gone to the cleanup of the MIRA site in Hartford, a relatively small contribution toward the tens of millions expected to be needed to demolish the former trash-to-energy plant and remediate a polluted site by the Connecticut River adjacent to a park, either for recreation or redevelopment.
Mazzarella didn’t object to the characterization of his legislative language as a rat, but he insisted it was a good rat — serving a public purpose by keeping the Torrington permit in public hands, as Torrington Mayor Elinor Carbone and other northwest community officials desired.
“There should always be a public option,” Carbone said. “Our concern was private industry, you know, might make a sweet, attractive introductory offer on the prices. But as we all know, anybody who signed up for a good cable plan, after that introductory period is over, you have no control over those prices.”
Still, Carbone said was shocked by the legislative action, as was Rob Phillips, the executive director of the region’s council of governments. 
“I think it had something to do with the attorney for Enviro  knowing somebody who through the political framework was able to draft that legislation and get it in,” Phillips said. “I still don’t even know all the names involved.”
Carbone was in an executive session at a council meeting on June 2 when Rep. Joe Canino, R-Torrington, texted with an urgent request that she call him. Canino wanted to know if Carbone knew anything about the amendment. She didn’t.
Canino, a first-term legislator, was confused by a reference in the amendment to control of the Torrington permit, not the facility’s ownership. He thought the ownership fight over once the MDA board unanimously voted to sell to USA.
“My mayor had come to me and asked if there was anything we could do months ago,” Canino said. “And I thought the deal’s signed, sealed and delivered. It was done according to their bylaws. There’s nothing we can do.”
The border of two state Senate districts run through Torrington: one represented by Harding, the Republican minority leader; the other by a freshman Democrat, Sen. Paul Honig of Harwinton. Both say they were not told what was coming in the amendment.
 “I think it was a pleasant surprise,” Harding said. “I think the feedback I’ve gotten from municipal officials in my district is they believe this is a real opportunity to help find a more affordable and more environmentally efficient option to address waste control in the northwest corner, which is becoming a growing problem.”
Horn, whose district includes many of the Northwest Hills communities desiring a public option, said she also likes the outcome — but not the method. So did Canino and Harding.
“I would agree that rats are not the best way to do public policy,” Canino said.
So whom does he have to thank?
“I have no idea,” Canino said.
“It’s a little bit of a mystery,” Honig said.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam, who hustled to the Capitol before the session ended to see if the USA sale and $3.25 million for the Hartford cleanup could be salvaged, said the House speaker initially was hopeful, but he first had to determine who was behind putting the rat in the budget implementer.

“Everybody was just trying to figure out where it came from. It’s like chasing this rabbit around the Capitol,” Arulampalam said. 
Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, who is Senate finance committee co-chair and a member of the MDA board, said the amendment “throws a grenade” into what was to be orderly transition in Torrington. While a new public authority will hold the permit, ownership has defaulted to the state Department of Administrative Services.
Fonfara said he, too, was blindsided by the amendment. Despite its impact on Hartford and his role on Finance, Revenue and Bonding, no one flagged it. He said he was told a fix was coming, but none came when the Senate approved the budget the next day.
Ultimately, Ritter said, he will look for other funding to remediate the Hartford site.
Carbone said she is sympathetic if Arulampalam feels victimized by the confusing episode, as she felt after MDA stopped negotiating with her and suddenly endorsed a sale to USA.
“It was all pretty ugly,” Carbone said. “I guess you could say there were a lot of rats.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MIRA-DISSOLUTION-0630-DE-089-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-13 05:02:05.827082

The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season has arrived, and while New England is no stranger to the impact of powerful storms, more than 30 years have passed since a hurricane officially made landfall in the region (the last one to make a direct hit was Hurricane Bob in 1991). Even though hurricanes are rare in New England, we know all too well that a tropical storm system doesn’t have to be a hurricane to have devastating effects. We also know that when it comes to our unpredictable weather, “expect the unexpected” is the best policy, which is why storm preparedness is a top priority and year-round focus at Eversource. 
“As we’ve seen many times here in Connecticut, extreme weather can hit hard and cause significant damage just as it can anywhere else in the country, so we know how crucial it is to always be prepared—especially during hurricane season,” says Eversource President of Connecticut Electric Operations Steve Sullivan.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting above-normal activity for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends November 30. NOAA is forecasting a 60% chance of an above-normal season, with six to ten hurricanes having winds of 74 miles an hour or higher, and three to five major hurricanes with winds of 111 miles an hour or higher. 
“We’ve been meeting to discuss NOAA’s hurricane season forecast, and review and update our storm response protocols accordingly, but preparing for storms is something we do year-round,” says Sullivan.
The energy company works to safeguard the electric grid through system upgrades, maintenance, and proactive vegetation management to ensure reliability for customers. Trimming and removing hazard trees that threaten overhead electric lines are not only crucial to providing customers with reliable power in all types of weather, they’re also fundamental to emergency preparedness, as trees cause more than 90% of power outages during storms. 
“When a storm is approaching our area,” Sullivan explains, “we monitor multiple forecasts and ensure that our crews and equipment are ready to go, so they can respond as quickly and safely as possible to get customers back online if they do lose power.”
In advance of storms, Eversource can quickly bring on contractors to assist with power restoration. The energy company is also part of the electric industry’s mutual aid network, which connects hundreds of utilities and contract crew workforces across the United States and Canada. This critical system can be called upon to supplement Eversource’s highly skilled crews with trained workers and specialized equipment to speed restoration. 
“This network is a cornerstone of utility response during emergencies,” says Sullivan. “When a strong storm impacts our state, we rely on this extensive network of outside crews to help restore power to customers, and we’re always ready to return the favor. Last year, a contingent of our dedicated lineworkers made the journey down South to join the restoration effort in the wake of Hurricane Helene, and we couldn’t be prouder of how they stepped up to answer the call for help.”
That type of commitment from Eversource lineworkers—and lineworkers across North America—is just one example of how collaboration is key to successful emergency preparedness and response.

The comic is on a counter, placed over another Superman publication, at Prairie Dog Comics in Wichita. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)I walked into Prairie Dog Comics in Wichita looking for a hero.
Not just any hero, but the quintessential American superhero, the Man of Steel himself, an extraterrestrial refugee from the planet Krypton who made his debut in 1938, single-handedly shaped the comic book as we know it and spawned an $8 billion franchise. In various iterations he represented the New Deal, fought Nazis, celebrated Reagan-era patriotism, died and was resurrected, and broke the fourth wall of the comics panel after Sept. 11 to lament to readers that he was only a fictional character and could not help in real life.
For most of his stories — and there are many, in comics and radio and television and movies, some with complicated and competing timelines — the infant Superman is taken in by a kindly farm couple named Kent and raised at Smallville, a fictional town in Kansas. This week a major Superman movie is rebooting the myth for a new generation, and I’d come to the comics shop on Maple Street in west Wichita looking for clues to what makes Superman perennially popular.
I’ll admit up front that I have never much liked Superman except when I was a small child, because he could fly. The 1978 movie with Christopher Reeve seemed a bit silly to me, but I was 20 at the time, deep into Hemingway’s Nick Adams, and beyond all that kid stuff. My comics tastes ran more to “Heavy Metal” magazine and, later, “Watchmen” writer Alan Moore.
I haven’t paid much attention to the Superman franchise in years, but in the last few weeks I’ve been pondering the nature of heroes and myth and just why things seem so hopeless in America. What would the new Superman movie have to say to us? 
But Wednesdays are release day in the comics world and Prairie Dog Comics is doing such a steady business that I have to time my questions between customers. The shop is unassuming at first glance, with tired carpet and decor that looks as if it might be 20 or even 40 years old, but the place is crammed full of boxes and shelves and display racks of stock. You soon come to realize the shop takes its comics as seriously as anybody who took “Big Two-Hearted River” as a lesson not just in writing but in life.
Adam Rittel, the man behind the counter ringing up all those first-day releases of Spiderman and Flash, is a self-described “slinger of comics.” He says he doesn’t know much about Superman but then betrays an impressive grasp of the various universes the Man of Steel inhabits. He rattles off half a dozen story arcs. I’m unable to keep up.
Then he shows me a new movie tie-in facsimile edition of Action Comics No. 210 from 1955, featuring the first appearance of Krypto the superdog. It’s sealed in a polybag. Slipped into two copies of the comic is a “Golden Biscuit” that confers the right to attend the world premiere of the new movie in Los Angeles with its writer and director, James Gunn. He is probably most widely known for a 2014 superhero film, “Guardians of the Galaxy.”
Has the new movie spurred interest in Superman?
“Yes and no,” Rittel says. “There’s always the push when there’s a promotion.”
Has he read any reviews of the new movie?
Rittel doesn’t read reviews.
If I really want to know about Superman, he suggests, I should talk to his brother, John.
I give Rittel my cell number and he agrees to relay a message.
Meanwhile, I buy the facsimile edition of Action Comics No. 210. Once freed from its polybag, I discover I am not, in fact, a winner of the Golden Biscuit. I’ll have to see the new Superman movie without its director.
I’ve soured on the glut of recent superhero movies, except perhaps for Iron Man, because they all seem the same: all CGI spectacle and little story. But I’m hoping the new Superman movie will be different. It stars David Corenswet as you-know-who and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. It is being promoted not only as a reboot of the Superman film franchise, but as a reimagining of the DC Universe.
It’s also being knocked by some as being too political.
Dean Cain, who played Superman on television in the 1990s, said Gunn’s version was too “woke.” Superman as an immigrant was being pushed too hard. Right-wing commentators, including Kellyanne Conway, have said the movie is too ideological, but Gunn and some of the cast shrugged off criticism and said the movie was about kindness.
The film is from DC Studios, a division of Warner Bros. Discovery that creates live action and animated content based on characters from the DC Comics, including the Joker, Batman and Wonder Woman.
But the star of the DC Universe, back to 1938, has always been Superman.
The Man of Steel debuted in Action Comics No. 1, in June 1938, but Superman didn’t even get the full issue — although he did get the now iconic cover of hoisting a car over his head. Action Comics was an anthology with 11 separate features, but now the only story you’ll likely recognize in it is Superman’s. Published by “Detective Comics” — later known as DC — It was the first comic to feature a superhero. It went for 10 cents in 1938. Last year, an original copy sold at auction for $6 million.
“Superheroes are a typological category and a cultural truth,” writes Hillary Chute in her 2017 book, “Why Comics?”
“Perhaps the enduring appeal can be traced to the origin story of superheroes themselves,” Chute argues, “which itself feels like an archetypal superhero storyline. The world’s inaugural superhero is Superman, also known as Clark Kent (birth name: Kal-El, likewise the name actor Nicolas Cage gave his son), and as a character he had modest beginnings. Superman was the brainchild of two shy, bespectacled, lower-middle-class Jewish teenagers from Ohio, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, whose first incarnation of the character appeared in their own self-published magazine (or “zine”) in the 1930s.”
Siegel was the writer and Shuster was the artist.
Detective Comics bought all rights from Siegel and Shuster for $130.
“Superman was immediately hugely popular,” Chute notes, “selling out the print run of ‘Action Comics.’ Siegel and Shuster cast him as a ‘champion of the oppressed’ — he has been called a junior New Dealer. In his first storyline, for instance, Superman saves a falsely accused prisoner from a lynch mob, produces evidence that frees an innocent woman from death row, and defends a woman about to be abused by her husband.”
There were Sunday funnies heroes before — Doc Savage, for example, and Dick Tracy — but with Superman came superpowers. The transcending of the limitations of human ability likely had something to do with the economic pressures of the Great Depression and war jitters caused by worsening situations in Europe and East Asia.
Art Spiegelman, best-known for “Maus,” the graphic novel depicting his family’s suffering during the Holocaust but with the characters cast as mice and the Nazis as cats, argued in a 2019 piece in The Guardian that the golden age of comics superheroes was shaped by the rise of fascism.
“The young Jewish creators of the first superheroes conjured up mythic — almost god-like — secular saviours to deal with the threatening economic dislocations that surrounded them in the great depression and gave shape to their premonitions of impending global war,” Spiegelman wrote. “Comics allowed readers to escape into fantasy by projecting themselves on to invulnerable heroes. Auschwitz and Hiroshima make more sense as dark comic book cataclysms than as events in our real world. In today’s all too real world, Captain America’s most nefarious villain, the Red Skull, is alive on screen and an Orange Skull haunts America. International fascism again looms large.”
The Superman origin story also keys into what Joseph Campbell called “the monomyth,” the hero’s journey told in every culture around the world. It features a protagonist born of mysterious circumstances, in possession of special powers or skills, who is raised by surrogate parents and eventually brings some boon to mankind. Not coincidentally, the hero’s journey is often a cornerstone of religious or cultural narratives, including the stories of Moses and King Arthur, Jesus and Luke Skywalker.
While Superman was associated from nearly the start with Smallville, where lived a kindly farm couple who found and raised him, it wasn’t until the 1978 Superman movie that Smallville identified as being in Kansas, something that is now canon. Every June, Hutchinson in south-central Kansas “changes” its name to Smallville and has a festival weekend that includes a comic con at the state fairgrounds. The Smallville Wiki lists its zip code as 67524, in real life the postal coordinate for Chase, a town in Rice County.
Directed by Richard Donner, the 1978 film featured Marlon Brando as Superman’s real father and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane. It was notable for its special effects, the now-iconic John Williams score, and Gene Hackman’s over-the-top performance as Lex Luthor. In a 1978 interview in the Edmonton Journal, Donner said his movie was true to the “legend and myth” of Superman’s origin story, including his upbringing in Kansas.
In the 1990s, there was the television series “Lois and Clark: the New Adventures of Superman,” and “Smallville” ran from 2001 to 2011. Despite differences in interpretation, the essentials of the story remained the same: Kansas, the Clark Kent/Superman duality, Clark and Lois as reporters, and Luthor as nemesis.
Siegel, the comics writer who created Superman, died in 1996, age 81. He had married Joanne Carter, the teenage model who first posed for Lois Lane in 1935 after answering a classified ad by Shuster, the artist co-creator.
Shuster died in 1992. He was 78. Even though DC bought all rights to their superhero in 1938, the publishing company gave each man an annuity of $20,000 after the 1978 movie was released, according to the New York Times.
What makes the Superman story so enduring?
“It’s a sense of right and wrong,” John Rittel, Adam’s brother, told me on the phone. “There’s a deep morality. It’s hard to put into words, but it’s about power and responsibility. Using power responsibly is something we should all be able to agree upon. It’s a symbol of hope, something you can gather around.”
John, a 42-year-old Wichita resident who says he has 31,000 comic books stored in his basement, said he’s been a fan of Superman since watching “Lois and Clark” as a kid.
“I’ve never seen an iteration (of Superman) I didn’t like,” he said. “Every one that comes out is someone’s first. And you always remember the first one you saw. … And James Gunn? In my eyes, he’s never failed. He’s always put out good stuff.”
John had not yet seen the new movie but planned to go with friends the next day.
How did he feel about the controversy over immigration?
“There’s got to be an element of truth,” he said, and it has to be relevant to the times in which it’s made. “People on one side or the other will think it’s too political, but if it opens people’s eyes …”
Can an 87-year-old fictional extraterrestrial migrant superhero raised in Kansas still be relevant?
My wife, Kim, and I saw “Superman” Thursday night. The movie opens 30 years after Kal-El comes to earth as a child — and yes, he is still adopted by a Kansas farm couple — and takes off from there. Most of the furniture from previous iterations is there, from the Daily Planet to the Fortress of Solitude, although updated a bit for the early 21st Century. Superman is battling a new version of Lex Luthor, played by Nicholas Hoult, a high tech arms-dealing billionaire who mostly rails about “the alien,” Superman.
The first 30 minutes of the film were full of character development, with Brosnahan doing the best Lois Lane of the franchise. She convincingly plays a reporter, doesn’t need saving, and seems conflicted in a realistic way about her relationship with Clark/Kal El.
Corenswet is so trusting as Superman that it’s a plot point. I liked him as Superman fine. He had the same naive charm that Reeve did.
There was a noisy 13 hours (or so it seemed) of Superman and his friends participating in a series of CGI battles, with many twists but few surprises. These kinds of digital sequences bore me because when you can do anything with 1s and 0s, without advancing the plot, nothing really matters. Give me old-fashioned practical effects every time.
But the real star of the movie is Superman’s dog, Krypto.
Kim pointed out to me that Krypto is like Toto in the “Wizard of Oz,” another movie spectacle, made (in color!) in 1939. In both cases, it’s the heroes’ love for their dogs that makes us root for them. Those dogs also engage us by making us feel discomfort when they’re in danger and joy when they’re happy.
This “Superman” is as formulaic as the ones that preceded it. Any resemblance to current events is just window dressing, so there’s not much to object to, no matter what side of the theater aisle you’re on. But I suspect the ultimate success of the Superman franchise depends on its predictability. You know that ultimately, good will prevail. It’s just that this time, it takes a little help from an extraterrestrial dog.

Not that anything you might have said would have made a difference to the inevitable:  a 5% fare hike on September 1st of this year and another 5% jump in July of 2026.  But don’t blame the railroad or Connecticut Department of Transportation.


You should really blame the legislature.  The budget they wrote this year practically required a fare increase as they under-funded the CDOT’s operating budget requests for our trains… Metro-North, Shore Line East and The Hartford Line.
So these recent hearings on a “proposed” fare increase were really for show, required by law, but mostly “political theater” (as I described it 12 years ago).
I’ve been through this charade before, attending and testifying at many, many such hearings over the past 25 years… all with the same outcome:  what was proposed was always what happened. This round, I didn’t even bother.
So why does the agency even go to the time and expense of this exercise when we know the inevitable?
Why do they prepare a 25-page Service Equity Analysis (in two languages) explaining the impact of the increased ticket costs on the poor and minorities?
Why does a team of CDOT managers travel across the state, holding these fare hearings in-person and online, basically signaling to the few people who show up to testify that they’ve wasted their time… that anything they might say can’t stop what’s coming down the track?
That seems like such a waste of the agency’s talents.  These CDOT managers want to run a good railroad but aren’t adequately funded by lawmakers.  The railroad takes the heat but shouldn’t take the blame as they were given no real choice but to raise the fares.
Sure, alternatively, they could cut service, but nobody wants that.
While the CDOT staff did not share any analysis of the effect of higher fares on ridership, they did remind us that in the last seven years fares have only gone up 14% while inflation has hit us with a 28% jump.
If fares must go up, what riders would really want would be more service and faster trains, maybe even a Quiet Car.  But the CDOT can’t deliver on those dreams.
The problem is that fares don’t even come close to covering the cost of running a railroad.  Pre-pandemic Metro-North boasted a 70+% “farebox return,” meaning that most of the operating costs for the trains were covered by ticket revenue.
But we all know what happened to ridership in the past five years.  And while it is slowly building back up (it’s up 6% in the past six months since congestion pricing began), the farebox return today is only about 38%.  Someone has to make up the difference: us riders.
And those millions of dollars being collected in tolls from drivers in midtown Manhattan?  Those can only be spent on capital improvements, not subsidies for operating costs, i.e. lowering fares.
For New York City-bound commuters, there’s little choice.  They’re a captive audience of 23,000 daily riders dealing with a monopoly that can raise prices without really  losing customers.
Driving isn’t an option, especially with an additional $9 toll now added to your daily drive into Manhattan.  And work from home was great, while it lasted.  But now you have to show up at the office in person at least a few days a week.
The CDOT now will analyze the testimony from the hearings and issue a final recommendation to the Commissioner, who will make the fare hike official.
So when your ticket price jumps, don’t blame the conductor.  Blame your elected officials for under-funding this crucial transportation resource.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ctdot-2025cover-2-1024x857.jpg,,,2025-07-13 05:02:05.827082

Hilleary, a Republican, told the crowd he is running to “ensure President (Donald) Trump has backup.”
“At the national level, I think our country in many ways is hanging on by its fingertips,” he said. “Our nation has been on a slow decline for years and that decline has been gaining steam during the Biden years.”
Hilleary said the Biden administration found “new and dangerous ways to tear down the traditional and normal symbols of this country.”
He also said Democrats had attacked Second Amendment rights and suppressed public speech — particularly regarding Covid vaccination information — criticized Biden immigration policies and addressed the issue of transgender athletes playing college sports.

Hilleary was elected to represent Tennessee’s 4th District in 1994 and served through 2002, when he narrowly lost his race for governor to Democrat Phil Bredesen. In 2006, he came in third in a three-way Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. 
He has served as chief of staff to Rose — who is running for governor in 2026 — since Rose’s 2018 election and Rose introduced Hilleary at Friday’s event, emphasizing Hilleary’s credentials as a former congressman. 
“When your chief of staff is a former Congressman, he’s held in particularly high regard,” Rose said.
Hilleary won his first election amid a conservative backlash to the policies of President Bill Clinton that ushered in a Republican House Majority for the first time in decades. He told the crowd at his kickoff he voted against Clinton administration policies more than any other member of Congress during his tenure.
About 350 people turned out at Friday’s event in Sumner County. Elected officials attending included state Sen. Paul Bailey and Rep. Paul Sherrell, both Sparta Republicans, Rep. Michael Hale, a Smithville Republican, Hendersonville Mayor Jamie Clary and Republican National Committee Committee Member Beth Campbell.

(Photo: Ioneer)A proposed lithium-boron mine in Nevada has been delayed for a second time amid a lithium price crash caused by softer electric vehicle demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally.
Earlier this month, Australian-based mining developer Ioneer Corp. agreed to delay initial construction on their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County until at least March 2026, according to a stipulated agreement.
The updated timeline comes after Ioneer lost its biggest investor in February when South Africa-based Sibanye-Stillwater scrapped its planned $490 million investment in the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Low lithium prices have forced a raft of companies to pause or delay spending on projects from Quebec to South Carolina and Argentina to Australia.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium prices soared to nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022, before hitting around $9,000 per tonne this July. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile in 2025.
Despite the construction delay, Ioneer said the company is still expecting production to start in 2028, following a three-year construction period once the company makes a final investment decision to green light the project.
That final decision will also depend on Ioneer finding an equity partner to replace the capital lost when Sibanye-Stillwater pulled out of the mine’s development.
Last month, Ioneer formally began the search for an equity partner capable of supporting an accelerated development timeline and advancing lithium-boron production at the mine. The search is expected to take four to five months, according to Ioneer.
“We’re talking to many, many different companies who have an interest in this project because of its lithium, because of its boron, and because it’s in the United States,” said Ioneer Managing Director Bernard Rowe.
Earlier this year, Ioneer also secured a $996 million federal loan from the Department of Energy following federal approval of the mine.
Volatility in the lithium market will not deter investment or the eventual construction of the Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project, said Rowe, adding that the project’s unique attributes and low-cost structure make it an attractive project.
  Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine is in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County near the state line with California. (BLM map)
Rhyolite Ridge in Nevada is one of the only two major known global deposits of lithium-boron. Boron is a mineral used in everything from glass to medicine to cleaning products. If constructed, it would be the first new boron mine in the U.S. in nearly a century. The revenue split between the two commodities is roughly 70% lithium and 30% boron, providing a potential hedge when lithium prices drop.
Ioneer estimates the cost of production at the mine at about $5,200 per ton of lithium after factoring in revenue from the boron produced at the mine, placing production costs in the lowest quartile of the global lithium cost curve.
Ioneer has experience with lithium volatility, having built similar projects during periods of lower lithium prices, Rowe said. Specific project economics rather than industry-wide conditions determine viability, he added.
“There’s very logical reasons why there is volatility. It’s because it’s a small market that’s growing rapidly, and it’s easy to get a mismatch, to either have too much supply or not enough. It’s very easy for that to happen when you’re dealing with a very small, but rapidly growing market like lithium,” Rowe said.
Simon Jowitt, the state geologist for the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology at UNR, said lithium mines that sustain low production costs can cope with lower prices. He pointed to Albemarle Corp.’s Silver Peak Mine in Clayton Valley, which has remained active since the 1950s due to its ability to sustain low production costs.
Getting to that point will be more difficult for mines that haven’t broken ground yet, said Jowitt. Construction is the most expensive period for a mining operation and requires significant capital expenditure without immediate returns. That can lead to companies pulling out of projects during drops in lithium price while investors look at more price-stable metals like gold, silver, and copper.
“We’ve seen this low lithium price impact development and slow development of lithium operations, and actually seeing some mines shutting down in Australia and other countries,” said Jowitt.
“The mines that are under construction are likely to wait until they see a rebound in the lithium price,” he added.
An Ioneer study released in June also quadrupled Rhyolite Ridge’s potential lithium-boron reserves from 60 million tonnes in 2020 to 247 million tonnes, sharply increasing both the project’s mine life and its development cost.
The reserve boost extends the expected mine life to 95 years, up from 26 years outlined in the company’s 2020 feasibility study and increases capital expenditure by more than doubled to $1.67 billion, up from around $800 million.
A longer life span could also prove vital. Despite current volatility, mining companies and analysts anticipate that demand for lithium will rise over the next decade due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage technologies.
While it’s difficult to predict future lithium prices, Jowitt said analysts expect lithium prices to become less volatile as the market matures, but that will take time and depends on demand for lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles.
A recent U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that about 87% of global lithium production goes into batteries, and the vast majority of those batteries are for electric vehicles.
However, in the near-to-medium term, production cuts may be necessary to stabilize prices and rebalance the market.
“Over the next 30 years, we are going to see a significant increase in demand for lithium, and you can say that for a wide variety of different commodities due to increasing electrification and so on. But 30 years is too long a period to actually base any development decisions on,” Jowitt said.
The mine has also faced other troubles. The project has attracted fierce opposition from conservation groups which oppose the mine’s encroachment on critical habitat reserved for the endangered wildflower Tiehm’s buckwheat. The delay was a result of a stipulated agreement between Ioneer and the Center for Biological Diversity in order to avoid a preliminary injunction for an ongoing lawsuit against the mine.

(Photo courtesy of the office of South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz)U.S. Democratic representatives characterized the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades as a cruel and wasteful political stunt following a guided tour Saturday.
Members of Congress and state legislators who visited the site described seeing bugs on mattresses, toilets and showers that lacked privacy, small food portions, and temperatures between 83 and 85 degrees in the air-conditioned areas.
“There are really disturbing, vile conditions, and this place needs to be shut the hell down,” said South Florida U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
The South Florida Democrat said 32 men slept in each of the cages with bed bunks and three sinks attached to the toilets. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced hundreds of people started arriving on July 2.

Democrats labeled the tour as sanitized because they couldn’t speak to any of the detainees or staff. Detainees have told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they hadn’t been able to shower, the toilets didn’t flush, and that the food had maggots.
Anna Eskamani, a state representative from Orlando, said Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, led the tour. The agency is in charge of the site.
“It was just incredibly dystopian, and a lot of lack of clarity on what rules and procedures are actually being followed as it pertains to those being detained, as it pertains to what their status is,” Eskamani said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
Eskamani is one of five Democrats in the Florida Legislature suing the state after they weren’t allowed to enter the detention center on July 3. FDEM invited Congress members and state lawmakers on Wednesday for the tour Saturday, when U.S. representatives said they were already planning on conducting an oversight visit.
Meanwhile, Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, defended conditions at the detention center during a press conference in Tampa on Saturday, saying it was held to the same standards as federal facilities. However, she sidestepped specific questions about the site because it is state-run.
“Any issues that were there have been addressed,” she said. “It’s a fantastic resource for us to be able to utilize in order for a detention facility to repatriate people back home to their home countries.”
Governors in five Republican states have told Noem they want to build detention centers like the one in the Everglades, Noem said. She refused to say which governors expressed interest.
Spring Hill Republican Sen. Baise Ingoglia, an ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis, also visited on Saturday. The senator, possibly in line as DeSantis’ pick as chief financial officer, wrote on X that Democrats’ rhetoric about the detention center didn’t match reality.
“I actually laid down in one of the beds and it was really comfortable, Ingoglia wrote. “So, any complaints about squalor conditions is nothing more than bullsh*t and political theater.”

“Alligator Alcatraz” is the name Florida’s Republican leadership have give to the camp.
Despite the poor conditions Democrats described, South Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said the detention center shouldn’t be compared to a concentration camp. Moskowitz served as the head of FDEM for two years under DeSantis.
“Listen, it is as bad as it can be, but it is not a concentration camp, and people should not use Holocaust references to describe what’s going on behind us,” he told reporters following the tour.

,Louisiana Illuminator,2025-07-12 20:00:22+00:00,Louisiana Illuminator,Lawsuit claims slavery persists at former St. James plantation with unmarked graves,Wesley Muller,,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/07/12/slavery-formosa/,Community activists with ancestral ties to enslaved people at Louisiana plantations are using a unique legal theory to gain access to an unmarked slave cemetery on the property of a petrochemical company.,"In this June 19, 2020 photo, members of RISE St. James pray over the graves of what are believed to be formerly enslaved Black people buried on the site of the former Buena Vista plantation. Formosa Plastics plans to build a manufacturing complex on the property. (Photo courtesy Louisiana Bucket Brigade)Community activists with ancestral ties to enslaved people at Louisiana plantations are using a unique legal theory to gain access to an unmarked slave cemetery on the property of a petrochemical company. They claim the company is practicing slavery by owning and controlling the bodies of people buried there. 
Inclusive Louisiana and the Descendants Project, two St. James Parish environmental justice organizations, joined forces to file a lawsuit against FG LA, an American affiliate of the Taiwanese petrochemical giant Formosa Plastics. One of their primary claims in the lawsuit is based on the U.S. Constitution’s 13th Amendment, which prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude.  
At the center of the lawsuit is a cemetery discovered on a tract of land Formosa purchased in 2017 to construct a massive $9.4 billion plastics facility. The land, located along the Mississippi River in St. James Parish, was once the site of Buena Vista Plantation, where enslaved Africans are believed to have been buried.
Filed in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the plaintiffs want to end Formosa’s control over the cemetery and the individuals buried there. They also claim Formosa has violated the 13th Amendment and Louisiana’s cemetery law by restricting access to the gravesites.  
In 2018, during the permitting process for Formosa’s project, archaeologists discovered unmarked graves on the property. They believe the site is a burial ground for some of the slaves forced to work at Buena Vista before and during the Civil War. When local residents from majority-Black St. James Parish learned of the graves, they began to visit the site to pray and honor their enslaved ancestors, the lawsuit states.

Residents also sought to halt construction of Formosa’s facility to, at least in part, protect what is now called the Buena Vista Plantation Cemetery. Lawsuits filed several years ago by groups such as Rise St. James and the Center for Biological Diversity, among others, were successful in delaying the project by challenging Formosa’s federal permit. Additionally, citing the company’s refusal to allow access to the cemetery, the plaintiffs obtained a court order in 2020 that forced Formosa to allow them access to the gravesite.
The new lawsuit makes similar accusations, drawing parallels between plantation owners in the 1860s and the actions of Formosa as a corporate landowner in the 2020s.
“This is an action to enforce rights to access, maintain, care for, and protect a cemetery under cemetery dedication law in Louisiana and to eradicate one of the ‘lingering vestiges of the slave system’ pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution – the continued ownership and control of the bodies of those enslaved under the slavery system,” the lawsuit states.
In a phone interview Friday, Andrea Armstrong, a Loyola law professor and an expert on 13th Amendment litigation, said such claims are seldom seen in modern cases but are rooted in sound legal theory. 
The plaintiffs argue Formosa’s ownership and control of the graves is a form of the “badges and incidents” of slavery, a phrase that appeared in court cases following the Civil War to describe unlawful actions separate from the institution of slavery but that produced some of the same effects. 
One such action, the plaintiffs argue, was the forced separation of Black families both in life and later in death when they were denied any form of dignified burials. By refusing to record their deaths or allow their loved ones to mark their graves with headstones, slave owners dehumanized Black people, causing what some scholars have called their “social death.” While such acts are different from the forced labor of slavery, they effectively produced the same result by marking people as property rather than humans with individual identities, Armstrong said. 
“There are, I think, two potential ways to understand how the 13th Amendment plays out in this context,” Armstrong said. “One is thinking about the harmed community being the people whose slavery status would appear to endure because they are denied the veneration and remembrance that we allow for other communities. And then the other is thinking about the harm occurring to the living descendants today, and the ways that they can’t access [the cemetery].”

After the Civil War, Southern states adopted so-called “Black Codes” that modern scholars describe as laws designed to continue many aspects of slavery but just in different forms, Armstrong said. Among other restrictions, they prohibited Black people from visiting and praying at the graves of their deceased loved ones.
The plaintiffs are trying to make the case that Formosa’s restrictions around the Buena Vista Plantation Cemetery produce the same effect as the Black Codes did after the Civil War. 
“And like their enslaved ancestors before them, freedpeople were also often prevented from gathering to exercise their right to religion,” their pleading states. “Descendants of the enslaved in St. James Parish have continued to face impediments to accessing and caring for the burial sites of their ancestors, including on former plantation lands now owned by Formosa.”
The plaintiffs also point to historical records showing some of the enslaved people buried at the plantation were mortgaged for loans even after they died. The pleading notes the plantation owners ascribed a value to and generated wealth from dead bodies in the graves. 
“The argument is that these people who were buried there, their slavery status continued after death,” Armstrong said. “We see that through the mortgaging of them as assets and that the inability of people today to access those grave sites in meaningful ways and establish markers is just another indication of how that slavery status endures even all of these years later.”
One of the challenges the plaintiffs might face with their arguments is that some courts still view the 13th Amendment as an old law irrelevant to modern times because some jurists think of slavery in the strictest form as forced labor.
“We haven’t seen a lot of litigation around: What does it mean to have a badge or incident of slavery?” Armstrong said. “There’s not a lot of case law that provides guidance around this, but we are seeing a resurgence in it right now.”
That uptick has mainly come from litigation against forced labor in modern prisons, including a pending case in Louisiana over the plantation-style farm labor at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.
“I do think that this intervention and litigation will provide an opportunity at least to dive a little deeper into the histories of the people who were buried there and certainly to afford the plaintiff some level of discovery and access to prove their claims of connection,” Armstrong said. “So if nothing else, they may learn more about the people who were buried there.”
FG LA turned down an interview request for this report, but company spokeswoman Janile Parks sent an emailed statement. The company is aware of the lawsuit, though it hadn’t been formally served or reviewed as of Friday, it said. The company will “be respectful of the remains and unmarked burial sites” on its property.
“With the oversight of and coordination by the appropriate governmental agencies, FG has followed all procedures in researching and preserving the protected area. FG has been fully transparent and cooperative in giving residents access to the burial site,” the statement said.
Work will continue to move the Formosa project forward, it continued. 
“FG is disappointed by the delays the project has faced, but remains confident that all permits were properly issued,” the statement said. “We do not intend to give up the fight for this important economic development project that will benefit the people of St. James Parish and Louisiana.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Alejandra Guzman-Mercado was just weeks away from graduating college – the first in her family to do so – when a judge denied her father’s request to remain in the United States and ordered his deportation.
Now, two months later, Guzman-Mercado said she’s still grappling with the emotional weight of her father’s deportation.
“My mental health has had to take a backseat because I’m taking care of other people’s mental health,” she said. “I know it’s counterintuitive, but I don’t really have time for therapy.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Latino communities across Washington have reported increased immigration enforcement, disrupting families and reshaping daily life. Some, like Guzman-Mercado, are left to pick up the pieces after deportations. Others turn to local organizations for help – but many cope alone, unsure where to turn or too afraid to speak out.
“It feels like I’m constantly trying to catch up, and I can’t, because there’s still more that I need to do,” Guzman-Mercado said.
Fear reshapes daily life
A recent survey conducted by health-policy organization KFF in partnership with the Los Angeles Times reports one-third of immigrants have had negative impacts, with many experiencing stress and anxiety, problems eating and sleeping since Trump took office earlier this year.
It also reports that 13% of immigrants, including one in five here legally, say they or a family member “have limited their participation in at least one day-to-day activity,” such as going to a community event, work or seeking medical care, over concerns about drawing attention to someone’s immigration status.
This survey builds on the 2023 KFF report, in partnership with the Los Angeles Times, and a KFF survey of immigrants in 2024 that examined claims about immigrants that circulated during the presidential election cycle.
Guzman-Mercado said these effects mirror what she’s been going through since her father, Pedro Guzman, was deported in May. Court records show her father has traffic violations, the most serious a 2020 conviction for driving under the influence, but no other criminal record.
“I didn’t notice that I wasn’t eating as well until I really sat on it and was like, ‘Yeah, this isn’t normal,’ ” she said. “Also, any kind of notification in the middle of the night will now wake me up and I have a backpack ready for when I need to go back home – so now I’m just in the current state of flight.”
She added that she feels like she can’t sleep and can’t take a break “because there’s always another thing I have to take care of to make sure the rest of my family stays safe.”
Yolanda, a 16-year-old who fled Honduras two years earlier as an unaccompanied minor, faced similar precautions after ICE agents went to her home, claiming to be doing a welfare check in April.
She agreed to speak using only her first name because of her ongoing immigration case.
“Honestly, we’ve been walking with precaution because we know that the situation here is difficult,” Yolanda said in Spanish. “But yes, we’ve been a bit scared.”
In an email to The Spokesman-Review and Spokane Public Radio in April following Yolanda’s incident, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson stated that ICE began conducting investigative activities in January to “ensure unaccompanied alien children released from the care of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement are not subjected to crimes of trafficking and exploitation.”
“ICE is fully engaged and committed to child safety and accountability for every action and person involved in the care of unaccompanied alien children,” the statement continues.
Still, Yolanda said the encounter shook her, and it took days to begin feeling normal again. While ICE hasn’t returned, she said the fear lingers.
Community support
Since her father was arrested by ICE in February, Guzman-Mercado said she has been in close contact with Nuestras Raíces Community Center, a nonprofit that serves Latino families in Spokane, Adams and Grant counties.
The organization offers services ranging from Know Your Rights workshops to mental health support at its Othello and Spokane locations.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 8% of Spokane County’s population is Latino, or about 35,000 people. In Grant County, the Latino population makes up just over 44%, while Adams County’s Latino population is nearly 65%.
Fernanda Mazcot, executive director of Nuestras Raíces, said it’s likely the population across Spokane County has increased due to “many new immigrant arrivals in the last three years.”
Mazcot started the Spokane location of the Esperanza program, which offers mental health and social services, four years ago to serve the Hispanic community.
“Many of the social work services offered by Nuestras Raíces were launched in response to COVID-19,” Mazcot said.
Guzman-Mercado said she hasn’t fully taken advantage of their services because she’s had to work extra hours and manage legal matters for her family, but it’s been helpful knowing she has their support along with the Party for Socialism and Liberation in Spokane, which has been active in protesting against immigration enforcement.
“I’ve also been fortunate enough to be connected to PSL Spokane, and they’ve given me a platform to share my family story and how this is really happening to people in Spokane and in the neighboring areas and stuff,” Guzman-Mercado said.
Jose Alvarez, a clinical social worker at Nuestras Raices’ Spokane location, said the number of youth and families seeking mental health support has increased in the past couple of months with ongoing ICE activity.
Alvarez said the organization estimates an increase around 25% to 35% over the past few months, based on their intake logs.
“I actually would say that the youth, the younger generations, are actually not fearful or scared of reaching for support if they need to,” Alvarez said.
Alvarez said he believes the increase in youth and families seeking mental health services may be partially influenced by the current events that heightened fear within immigrant communities.
“Many families are experiencing increased stress, anxiety and instability. This has contributed to a greater need for trauma-informed and culturally responsive mental health support,” he said.
Still, while the Spokane office has seen an uptick in outreach, its other location hasn’t experienced the same.
‘Hard to trust’
Esmeralda Sandoval, case manager at Nuestras Raíces’ Othello location, said since Trump took office again, there’s been at least a 45% decrease in clientele, many of whom would reach out for mental health services and individual taxpayer identification numbers.
The ID numbers are typically used by people who don’t have a Social Security number, such as foreign investors, or undocumented immigrants.
She said the uncertainty surrounding the current administration is what has caused this significant decline.
“There is a high need in mental health just, unfortunately, with everything under the current administration, it’s hard to trust,” she said.
Othello is 78% Hispanic, many who work in the agriculture industry in and around Adams County. Sandoval said that at least 85% of their clients who go to their Othello location are farmworkers, according to Data USA.
Sandoval, who was once a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and worked in the fields with her parents, said she can understand their clients’ fear and declining use of services over heightened immigration arrests.
DACA was established under former President Barack Obama and gives people who came to the United States without legal status as children legal protection that must be renewed every two years.



“I’ve gone through moving to different states working in the fields, and it’s not easy,” Sandoval said. “And now, thank God, I have legal status, but I still always worry about other people that are in those shoes.”
Alvarez also said the decrease of mental health inquiries in the Othello office is a reflection of the heightened fear that many families are under right now.
“In rural communities, other factors also play a huge role in decrease of inquiries such as lack of transportation, mistrust, stigma around mental health and the outreach capacity,” Alvarez said.
“In Spokane, we have a higher outreach capacity, more visibility, which results in higher engagement, especially during time of uncertainty and stress,” he said.
Life after deportation
Guzman-Mercado recalled the moment her family sat in the courtroom and heard the judge deny her father’s final plea to stay.
Immediately, her younger sister collapsed into her arms.
But even that moment, she said, doesn’t fully capture the heartbreak they’ve endured.
Since graduating from Eastern Washington University with a music degree earlier this spring with a focus on flute and voice, Guzman-Mercado said the aftermath of her father’s deportation has taken a heavy toll on her and her family’s mental health, compounding their emotional strain.
Her brother is 15 years old and her sister is 20. Being the oldest, she said, has made her feel a greater weight on her shoulders.
“I feel like I won’t be able to breathe right until he’s back,” she said.
His absence, she said, is a painful reminder of his unwavering dedication to their family, his pursuit of the American Dream and the joy he brought to their lives.
“He liked showing us the dumbest TikTok videos he could find to make us laugh; he would let my sister practice her waxing, when she was in aesthetician school, even though it would hurt him,” Guzman-Mercado said.
“We had even started teaching him how to play video games with us and even though he wasn’t good at all, he would make us laugh with his attempts at beating us at Mario Kart,” she said.
Despite the distance, they stay connected through daily FaceTime calls, some filled with teasing and laughter, others heavy with tears and longing.
Much of this, she said, is because returning to his home in Mexico has been a mixed experience.
Guzman-Mercado said her dad has been living with his older sister since he got deported.
“Going back has been bittersweet, because although he wanted to be back in his birthplace for so long, he wanted it to be on his terms,” she said.
Guzman-Mercado said she’s been grateful for the support and connections she’s found through organizations like Nuestras Raíces, which have helped her find clarity amid the emotional turmoil.
She’s also found a sense of community in recent protests, which she said have helped validate her experience with her father’s deportation.
But she emphasized many of the deeper issues tied to deportation – particularly mental health – often go unnoticed.
“I don’t have the luxury to cope; I have to find solutions, because there’s still bills that need to be paid,” Guzman-Mercado said.

Michigan ranked third in the country in voter turnout percentage last year, an achievement the state credits to major election reform and a strong voter education campaign.
In a first-of-its-kind “turnout report,” the Department of State highlights the effect of recent voter-approved constitutional amendments, noting an increase in turnout between 2020 and 2024, hundreds of thousands ballots cast by first-time voters and the more than 1.2 million who took advantage of the state’s new early-voting laws.
But some experts say the true driver of the gains was likely local election officials.
Corwin Smidt, interim director of Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, said that research typically held that early voting laws often don’t improve turnout much. About 255,000 early voters in Michigan hadn’t voted in 2020, the report found. But studies have found those who vote early typically planned to vote in their election anyway, and keeping an early-voting option open adds a significant burden on election officials.
Measuring the impact of any one state-level program is difficult, Smidt said, because Michigan’s elections are more decentralized than in most states. In Michigan, it’s up to city or township officials to run elections, rather than county leaders.
Local and county clerks did great work to educate voters, he said, but it’s difficult to know how much of that came out of local budgets and how much was state-supported. Livingston County Clerk Elizabeth Hundley said that she wasn’t aware of any statewide campaign, but that local clerks in her county worked hard to educate voters.
“They were on social media, in publications, on people’s water bills, doing whatever they could to make sure people knew what their rights were,” Hundley said. It paid off — Livingston had the second-highest turnout rate in the state: 86.4% of active registered voters.
Angela Benander, spokesperson for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, said the state’s efforts included partnerships with hundreds of local and national groups, including the Detroit Lions, Detroit Pistons, business partners, a college student task force, and more.
The data in the Department of State report is still helpful, Hundley said, because it helps clerks figure out where to focus their effort in future elections. But as the county’s lead election official, she already had access to local and county-level data.
Some observers saw the report — and its timing — as a move to raise the profile of the Department of State and Benson, who is a Democratic candidate for governor. Benson, who is leading some polls, has run up against attempts from Republican lawmakers to paint her as a lawbreaker who has run flawed elections, and has cited the conflict in her fundraising appeals.
“If they’re releasing a report like this, it’s probably much more targeted to primary voters and external stakeholders, people outside the state who would instantly accept this sort of assessment,” Smidt said.
Michael Miller, associate professor of political science at Barnard College, said it is not common for states to release these kinds of reports, particularly so many months after an election.
But Benander, the Benson spokesperson, said it was “quite a stretch to claim a political motive” for the timing of the release.
“When dealing with so many different data points, it takes time and effort to make sure everything is accurate,” Benander said in an email. “Last year around this time, we released a similar county-by-county report on 2022 youth turnout. We’re always looking for ways to share election data and information in ways that are accessible to Michiganders.”
One possible reason Michigan’s had higher participation in 2024 while other states saw a decrease from 2020’s record turnout is that swing state voters believe their votes matter more, Miller said. Michigan is often important in determining who wins the presidency, and the close 2020 result likely reinforced that view.
“If you live in West Virginia or North Dakota, you have a pretty good inkling of how the election is going to go,” he said.
Turnout was also likely up because Michigan got a lot of attention from both major presidential campaigns, in terms of visits and advertising, Miller said.
“Battleground voters love to bask in attention,” he added.

“That’s a significant amount of money,” said Sen. Greg Hertz, a Polson Republican and outgoing chairman of the Revenue Interim Committee.
The Revenue Interim Committee heard the estimate at a meeting Friday, one week after President Donald Trump signed the exhaustive tax cuts and spending legislation.
After the meeting, however, Hertz said the state of Montana is on track to collect more than $100 million on top of its estimated revenue.
“So those two will kind of offset,” Hertz said.
Research analyst Megan Moore reviewed the different changes and costs outlined in a Legislative Fiscal Division memo.
Moore said the memo focused on individual income tax provisions. She said the state links to federal taxable income for its own income tax purposes.
“So some of the changes made in that federal legislation are going to flow through automatically to Montana, barring any changes by the Legislature,” Moore said.
The following changes that will make up most of the annual $114.2 million deficit are retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025, according to the Legislative Fiscal Division:

An increase in the standard deduction by $750 for single filers and $1,500 for joint filers will result in $23.4 million in lost revenue to Montana. Changes also include making the larger standard deduction permanent.
An enhanced deduction for seniors who are 65 or older of $6,000 will cost $35.6 million. It is allowed through tax year 2028.
A car loan interest deduction for auto loans bought for personal use will cost $6.6 million. It’s allowed only through 2028. The vehicle must be new, and it must have “final assembly” completed in the U.S.
No tax on tips, allowed through 2028, will cost $4 million. That’s for qualified tips up to a maximum $25,000 received.
No tax on overtime compensation is estimated to cost $37 million and is allowed through 2028.

The memo also estimates a charitable deduction for filers who do not itemize that takes effect on Jan. 1, 2026, will cost $7.5 million a year and is a permanent change. The deduction is up to $1,000 per person or $2,000 for joint filers.
However, the memo said only limited data is available for Montana on car loan interest and overtime hours.
Rep. Mark Thane, a Missoula Democrat, said he would like to know how the drop impacts the bottom line budget for the state.
An economist from the Department of Revenue said he did not yet have the information.
A staff member with the Legislative Fiscal Division said he anticipates the analysis will be part of the information being compiled following the close of the most recent fiscal year.
After the meeting, Hertz said as Montana continues to grow, he believes growth in revenue will offset the money lost to the Big Beautiful Bill.
He also said the Legislature helped by not dropping income tax rates a whole point as Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte wanted — he wanted a top rate of 4.9% but lawmakers settled on 5.4%.
The federal legislation will impact dollars for Medicaid and SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, but Hertz said the revenue committee won’t review those items, although he believes other legislative committees will.

(Photo by Bretwood Higman, Erin McKittrick/Ground Truth Trekking via Creative Commons license)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a rare step under former President Joe Biden to block development of the Pebble mine — Alaska’s largest known copper and gold deposit, which for years has fueled controversy over its potential impacts on one of the world’s largest salmon runs.
Now, under President Donald Trump, the agency is giving its past Pebble decisions another look and negotiating a deal that could end a lawsuit filed by Pebble’s developer — an announcement that’s boosted the company’s stock price this week.
Administration officials “have been actively considering the agency decisions” and are “open to reconsideration,” according to a recent court filing submitted by U.S. Department of Justice lawyers. The three-page document does not elaborate, though it references the past decision by the EPA and a separate decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deny Pebble a key permit.
The Trump administration is now negotiating a potential settlement to a lawsuit that challenged the decision — a case filed last year by Pebble Limited Partnership, the project’s developer — the document added.
Pebble’s chief executive, John Shively, said that a settlement could result in the withdrawal of the EPA’s preemptive veto of mining activity in the project area. The proposed mine would be built in the Bristol Bay region, in the headwaters of the world’s largest sockeye salmon run.
A reversal of the veto would amount to a stunning shift in momentum for the Pebble project, which seemed all but dead after the EPA decision two years ago. The project would still face major obstacles to its construction, including the 2020 denial of the key wetlands permit by the Army Corps.
Pebble appealed the wetlands permit decision, but the Army Corps last year rejected the appeal, citing the EPA’s 2023 veto.
Pebble sued both the EPA and the Army Corps.
A reversal of the EPA decision would give the developers “an opportunity to go back to the Corps,” said Shively. He declined to share additional details about a possible settlement.
The stock price of Northern Dynasty Minerals, Pebble’s publicly traded, Vancouver-based parent company, rose by more than 50% in the past week — a likely sign of investors’ enthusiasm about a possible settlement.
Pebble would be one of the world’s largest copper, gold and molybdenum mines. Boosters, including Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and two local Indigenous-owned corporations, say it could create much-needed jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the state and rural Alaskans.
But the Bristol Bay region is also home to a prolific sockeye salmon run, which sustains rural subsistence fishermen and an annual commercial harvest worth more than $100 million. The proposed mine faces broad local, statewide and national opposition from fishermen, tribal governments, Bristol Bay’s regional Alaska Native-owned corporation and environmental groups.
“The legal, administrative, and public record, really, over and over and over again proves that this type of mining and mine does not belong in Bristol Bay,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, a regional tribal consortium that fiercely opposes Pebble.
“This is something we’ve been fighting for decades, and it’s just going to be devastating yet again to be put through the rigamarole of a potential settlement,” said Hurley, reached by phone this week from her fish camp on the shores of Nushagak Bay, downstream of the Pebble deposit.
Given its size and proximity to the Bristol Bay fishery, Pebble critics include figures typically supportive of resource development, like Alaska’s two Republican U.S. senators. Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and even Donald Trump Jr., who is known to fish recreationally in the region, have also expressed concerns.
Trump’s first administration initially appeared more supportive of the project, undoing efforts by the Obama administration to block mine development. But in 2020, after an outpouring of public opposition — including from Republicans like Trump Jr. — the Army Corps denied Pebble’s application for a Clean Water Act permit.
In a court filing late last year, Pebble’s lawyers argued that the Army Corps’ decision “was likely due to political interference” by Trump Jr. and “his friends, and substantial political contributors to President Trump’s reelection.”
Soon after the start of Trump’s second term, Justice Department lawyers and Pebble agreed to pause the litigation while government officials caught up on the case. Some close observers of the project noted that Trump’s new chief of staff, Susie Wiles, once worked as a lobbyist for Pebble.
The EPA declined to answer questions from Northern Journal this week.
“At this time, our understanding is that there may be an updated submission made to EPA for consideration, but there is nothing currently before the agency to that effect,” Molly Vaseliou, the EPA’s associate administrator for public affairs, said in an emailed statement.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The State University System Board of Governors moved forward Friday on creating a new university accreditation agency, even as the board’s chair acknowledged a “lot of questions” about liability, organizational structure, and the intent of the agency. 
The Commission for Public Higher Education, intended by Gov. Ron DeSantis to “upend” “woke accreditation cartels,” got a go-ahead from the board during a longer-than-expected meeting filled with questions about governance and how the organization will come to be.
DeSantis announced the initiative last month as a partnership among southern states that he complains have had to “bend the knee” to secure or maintain accreditation under the existing setup.
DeSantis developing new university accreditor to ‘upend’ ‘woke accreditation cartels’

Board Chair Brian Lamb said there are a “lot of questions” still to answer about operating the agency, as did board member Eric Silagy. 
“We need to be very thoughtful and I think deliberate in standing this up, because it is truly a startup that right off the bat will have millions of students and hundreds of thousands of faculty and billions of dollars directly affiliated with it,” Silagy said.
The board approved a business plan, bylaws, and articles of incorporation for the organization, which has initial buy-in from the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, University of South Carolina, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system.
The business plan looks at the pathway to being an official accreditor, plus market analysis, revenue model, risk analysis, and other state objectives. 
Acting as the Board of Governors Foundation, too, the board approved $4 million toward the agency.
“If you look at the current accreditation process utilized by the seven national accreditors, they are all focused on inputs and processes rather than outputs and outcomes. This approach, we believe, suppresses innovation and it punishes those who try to do things differently,” SUS Chancellor Ray Rodrigues said.
How much control the Board of Governors might exercise over the new accreditor, funding commitments from other states, and data security were among the top concerns voiced by board members in the early stages of the accrediting agency.
The process to be officially recognized by the U.S. Department of Education is expected to take about two years, although the state points out an executive order from President Donald Trump that looks to address GOP concerns with accreditation agencies that may speed up the process. 
Future funding for the agency is unsettled, according to Lamb, while board staff said it has internal approximations but nothing they felt comfortable making public.

Looking to replace
Florida’s and other southern state institutions are members of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. During a news conference last month announcing Florida’s new commission, DeSantis and Rodrigues launched jabs at SACSCOC, saying Florida institutions have problems with the accrediting organization and that its member schools’ performance has not been impressive.
SACSCOC told the Phoenix, “We welcome any new accreditor as they go through a rigorous approval process. Accreditation is central to quality education; thus accreditors are held to high standards and must themselves be reviewed.”
The statement continued: “As for SACSCOC, we know we currently accredit institutions that serve the largest number of students in the country (approximately 5M). As such, we will work with our partnering institutions to ensure and strengthen a high standard of accreditation that reflects the needs of students, our institutions, and the workforce.”
The governor has identified existing accrediting agencies as being an “issue for a long time” as an impediment to higher education policies he’s championed, such as SB 266, which outlawed state spending on diversity, equity, and inclusion but allowed DEI initiatives to continue if required to maintain accreditation. 
Rodrigues said he wants ideology out of the accrediting process. 
“We’re not looking to create an accreditor that removes left-wing ideology and replaces it with right-wing ideology. The point of this is to have an accreditor that’s not involved in ideology at all but is completely focused on academic excellence and quality education,” Rodrigues said.
The Florida Education Association and United Faculty of Florida released a joint statement following DeSantis’ announcement last month, saying they “strongly oppose” the move that they believe “directly threatens the independence, integrity, and academic credibility of the state’s higher education system.”
“Accreditation matters because it’s the backbone of academic freedom, shared governance, and public trust in the quality of our institutions,” UFF President Teresa M. Hodge said in a news release, adding that the proposed accreditor “appears designed to align more with political priorities rather than academic independence.”

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Groups submitting comments on the latest stage of the Line 5 oil pipeline project in Michigan argue the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has failed to complete adequate analyses of climate change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions.
On May 30, the Corps’ Detroit district released its draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Enbridge Energy Line 5 Tunnel Project, in which energy company Enbridge would construct a 3.6-mile tunnel under the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac that would house a replacement segment of Line 5, through which Enbridge transports 540,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas liquids.
However, experts from the Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC) and the Michigan Climate Action Network (MiCAN), which submitted joint comments on the project on June 30, argue that the draft EIS is inadequate, failing to take climate change into consideration and overlooking potential harms of the project.
“The biggest thing is that the Corps decided to entirely exclude any considerations of greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts that are associated with the tunnel project, and their reasoning for doing this was that it’s consistent with the executive order that President Trump issued earlier this year,” said Ellis Walton, an associate attorney at ELPC.
ELPC argued that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires a deeper review than the Corps completed.
“NEPA the statute, as well as NEPA precedent … has established that federal agencies should be looking at foreseeable effects of major federal actions, and it’s pretty foreseeable that a tunnel project that extends the lifeline of [an oil] pipeline would have foreseeable climate impacts and foreseeably contribute to greenhouse gases and climate change,” Walton said. “It’s so important for the Corps to analyze these climate impacts and understand how we may be harming environmental quality now as well as in the future.”
The country is in a moment of rapid upending of environmental rules that experts warn will harm Americans’ health and limit public participation in government decisions. Some of the changes affect NEPA, passed in 1970 and often called the “Magna Carta” of U.S. environmental law. Changes to NEPA rules were issued in late June by agencies including the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, Interior, Defense and Transportation “to simplify this overly burdensome process and ensure efficient and timely environmental reviews,” the White House said in a statement at the time.
That comes on the heels of a May 29 U.S. Supreme Court decision that gives the federal government more power to decide what to focus on in a NEPA review—and what to leave out. “Courts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote.
Keele and Walton said their groups are still reviewing the changes, but both expressed confidence that earlier precedents on NEPA will provide stable grounds for arguing against the project.
Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy said the company supports and welcomes the public comment process now underway. “Public and stakeholder input is essential to the integrity of this process, and we look forward to hearing feedback, answering questions, and continuing to engage transparently with all interested parties,” Duffy said in a statement.
White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said that the project is part of the Trump administration’s promise to unleash American energy to promote the economy and security while protecting natural resources. “Line 5 is great for families in Michigan and Wisconsin, who benefit from quality jobs within the energy industry and lower costs from expanded pipelines,” Kelly said in a statement.
In comments to Inside Climate News, the Corps reiterated that it removed the topics of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change from the draft EIS in accordance with the executive orders.
The Corps has said since 2023 that it would not evaluate climate impacts from the extraction and use of the pipeline’s products in its EIS of the Line 5 project. Although it initially said it would evaluate emissions from tunnel construction and operation, no such evaluation appears in the current draft EIS.
In that draft, the agency says greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and environmental justice are “Not Applicable” for the draft EIS because of Trump’s Jan. 20 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order and his move to rescind executive orders signed by Democratic presidents.
In the Corps’ executive summary of the draft EIS, the terms “climate change” and “greenhouse gas emissions” do not appear at all (although the term “emissions” is included, in each case related to local air quality).
Denise Keele, executive director of MiCAN, said her group argues that the energy crisis cited in Trump’s executive order is not a true emergency. “The last time we checked, our fossil fuel industry was making record profits, and I don’t think there’s an emergency in getting fossil fuels out of the ground,” Keele said, adding that the “real emergency” is the potential impacts of climate change on human health and the environment that could result if the project is constructed.
The Corps also cited Trump’s order in April when announcing a truncated timeline for public comment on the project and its draft EIS, giving groups less time to review the statement and submit robust comments on it.
The normal comment period is 60 days, and for a project this big it is usually extended up to 90, Keele said. In this case, the period was 30 days.
The Line 5 tunnel project has been under scrutiny from lawmakers, environmentalists and tribes in the Great Lakes region for over a decade. In 2020, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered the Department of Natural Resources to revoke the permit allowing Enbridge to operate its dual pipelines in the Straits. Enbridge challenged that decision with a lawsuit filed the same year. Attorneys for the state are still seeking to dismiss the challenge.
Another ongoing case, filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in 2019 against Enbridge, argues the 1953 permit for Line 5 was never valid. On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would take up the case to determine whether it belongs in state or federal court. Duffy said Enbridge is looking forward to the high court’s review.
Keele said another concern is the precedent that the project could set should it move forward. If the project is approved without proper analyses of climate change, other companies may have more leeway to cite the project and executive order as reasons for why NEPA considerations aren’t necessary, she said.
Meanwhile, Keele said, Michigan has been prioritizing a renewable energy economy—it set a goal to generate 60 percent of state electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Moving forward with Line 5, she said, would go against the state’s efforts to phase out fossil fuels.
“Michigan already knows it doesn’t want to suffer those climate impacts, and we’re moving in the other direction,” Keele said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2901-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-12 11:10:25.639238

Megan Dean, the departing commanding officer, during a change of command ceremony Friday, July 11, 2025, in Juneau. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Last week, President Donald Trump signed a budget bill with almost $25 billion for new Coast Guard construction, including almost $9 billion for new icebreakers and $300 million for new Coast Guard facilities in Juneau.
On Friday, Rear Adm. Bob Little, the new commander of the Coast Guard in Alaska, said it remains to be seen how those new ships will be used and when they will arrive in the Arctic.
“What I hope is, regardless of where in the service that capacity ends up, is that it will overall increase the capacity for the Coast Guard and that the Arctic District can certainly benefit from that increased capacity,” he said.
Until last week, the Coast Guard’s Alaska force was known as District 17. As part of a nationwide renaming project, it’s now the Coast Guard Arctic District. In a ceremony held at Juneau, Little took command of the newly renamed district from Rear Adm. Megan Dean, who has been assigned to Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C.
“It’s a change in name, but our missions, our priorities remain the same,” Little said.
Alaska has the largest commercial fishing fleet in the United States and produces more than half of the nation’s seafood. Key maritime trade routes between Asia and California run through Alaska waters, and cruise ships carry more than 1.5 million passengers through Southeast Alaska each year.
Altogether, the Coast Guard employs almost 2,500 people, including almost 2,000 active-duty Sentinels, as active-duty members are formally known.

Speaking at the ceremony, the head of the Coast Guard in the Pacific Ocean, Vice Adm. Andrew Tiongson, noted that it has been an extraordinarily busy year for the agency, which responded to fishing disasters, medical emergencies, foreign ships near American waters, and the recent sinking of a cargo ship carrying 3,000 cars.
Last year, the Coast Guard responded to 16 cases of foreign ships approaching the international border near Alaska, Tiongson said, calling it “the most significant foreign military presence in our waters near Alaska … in decades.”
Tiongson, who will retire later this month, said he expects the number of foreign ships near Alaska to grow.
Both China and Russia have sailed military ships through international waters near Alaska recently as part of freedom-of-navigation missions to demonstrate their right to travel through international waterways. The United States conducts similar missions near both countries.
Foreign fishing vessels frequently catch fish near the international boundary that marks the economic activity zone between Russia and the United States.
“We have an obligation to be present and to push back, to deter or deny malign activity anywhere that we have sovereign U.S. rights, and in the Arctic District, we have a lot of those and a lot of interest,” Little said.
Right now, the big budget bill isn’t expected to bring immediate help for the Coast Guard in dealing with those issues.
The Coast Guard’s Polar Security Cutter program, which received $4.3 billion under the federal budget bill, isn’t expected to deliver its first new ship until 2030 at the earliest.
When that ship, the Polar Sentinel, arrives in service, it likely will replace the Polar Star, which was commissioned in 1976 and is primarily used to keep open the sea lanes to American research stations in Antarctica.
Additional ships are expected in the following years.
The budget bill also contains $3.5 billion for a new Arctic Security Cutter program, which seeks to launch a lighter icebreaker within three years of a contract being awarded.
That ship, according to published specifications, would only be able to break ice up to 3 feet thick, less than the capability of the Coast Guard’s sole medium icebreaker, the Healy, and equivalent to a Class-5 icebreaker, second-lowest on the six-level international standards rankings.
The bill also contains $816 million to procure additional, unspecified light and medium icebreaking cutters. 
That could involve buying and converting commercial ships.
Next month, the Coast Guard is expected to commission the icebreaker Storis in Juneau. That ship was formerly the Arctic oil drilling support ship Aiviq but was purchased by the Coast Guard as an interim icebreaking solution.
Speaking Friday, Little confirmed that the Storis will be operating on a more limited basis until it undergoes a comprehensive refit.
“She’ll be transitioning from kind of an initial operating capability into what we’ll eventually consider full operational capability,” he said. “But that doesn’t diminish the fact that we’ll have a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, painted red with a Coast Guard stripe, operating in the region this summer.”
The budget bill includes $300 million to construct a new port and support facilities in Juneau to support the Storis, but Little said he didn’t have any information Friday on the timeline for construction and development.
For this summer, he said, the plan is to “limit the mission space” for the Storis until its crew and the Coast Guard are familiar with the ship.
“We’ll step into that very thoughtfully,” he said.
Friday’s ceremony didn’t include as much discussion of aviation. The budget bill includes $2.3 billion for up to 40 new MH-60 helicopters, the long-distance workhorses of Coast Guard heliborne aviation. 
It also allocates $1.1 billion for six new HC-130J fixed-wing aircraft. In Alaska, five of those aircraft are based at Kodiak and used for extremely long-range search-and-rescue missions, as well as “Arctic domain” flights that can involve flights along the American border in the Arctic Ocean.
The budget bill also contains $2.2 billion for new maintenance facilities nationally, $4.4 billion for shoreside facilities — including the $300 million for Juneau — and $266 million for long-range drone aircraft, an under-developed area for the Coast Guard.
Little said that kind of spending is a “fundamental change” for the Coast Guard, whose annual budget is only about $14 billion. 
Coming into his new job, he said he’s aware that as ship traffic increases in the Arctic Ocean and surrounding waters, there are “increased risks, increased commercial traffic, increased tourist traffic, cruise ships, and increased access to what were otherwise hard-to-access waters.”
The risk of a “no-notice incident that we might have to respond to — and it might be a large incident in a more remote area than we’re accustomed to operating, that would be the thing that would maybe keep you up at night.”

ZEELAND — Howard Miller, a staple in the Zeeland community for almost a century, is going to shut down its plant, and more than 100 employees there will lose their jobs as a result.
The manufacturing company cited a struggling housing market, the current inflation problem and the crushing tariffs under the Trump administration as reasons for shutting down.
Howard Miller representatives released a news release on Thursday, July 10, announcing its “plans to wind down its manufacturing operations.” Production is expected to continue into the fourth quarter of this year, with the company remaining open into 2026 to sell its inventory of quality finished goods, the company’s statement said.
The manufacturing giant has two Michigan plants in Zeeland and Traverse City, and one in North Carolina, employing a combined 195 people. Zeeland employs around 130 people at its plant.
According to the news release, company leaders say, “a convergence of market influences beyond our control brought us to this point. Furniture sales are closely linked to the health of the housing market, which is struggling. Our hopes for a market recovery early in the year were quickly dashed as tariffs rattled the supply chain, sparked recession fears and pushed mortgage rates higher. The furniture industry continues to shed jobs and announce plant closings.”
The statement continued, saying: “Our business has been directly impacted by tariffs that have increased the cost of essential components unavailable domestically and driven specialty suppliers out of business, making it unsustainable for us to continue our operations.”
Zeeland City Manager Tim Klunder said the city was made aware on Tuesday evening, and city officials were saddened to learn of their impending departure.
“It’s a sad day in the community. They are very symbolic in our community,” he said. “This certainly isn’t something you hope to prepare for.”
 A ‘great’ community partner

Howard Miller — a third-generation family-owned business known for its handcrafted clocks and better-end home furnishings — has a larger-than-life presence in the community that extends far beyond being an employer, Klunder said.
There are plaques located throughout the city, and there is the Howard Miller Community Center, located in downtown Zeeland, that has five rental rooms available. The center hosts events including wedding receptions, open houses, craft shows, bridal showers, holiday banquets and family gatherings.
The Holland Miller Public Library, 14 S. Church St., has for years offered free materials and programming for children, teens and adults.
Klunder said it’s a huge loss for the Zeeland community and he is grateful for what the company has brought to it.
“I’m thankful for the tremendous impact they have on our community. They have been a great community partner,” he said.
 Next steps

Employees, distributors and customers of Herman Miller shared the news with its employees on Wednesday. Employees will receive a severance package as well as support with job placement, according to the company press release.
Company leaders say they will “continue to fulfill its philanthropic mission and its longstanding commitment to nonprofits along the Lakeshore.”
“We are incredibly disappointed to have reached this point in our journey,” according to Howard J. “Buzz” Miller, grandson of the company founder who now serves as president and CEO.
“For nearly a century, we have manufactured clocks, custom cabinets and other furniture designed to enhance the lives of our customers at home. We’ve been blessed with an incredible workforce of skilled craftspeople and professionals who enabled our company to grow and prosper for decades.”
Miller said the company has been working with an investment banker to market itself, but has been unable to find a buyer. Howard Miller would still entertain offers from an interested buyer, the press release stated.
Howard Miller got its start in 1926 by Howard C. Miller, son of office furniture manufacturing legend Herman Miller. Initially, Howard Miller crafted fine chiming wall and mantel clocks designed to last generations, expanding over the decades to add grandfather clocks, curio cabinets, entertainment centers and more.
In 1983, Howard Miller purchased Hekman Furniture Co., which will also be closing as part of this wind-down.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states, including Iowa, have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”

– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, and the office eventually resumed funding.
Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s three biggest cities have the highest health care costs among the nation’s urban areas, with costs that are about 50% higher than the U.S. urban average, a state analysis shows.
The findings, part of a broader analysis of Alaska’s cost of living that was released by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, are the latest in a series of reports detailing Alaska’s extraordinarily high medical costs.
“It was not surprising at all,” said Sam Tappen, the state economist who did the analysis. His findings are in an article in the current issue of Alaska Economic Trends, the monthly magazine of the department’s research section.
Similar analysis has shown that Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks have held the top three spots for urban health costs in each of the past 15 years, he said.
Using available data, Tappen found that Fairbanks had health costs that were 51.5% higher in 2024 than the average among 254 U.S. cities and metro areas. Juneau was in second at 50.9% and Anchorage third at 47.5% above the urban average.
Medical costs in urban Alaska also rose more than the costs in almost all other sectors, Tappen’s analysis found. Medical costs increased by 7.8% in 2023, compared with an overall inflation rate in Alaska that was under 2% that year and just slightly above 2% in 2024, the analysis found.
Compared to the U.S. average, urban Alaskans also devote a higher percentage of their annual household spending to medical care – 12% in 2023, compared to a national average of 8%, the report said.
The findings, which did not extend to health costs in rural areas of the state, are consistent with past reports on medical costs in Alaska.
In 2016, for example, a consultant’s report prepared for insurer Premera Blue Cross found that payments to Alaska providers were 76% higher than the national average and that operating costs for hospitals outside of Anchorage were more than twice the national average.
Reports by the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage have also documented steep increases in Alaska health care costs. One ISER report, issued in 2018, found that annual health care spending in Alaska increased from $1.5 billion in 1991 to $8.2 billion in 2014. A 2023 report by ISER, ranked Alaska second in per-capita health care spending, behind the District of Columbia, and said Alaska’s total health care spending had risen to $9.7 billion by 2019.
Beyond medical costs, Tappen’s analysis showed that Fairbanks had the highest utility costs among the 254 cities and urban areas in the analysis. Utility costs in Fairbanks in 2024 were more than twice the U.S. urban average, the analysis said.
The three Alaska cities also had among the highest U.S. urban grocery costs, with Juneau ranking second, Fairbanks third and Anchorage fourth. Honolulu had the highest average grocery costs of the 254 cities in the analysis.
Overall, the Alaska cities’ cost of living, though 21.5% to 27.2% higher than the national urban average, was not extraordinary in 2024, Tappen’s analysis found.
That is because housing costs in Alaska that once were among the nation’s highest have now been far surpassed by those in several cities elsewhere. “The U.S. housing market has just been a lot hotter than Alaska’s, and so they’re getting more expensive faster than us,” Tappen said.

U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, who first came to the forefront in the Watergate hearings, became the first African-American woman to deliver the keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. 
In high school, she heard a career day speech by Edith Sampson, a black lawyer. Sampson’s words inspired her to become an attorney, and she attended Texas Southern University, a black college hastily created by the Texas Legislature to avoid having to integrate the University of Texas. While there, she became part of the debate team, which famously tied Harvard University debaters. 
After graduating magna cum laude in 1956, she was accepted at Boston University’s law school. After graduating, she returned to Houston to open a law office in the Fifth Ward. In 1972, she became the first black woman from the South to be elected to Congress. Four years later, she told those at the Democratic National Convention, “We are a people in a quandary about the present. We are a people in search of our future. We are a people in search of a national community. We are a people trying not only to solve the problems of the present, unemployment, inflation, but we are attempting on a larger scale to fulfill the promise of America. We are attempting to fulfill our national purpose, to create and sustain a society in which all of us are equal. … 
“Many fear the future. Many are distrustful of their leaders and believe that their voices are never heard. Many seek only to satisfy their private work — wants; to satisfy their private interests. But this is the great danger America faces — that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups: city against suburb, region against region, individual against individual; each seeking to satisfy private wants. If that happens, who then will speak for America? Who then will speak for the common good? … 
“We cannot improve on the system of government handed down to us by the founders of the Republic. There is no way to improve upon that. But what we can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize our destiny.” 
Her own destiny had been impacted a few years earlier when she was diagnosed with the debilitating disease of multiple sclerosis. In 1979, she stepped away from politics and began teaching at the University of Texas. She delivered the keynote address again in 1992, this time from a wheelchair. Not long after, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 1996, she died of pneumonia and leukemia.

So, we asked it: “How many state employees does Idaho have?”
The chatbot’s answer didn’t make sense. The tool falsely claimed nearly a third of Idaho’s over 2 million population works for the state.
“Idaho has approximately 713,015 state employees as indicated by the most recent data available,” the chatbot replied.
The right answer, though, depends on how you ask the question.
When you ask more specifically about how many “active” state employees there are, Idaho HR Administrator Janelle White explained, you can get a better answer.
“Idaho currently has approximately 23,546 active state employees employed across various government agencies,” the chatbot replied, according to a screenshot she shared with the Idaho Capital Sun.
The chatbot is one of the few ways Idaho state government agencies are already using AI. But with high interest — and concern — from state agencies and employees, Idaho’s Office of Information Technology Services is preparing a yearslong plan with guidance on how to responsibly use AI in state government.
  (Screenshot)
“While we’re measuring and mitigating risks, we’re making sure that we’re not getting in the way of it being launched. We want to — we really want to unleash this to the workforce,” Idaho Office of Information Technology Services Administrator Alberto Gonzalez said in an interview. “I’m a huge fan of automation and machine learning already anyways, because it can make government way more effective and more efficient. And I believe that those that are not using automation are doing a disservice to the state.”
By August, Idaho agencies could start using tools like ChatGPT
By August, Gonzalez said Idaho state government agencies can start using publicly available tools like ChatGPT or Gemini in public facing chatbots, which have been largely blocked. 
To him, the use cases for AI in state government are “endless.” The technology can be used for routine tasks, like customer service and data entry, to quicken time-intensive reports, and even to detect fraud, waste and abuse, he said.
One of the biggest AI concerns for state employees is how widely data can be accessed, or data governance, Gonzalez said. That’s part of what goes into the IT office’s work with state agencies to prepare them to roll out AI tools.
Some national experts also say AI could reduce the workforce. That could be true, Gonzalez acknowledged, but it would take a while.
Using the technology more could mean agencies automate more tasks to free staff time up, he said. “So then you can use that staff to do something — either slow down the growth, so that you don’t have to grow government … or potentially through attrition, you could reduce the workforce by leveraging AI,” Gonzalez said.
“I know that that’s a more sensitive topic, but I’m talking over years,” he said.
Last month, the agency announced the guidance to state lawmakers at the Idaho Legislature’s AI Working Group. But the guidance hasn’t been shared with agencies yet while it’s under legal review. The Idaho Capital Sun obtained a copy of the draft guidance through a public records request.
Idaho would carefully roll out, refine AI tools over two years, under draft plan
The draft AI guidance lays out a four-step plan — over two years — to implement AI in Idaho state government agencies.
First, Idaho would set up a foundation — establishing structures to govern AI use, roles for state agencies and departments, oversight and more.
Then, Idaho would initially implement AI in pilot runs. Later, Idaho would expand implementation and continue to fine tune AI’s use in state government.
“Idaho’s tiered guidance model applies rigorous scrutiny to high-risk systems and streamlines review for low-risk applications,” the draft guidance’s introduction reads. “This structure empowers the state to capture immediate value from early implementations and build institutional capacity systematically. Through this balanced approach, Idaho is poised to transform its citizen services, operational workflows, and decision-making culture, anchoring it in data-driven insights and public accountability.”
And building trust is one of the main goals.
“Every AI system will meet clear standards for explainability, auditability, and ethical alignment,” a short summary of the guidance reads. “Transparency isn’t optional, it’s foundational.”
Congress ditched 10-year ban on state AI regulations. Idaho has three AI laws.
Initially, Congress’s massive federal spending and tax cut bill that became law last week would’ve blocked states from regulating AI through state laws for 10 years. But the U.S. Senate nearly unanimously removed the moratorium, States Newsroom reported.
In 2024, Idaho passed three laws to regulate AI — targeting explicit and political deep fakes, and AI-generated material that is exploitative of children.
At the Legislature’s AI work group’s meeting last month, the Idaho Office of Information Technology Services shared copies of its draft AI guidance with state lawmakers for review.
The Idaho HR AI chatbot still can’t tell you the number of state employees
For the rollout of the public HR chatbot, the Idaho Division of Human Resources worked with the Office of Information Technology Services, White told the Sun.
The Sun sent her a screenshot of the chatbot appearing to wildly overestimate Idaho’s state employee workforce. She, and the Idaho DMV administrator, both suggested they would’ve asked it differently — with more specific details, like asking for the active workforce.
“The information provided by the chatbot will only be as good as the question asked [and the information it has access to],” White said in an email on Monday. “… Part of the learning curve with AI and chatbots, is being really good at asking questions!”
But on Tuesday, when the Sun asked the chatbot the same question White asked, the chatbot couldn’t answer.
“I don’t have the current number of active state employees available,” it said.
Idaho DMV is using an AI chatbot. But only for internal testing right now.
The Idaho Department of Motor Vehicles, or DMV, is also using an AI-powered chatbot as part of a pilot project. But the tool is only available for some DMV employees to use for testing — and is not yet open to the public, officials say.
It won’t go public until it’s refined, Idaho DMV Administrator Lisa McClellan told the Sun in an interview.
“Until it’s ready for prime time, we won’t even use it internally in our production environment,” she said.
Drawing from internal policy documents, manuals and Idaho state laws, the tool is meant to quicken the process of searching through reams of information, she explained. The tool doesn’t have access to any personally identifiable information, she said.
Only a handful of ITD employees, who mostly already know the answers to the questions they ask the tool, are using it, McClellan said. Right now, they’re testing how accurate its answers are, and learning how to best ask questions to get correct answers, she said.

Four years and 15 days ago, in Omaha at the College World Series, Brayland Skinner was a human blur.
The score was tied at three apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning when Skinner entered the game as a pinch runner for Mississippi State against mighty Texas. First, Skinner stole second base easily. Yogi Berra, himself, couldn’t have thrown him out. One pitch later, Skinner sprinted home with the winning run on Tanner Leggett’s sharp single to vault the Bulldogs into the CWS championship series against Vanderbilt. Skinner slid into the plate but he didn’t have to do so. Willie Mays couldn’t have thrown him out.
And you know what happened over the next three days. State won it all. Skinner and Leggett, who had been teammates at Northwest Community College, were two the most unlikely heroes. “My juco bandits,” Chris Lemonis called them.

Rick Cleveland 
So I was telling Mississippi Mud Monsters manager Jay Pecci that story Thursday night about how Skinner, a reserve outfielder from Lake Cormorant, had been one of the stars of State’s amazing College World Series championship run.
“Well, Brayland is my hero now,” Pecci responded. “He was the first player I signed when I got this job back in January. He’s been one of best players, a key to the success we’ve had. He’s not only an outstanding player, but he’s a first-class person, one of our leaders. He hustles all the time. He does a little of everything and he does it all well.”
Pecci told a story about a postgame dugout scene after a tough Mud Monsters loss a couple weeks ago. “They walked us off and all everybody was moping around, all in the dumps, and then I look around and there Brayland is, cleaning up the trash in the dugout. He just does what he is supposed to do,” Pecci said.
Skinner, the team’s leadoff hitter and centerfielder, is hitting .286 with eight doubles, two triples and two home runs. His singles often turn into doubles because he leads the team with 27 stolen bases. And as good as he has been offensively, his range in centerfield has been equally impressive. Many of his catches have been ESPN SportsCenter Play of the Day quality, including this one in which he dove over the wall to complete a long-running catch. Of course, SportsCenter does not choose many of its highlights from the Frontier League.
Some background is probably necessary here because some readers might not know a Mud Monster from Muddy Waters. The Mississippi Mud Monsters are a professional baseball team in the Pioneer League, an independent league team loosely affiliated with Major League Baseball. They play home games in Pearl at Trustmark Park, former home of the Mississippi Braves. Often, they play before small crowds. They average just over 2,000 customers per game. On special promotions nights, such as the July 4 fireworks night, they’ll go over 5,000.
Put it this way: The owners, nor the players, are getting rich. It’s a bus league, and the bus rides are long. The Mud Monsters play in the West Division Midwest Conference of the Frontier League with teams mostly located in suburban Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis.
“The bus rides can be a grind, but it’s baseball,” Skinner said. “The competition in this league is good. There are some dudes who can really throw it. I have been surprised by how good this league is.”
Four years ago. Brayland Skinner was helping Mississippi Statewide a national championship. Here, he reacts after stealing second base in the ninth inning/ pf a 3-3 game with Texas.

Skinner played his last season at State in 2022 and upon his graduation with a business degree, he transferred to Memphis where he played one season as graduate student and hit .270 as a full-time starter. He spent 2024 playing for a California team in the Pioneer League, another independent baseball league. Skinner hit .298 and stole 48 bases in 90 games. When the chance came to return to Mississippi and continue to play baseball, he jumped at it.
The Mud Monsters, who did not have a player or a coach six months ago, have won eight of their last nine games, including a 4-2 victory Thursday night ($2 beer night) before a crowd of 2,386. The current home stand continues through Sunday night. Monday is a travel day before the Monsters begin series at Florence, Kentucky (a Cincinnati suburb) and then Schaumburg, Illinois (a Chicago suburb).
“I think we are playing our best ball right now,” Skinner said. “We were all so new to one another, but we’ve bonded together pretty well. We’re winning.”
Independent professional baseball, such as the Frontier League, is peppered with players who have elite talent in one facet of the sport, but lack the overall skill level to make it to the a Major Leagues. For instance, Skinner has Big League speed, base running abilities and defensive range, but lacks the power — “the pop,” as they say — that Major League teams seek from outfielders. Pitcher Michael Fowler, who recently joined the Mud Monsters from Southern Miss, has Big League velocity and stuff, but needs to refine his pitching skills and control.
More than 1,000 players Frontier League have signed contracts with MLB farm systems over the years. A minuscule percentage have made it all the way to the highest level.
“There’s always a shot,” said Skinner, who will turn 26 later this month and knows his is a very long shot. “I know I’m playing right now mostly for the love of the game and I know there’s going to come a time when I have to quit playing. But right now, I’m still trying to go out there every night and try to help my team win and try to get better. I still love playing this game.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/10190334/Brayland-Skinner.jpg,,,2025-07-12 07:59:50.857582

From a map drawn on a bison pelt by Native American tribes to Bob Christiansen’s 1:125,000 scale map published in 2001, the resolution of Yellowstone maps only continues to evolve. Although these maps — especially those that show the geology — have created a solid foundation for tourists and researchers alike, many remote or poorly exposed areas of Yellowstone have been generalized at broad scales, now requiring geologists to revisit these regions.
Fixing Yellowstone: How an intact ecosystem set the stage for a wolf queen’s long reign

Their goal? To improve our understanding of all rocks that make up Yellowstone’s geologic history. But what happens when a rock previously mapped as a younger eruption is dated using new techniques and returns an age that doesn’t match anything in the geologic record? This is exactly what happened recently, when Montana State University geologists identified a new geological unit in the west part of Yellowstone National Park.
Yellowstone’s landscape tells a story written in ash, lava and time. Scientists have worked to understand that story by mapping volcanic rocks and using tools like argon dating on individual minerals to determine when eruptions occurred.
Our current maps have identified three volumetrically major explosive eruptions separated by periods of basaltic lava flow activity and slower, thicker rhyolitic lava flows. One such group of lava flows, primarily located in the Madison Junction area, is known as the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series, which is dated between 1.28 million and 700,000 years ago. This is the time period between the formation of the Henrys Fork Caldera (1.3 million years ago) and Yellowstone Caldera (631,000 years ago).
  Left: This is a map of Yellowstone showing the extent of mapped Lava Creek Tuff members A and B, which erupted during the formation of Yellowstone Caldera about 631,000 years ago. Right: Geologic map of Madison Junction (1:125,000). Red star represents the location of a layer that was initially assigned to the Lava Creek Tuff but that is substantially older and represents a previously unknown eruptive unit. (Modified from Christiansen (2001) and Matthews et al. (2015).)
Until recently, the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series was believed to consist of non-explosive, effusive rhyolite lava flows; however, remapping in the area revealed a previously unrecognized volcanic unit. This unit — a dense, black, glassy rock — had been mapped as part of the Lava Creek Tuff (LCT), Yellowstone’s youngest super eruption, which occurred around 631,000 years ago. Yet argon dating on this glassy rock returned an age of 780,000 years, making it older than the LCT and placing it within the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series.
Although not surprising — geologists often find more eruptive diversity within known units — this specific rock suggests that the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series is not just composed of oozy lava flows.
So, what exactly is this mystery rock? It is a vitrophyre — a volcanic rock with a glassy matrix formed by rapid cooling. When lava or pyroclastic (ashy) material erupts, it can cool so quickly that the molten material solidifies into volcanic glass before a crystalline matrix has time to grow. In vitrophyres, phenocrysts — larger, well-formed crystals —  are suspended in the glassy groundmass. These crystals grew slowly in the magma chamber before eruption, but the glass preserves the story of a rapid temperature drop during and immediately after eruption.
This vitrophyre probably represents a smaller explosive eruption associated with the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series, different from the massive caldera-forming events, but still geologically significant. Such events might have produced ash plumes or pyroclastic flows that did not spread too far beyond the eruption source.
These combined ash and lava eruptions could have occurred more frequently in Yellowstone in the past but have gone unrecognized due to the limited resolution of older maps, burial by later eruptions, and the difficulty of preserving small amounts of ashy material in the landscape.
  This is a clean hand sample of the Mount Jackson vitrophyre. This sample has a black, glassy groundmass with large (1–3 mm, or a small fraction of an inch), white phenocrysts suspended in the glass. (Photo by Liv Wheeler/Montana State University)
As scientists continue to write the story of Yellowstone’s eruptive history, remapping and dating are crucial for finding more of these overlooked units. If one previously unrecognized volcanic unit can be uncovered, how many more remain hidden in Yellowstone’s geologic record?

(cunfek, iStock/Getty Images Plus)In 1971, the president of Mississippi State University, William L. Giles, invited President Richard Nixon to attend the dedication of U.S. Sen. John C. Stennis’ papers to the university library’s archives.
Nixon declined, but the Republican president sent a generous note in support of the veteran Democrat Stennis.
“Future students and scholars who study there will … familiarize themselves with the outstanding record of a U.S. Senator whose … judgment in complex areas of national security have been a source of strength and comfort to those who have led this Nation and to all who are concerned in preserving the freedom we cherish.”
Nixon’s prediction came true, perhaps ironically, considering the legal troubles over his own papers during the Watergate crisis. Congress passed the Presidential Records Act of 1978 after Nixon resigned.
Stennis’ gift to his alma mater caused a windfall of subsequent congressional donations to what is now the Mississippi Political Collections at Mississippi State University Libraries.
Now, 55 years later, Mississippi State University holds a body of records from a bipartisan group of officials that has positioned it to tell a major part of the state’s story in national and global politics. That story is told to over 100 patrons and dozens of college and K-12 classes each year.
The papers are fertile ground for scholarly research into Congress’ role in shaping U.S. history, with its extraordinary powers over lawmaking, the economy and one of the world’s largest militaries.
Mississippi State University, where I work as an assistant professor and director of the Mississippi Political Collections, is not alone in providing such a rich source of history. It is part of a national network of universities that hold and steward congressional papers.
But support for this stewardship is in jeopardy. With the White House’s proposed elimination of independent granting agencies such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, it is unclear what money will be available for this work in the future.

From research to public service

	Mississippi State University’s building of an expansive political archive is neither unique nor a break from practices by our national peers:
• The Richard Russell Library for Political Research and Studies at the University of Georgia — named after the U.S. senator from Georgia from 1933 to 1971 — has grown since its founding in 1974 into one of America’s premier research libraries of political history, with more than 600 manuscript collections and an extensive oral history collection.
• Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin donated his papers to Drake University to form The Harkin Institute, which memorializes Harkin’s role as chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act through disability policy research and education.
• Sens. Robert and Elizabeth Dole’s papers are the bedrock of the Dole Institute of Politics at Kansas University.
• In 2023, retiring Sens. Richard Shelby and Patrick Leahy donated their archives — Shelby to the University of Alabama and Leahy to the University of Vermont.
By lending their papers and relative political celebrity, members of Congress have laid the groundwork for repositories like these to promote policy research to enable local and state governments to shape legislation on issues central to their states.
 
More complete history

	When the repositories are at universities, they also provide educational programming that encourages public service for the next generations.
At Mississippi State University, the John C. Stennis Institute for Government and Community Development sponsors an organization that allows students to learn about government, voting, organizing and potential careers on Capitol Hill with trips to Washington, D.C.
Depositing congressional papers in states and districts, to be cared for by professional archivists and librarians, extends the life of the records and expands their utility.
When elected officials give their papers to their constituents, they ensure the public can see and use the papers. This is a way of returning their history to them, while giving them the power to assemble a more complete, independent version of their political history. While members of Congress are not required by law to donate their papers, they passed a bipartisan concurrent resolution in 2008 encouraging the practice.
Users of congressional archives range from historians to college students, local investigative journalists, political memoirists and documentary filmmakers. In advance of the 2020 election, we contributed historical materials to CNN’s reporting on Joe Biden’s controversial relationship with the Southern bloc of segregationist senators in his early Senate years.

Preserving the archives
While the results contribute to the humanities, the process of archival preservation and management is as complex a science as any other.
“Congressional records” is a broad term that encompasses many formats such as letters, diaries, notes, meeting minutes, speech transcripts, guestbooks and schedules.
They also include ephemera such as campaign bumper stickers, military medals and even ceremonial pieces of the original U.S. Capitol flooring. They contain rare photographs of everything from natural disaster damage to state dinners and legacy audiovisual materials such as 8 mm film, cassette tapes and vinyl records. Members of Congress also have donated their libraries of hundreds of books.
Archival preservation is a constantly evolving science. Only in the mid-20th century was the acid-free box developed to arrest the deterioration of paper records. After the advent of film-based photographs, archivists later learned to keep them away from light and heat, and they observed that audiovisual materials such as 8mm tape decompose from acid decay quickly if not stored in proper conditions.
Alongside preservation work comes the task of inventorying the records for public use. Archivists write finding aids — itemized, searchable catalogs of the records — and create metadata, which describes items in terms of size, creation date and location.
Future congressional papers will include born-digital content such as email and social media. This means traditional archiving will give way to digital preservation and data management. Federal law mandates that digital records have alt-text and transcription, and they need specialized expertise in file storage and data security because congressional papers often contain case files with sensitive personal data.
With congressional materials often clocking in at hundreds or thousands of linear feet, emerging artificial intelligence and automation technologies will usher this field into a new era, with AI speeding metadata and cataloging work to deliver usable records for researchers faster than ever.
 
No more funding?
All of this work takes money; most of it takes staff time. Institutions meet these needs through federal grants — the very grants at risk from the Trump administration’s proposed elimination of the agencies that administer them.
For example, West Virginia University has been awarded over $400,000 since 2021 from the National Endowment for the Humanities for the American Congress Digital Archives Portal project, a website that centralizes digitized congressional records at the university and a growing list of partners such as the University of Hawaii and the University of Oklahoma.
Past federal grants have funded other congressional papers projects, from basic supply needs such as folders to more complex repair of film and tape.
The Howard Baker Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee used National Endowment for the Humanities funds to purchase specialized supplies needed to store the papers of its namesake, the Republican senator who also served as chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan.
National Endowment for the Humanities funds helped process U.S. Rep. Pat Williams’ papers at the University of Montana, resulting in a searchable finding aid for the 87 boxes of records documenting the Montana Democrat’s 18 years in Congress.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “I have an unshaken conviction that democracy can never be undermined if we maintain our library resources and a national intelligence capable of utilizing them.”
With the current threat to federal grants — and agencies — that pay for the crucial work of stewarding these congressional papers, it appears that these records of democracy may no longer play their role in supporting that democracy.

Wes Moore (D), seen here at a 2023 hiring event in Baltimore vowed at the time to dramatically slash state job vacancies in an effort to ""rebuild state government."" On Thursday, Moore announced details of a buyout plan that is part of an effort to cut $121 million from the budget. The plan also includes a hiring freeze. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters).Thousands of state employees were notified by email Thursday of a buyout program, part of a plan by Gov. Wes Moore (D) to reduce the size of state government and cut $121 million from ongoing personnel expenses.
Details of the “voluntary separation program” were also posted on the website of the state Department of Budget and Management. The plan, first announced in late June, offers eligible, full-time employees in the executive branch $20,000, plus an additional $300 for each year of service. It will also cover six months of paid state health benefits and pay out unused leave and compensatory time.
There is no target for the number of employees the state is hoping will take the buyout, officials said.
“The VSP is one of several actions the governor has implemented to achieve the $121 million reduction, including the hiring freeze already announced,” a spokesperson for the Department of Budget and Management said in an email Friday.
There are nearly 52,000 positions within the state personnel and Maryland Department of Transportation personnel systems. About 4,800 were vacant as of May, the spokesperson said, and 13,500 are in job classifications that are exempt from the buyout offer.
Not all of the remaining workers will be eligible, because some have less than two years of service, and not every employee who applies will be approved.
“It is up to the agency and ultimately the secretary of Budget and Management to approve or deny an employee’s application,” the department spokesperson said.
The deadline to apply is 11:59 p.m. on Aug. 4.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) called the offer a “short-term fix for a long-term problem” created by Moore and the Democrat-controlled legislature.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“This program likely won’t do enough,” Hershey said in a statement. “The incentive is too small to prompt meaningful participation from higher-paid employees — the very group whose departure would deliver the most savings.”
Hershey said the $20,000 payout “is barely two months’ salary” in many cases. He warned of what he said would be additional efforts to raise taxes in the legislative session that beings in January.
“Unless Governor Moore is ready to truly reverse course — by scaling back the size and scope of government, embracing fiscal discipline, and respecting bipartisan ideas — Marylanders should brace for more service cuts, more workforce reductions, or yet another round of tax hikes,” Hershey’s statement said.
Nearly three dozen agencies are excluded from the offer. Another nearly 1,700 job classifications that are also ineligible.
Employees who submitted a resignation prior to July 10 are ineligible, even if they rescind their original decision.
Other ineligible workers include:

Those who have applied for service or disability retirement that are either under consideration or approved.
Terminated employees or those that receive notice of termination by Sept. 30.
Employees who transfer to another state job between July 10 and Sept. 30.
Employees who leave their state jobs before Sept. 30.

Officials in the Moore administration previously said the legislature, as part of the budget passed earlier this year, requires them to cut $121 million in ongoing expenses from the current year’s general fund budget.
The governor’s office laid out a plan in broad strokes late last month that includes eliminating 150 vacant positions and imposing a hiring freeze. The plan also called for buyouts. The administration has been reluctant to make public any exact targets.
Early conversations about the budget reductions included requiring as much as a 6% budget reduction from most departments and agencies, which could have been achieved through office space consolidation and other efficiencies, as well as personnel moves. Those same conversations included the possibility of voluntary buyouts and job reductions through attrition and even layoffs in some cases.
Legislators, however, differed with Moore on exactly what the budget reduction goal required — specifically the need to lay off employees.
Officials with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 3 — which represents more than 26,000 state employees — also staunchly opposed proposals that include laying off employees.

In a statement issued Friday, union officials reiterated their opposition to layoffs.
“Any solutions to help our state navigate these tough and volatile times must not come at the cost of providing quality state services,” the union staetment said.
Several agencies — the so-called 24/7 agencies that include state hospitals, the departments of Juvenile Services and the Public Safety and Correctional Services — already suffer from high numbers of vacancies that are covered with overtime.
Union leaders said they worry those understaffed agencies are already at risk for dangerous working conditions and workloads that are unsustainable.
“We want to reiterate that responsible decision-making around both cost-saving and revenue-raising measures must prioritize preserving our state services and the jobs of the workers who make them happen,” the union said. “That includes eliminating costly contracts, in-sourcing services where needed, addressing other inefficiencies, and closing corporate tax loopholes to raise much-needed state revenues.”
The effort to reduce the size of the workforce is a reversal of Moore’s promise to reduce the number of state vacancies. He entered the governor’s office in January 2023 vowing to “rebuild state government.”
At the time, he estimated there were 10,000 vacancies — a number that included the executive branch, higher education and other positions. He publicly committed to cutting that number in half in his first year in office.
He was unsuccessful.
At the same time, he also expanded the number of state jobs and raised salaries.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0131-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-12 04:03:09.651589

(Photo by Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters)A federal appeals court gave former Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby a partial win Friday, overturning her 2024 conviction for mortgage fraud but upholding perjury convictions in connection with the purchase of two Florida homes.
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also reversed a lower court’s order that Mosby forfeit a Florida condo as a result of the mortgage fraud conviction, noting that with the conviction now overturned, the forfeiture was improper.
Neither Mosby’s attorneys nor prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Maryland immediately responded to requests for comment on the case Friday.
Friday’s ruling is the latest turn in the legal trials of Mosby, who served two terms as Baltimore’s top prosecutor, from 2105-2023.
She was indicted in 2022 by a federal grand jury on two counts of perjury, for falsely claiming a COVID-19 hardship on an application to withdraw $90,000 from her retirement account, and two counts of mortgage fraud, on charges she made false statements on mortgage applications for the two vacation homes in Florida that she bought in 2021.
Her trials on the charges were held separately. At her perjury trial, Mosby argued that questions on the form that was the basis of her perjury conviction were “fundamentally ambiguous.” The form asked if she had suffrered “adverse financial consequences” during the COVID-19 pandemic that justified allowing her to withdraw retirement funds early without penalty; she said she feared the pandemic could affect Mahogany Elite, a travel firm she had founded.
Former prosecutor Mosby gets probation for perjury, false claims convictions

But prosecutors argued that Mahogany Elite could not have suffered financial consequences because it was brand new — she had “not yet started the company, earned any revenue, or incurred any costs.” Jurors apparently agreed, convicting her on Nov. 9, 2023, of both perjury counts.
At her mortgage fraud trial, Mosby argued that prosecutors never established that she was in Maryland when the alleged crimes occurred, but an overbroad jury instruction allowed them to determine she was, even in the absence of evidence. That jury convicted her on Feb. 7, 2024, of a single fraud count.
Federal prosecutors sought 20 months in jail for Mosby, in addition to supervised release and the forfeiture of her Longboat Key vacation condo. But U.S. District Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby sentenced Mosby to three years supervised release, with one of those years under home confinement, along with the forfeiture of the condo.
On appeal, the circuit court rejected her claims on the “ambiguous” form, saying it was without merit. It was “adequately clear” on the form what “adverse financial consequences” meant, Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker wrote in the ruling.
But the court agreed with Mosby on the jury instruction, saying the trial court’s instruction to jurors regarding the mortgage fraud case’s venue was indeed “erroneously overbroad.” Thacker’s opinion said those instructions “went so far as to say that the Government did not need to ‘prove that the crime itself was committed in this district,’”only that acts leading up to the crime were done in Maryland. That was wrong, Thacker wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After vacating the mortage fraud conviction, Thacker wrote, the court had to vacate the forfeiture of Mosby’s condo in Longboat Key, what had originally been ordered because the condo was believed to be “the fruit of the alleged mortgage fraud.”
In a partial dissent, Judge Paul Niemeyer said he would have upheld the mortgage fraud conviction along with the perjury convictions. He wrote that the evidence at her trial “amply and clearly demonstrated that venue was proper in Maryland by a preponderance of the evidence.”
“It showed that Mosby made the false statement in Maryland by obtaining and signing the false gift letter in Maryland and that she transmitted the statement from Maryland by uploading it to the Internet for use at the closing in Florida,” Niemeyer wrote. “She also engaged her husband to wire the funds from Maryland in support of the gift letter. ”

(Photo by Getty Images)For the past decade, Maryland emergency patients have suffered the longest emergency room wait times out of 50 states, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  Maryland ER patients are currently waiting over four hours on average for help, while some spend the night in the ER wait room or wait as long as 24 hours for care.
While blame for long wait times is sometimes attributed to overuse of the ER by patients, the actual number of ER visits per  1,000 population in Maryland is among the lowest in the U.S., according to Becker’s Hospital Review.
Meanwhile, under-staffed and overwhelmed ER medical staff try to care for emergency patients as best they can. Sadly, there is no end in sight to lengthy waits and no active attempt to fix this urgent problem in the near term. Without a safe level of staffing in the ER, Maryland patients will continue to endure long and potentially life-threatening waits for emergency care.
Maryland-based patient groups and health care workers have now formed an alliance called the Patient-Worker Collaborative to support legislation for a Safe Staffing Act. The collaborative is a coalition with over a million Marylanders including the health care workers’ union (1199 SEIU), Marylanders for Patient Rights, NAACP-Maryland State Conference, the American Federation of Teachers-Maryland, the Maryland Medical Society (Med Chi) and many more groups and individuals.

A Safe Staffing Act would bring the knowledge and experience of direct care workers to bear on reducing ER wait time and improving overall quality of care by formation of Safe Staffing Committees at each Maryland hospital. These committees would bring frontline, direct care workers together with hospital managers to ensure best practices in hospital staffing.
This is a commonsense approach, and nine other states have successfully passed legislation and implemented Safe Staffing Committees in their hospitals. Those states are Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Washington.
So, what impact have the Safe Staffing Committees had on ER wait time in the nine states that have passed a Safe Staffing Act, as compared to Maryland? Using CMS data, I compared the rate of change in ER wait time between 2019 and 2024 in Maryland and in the nine states with Safe Staffing Committees.
The results of my study are clear: Maryland ER wait time increased from 194 to 250 minutes, an increase of 28% — almost an hour.  By comparison, ER wait time in states with Safe Staffing Committees increased from average of 141 to 151 minutes, an average change of less than  7% — only 10 minutes. In fact, two states with Safe Staffing Committees, Washington and Nevada, actually decreased their ER wait times during this period. During that five year period, the average national for ER wait time for all 50 states increased from 135 to 163 minutes, a 20% increase.
In both 2024 and 2025, the Safe Staffing Act passed the Maryland House of Delegates with strong support from Health and Government Operations Committee Chair Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel).  In both years, however, the Safe Staffing Act failed in the Senate Finance Committee with the sole opposition of the Maryland Hospital Association, a lobbying group for hospital administrators.
Maryland hospitals need to be held accountable for their abject failure to provide timely emergency care to patients for 10 years. Hospital executives, who are already highly compensated, should not receive additional performance bonuses when they ignore the long wait times patients are suffering for emergency care.
Moreover, legislators who have enabled that failure should also be held accountable. Next year is an election year for state legislators, and Marylanders for Patient Rights will initiate a Vote Your Health Care campaign. We will encourage voters to support legislators who are protecting patients’ health care by ensuring that their local hospital is safely staffed.

,California,2025-07-12 05:23:34+00:00,CalMatters,Judge says immigration agents must stop ‘roving patrols’ that have upended Southern California,Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/la-immigration-restraining-order/,A court ruling Friday orders a halt to a chaotic and relentless 36-day immigration crackdown that’s upended life across Southern California.,"In summary
A court ruling Friday orders a halt to a chaotic and relentless 36-day immigration crackdown that’s upended life across Southern California. 



A federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday granted a temporary restraining order against the federal government’s aggressive, month-long immigration sweep across Southern California. 
A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights and local government agencies sought the order, arguing the raids have violated constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures by conducting warrantless stops on people who simply appear to be Latino, and due process rights to access to counsel in immigration detention, where they say detainees are facing “dungeon-like conditions.” 
In a 52-page order issued late Friday evening, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong wrote that the two questions before the court were if the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in proving that the government “is conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers?” and “what should be done about that?” 
The ruling could have far-reaching implications for the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. Over the last month, heavily armed immigration agents, often in masks and battle fatigues, have been aggressively detaining immigrants and U.S. citizens at Home Depots, car washes, and Latino markets across Los Angeles. Trump and other leaders have promised to bring similar raids to other major U.S. cities. 
Frimpong wrote, “the individuals and organizations who have brought this lawsuit have made a fairly modest request: that this court order the federal government to stop.” Frimpong wrote: “The court grants their request.”
The order bars federal agents from conducting detention stops in the district unless the agent has “reasonable suspicion” the person stopped is in “violation of U.S. immigration law.” The order prohibits agents from relying solely on four factors, either alone or in combination, that include “apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a particular location (e.g. bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, ect), the type of work one does.” 
“No matter the color of their skin, what language they speak, or where they work, everyone is guaranteed constitutional rights to protect them from unlawful stops,” Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California said in a statement. “While it does not take a federal judge to recognize that marauding bands of masked, rifle-toting goons have been violating ordinary people’s rights throughout Southern California, we are hopeful that today’s ruling will be a step toward accountability for the federal government’s flagrant lawlessness that we have all been witnessing.”


A second ruling orders the federal government to allow immigrants who have been detained to have access to counsel, and repeats concerns about the conditions in which they’ve been detained. 
“Individuals … are being kept in small, windowless rooms with dozens or more other detainees in cramped quarters. Detainees are also routinely deprived of food, and some have not even been given water other than what comes out of the combined sink and toilet in the group detention room,” the order states. 
“Is it unlawful to prevent people from having access to lawyers who can help them in immigration court? Yes it is,” the judge wrote, describing an incident in which federal officers deployed chemical agents against family members, attorneys and representatives seeking access to people being detained. 
In a basement holding area meant to only temporarily process immigrants, people have been held for extended periods of time and denied access to necessary medical care and medications. “The facility cannot provide detainees with basic hygiene; individuals who are menstruating have had to wait long periods before receiving menstrual pads, if they receive them at all,” Frimpong wrote. 
In a Thursday court hearing on the order, attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security argued that the plaintiffs should provide a $30 million bond to pay for training for agents to comply with the court’s order. Frimpong denied that request, writing that her restraining order “does not require any deviation from the training and the policies that appear to be in place, but rather compliance with the existing law.” 
The complaint, brought by the ACLU and a host of other rights groups, labeled the raids an unconstitutional “immigration dragnet,” driven by arrest quotas rather than probable cause or credible evidence. 
The Border Patrol carried out a similar, though smaller scale, operation in Kern County in January. Patrol agents arrested farmworkers and daylaborers after slashing tires, breaking windows, pulling people out of their cars, and throwing a grandmother to the ground. That too was halted by a federal judge along similar grounds. 


In response to that lawsuit, the Department of Homeland Security said it would be retraining some 900 Border Patrol agents on the constitution and following the Fourth Amendment. 
The Los Angeles area sweeps began more than a month ago with Homeland Security Investigations agents serving warrants at the Ambiance Apparel factory and storefront on June 6; dozens of people were detained. Since then, DHS says it has arrested 2,792 unauthorized immigrants in the Los Angeles area.  
Those raids turned deadly on Friday when a farmworker fell several stories off a greenhouse during Thursday’s large-scale operation at a marijuana farm in Camarillo, according to the United Farm Workers. 
“Farm workers rise before dawn to feed this country — there is no labor more dignified,” said Teresa Romero, president of United Farm Workers. “No one should be targeted, profiled, or terrorized for being brown and working hard. We are pleased the court recognized what’s at stake: the basic right to live and work without fear. We will keep fighting until that right is fully protected for all farm workers.”
The ACLU and Public Counsel filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrants arrested at Los Angeles area bus stops and two U.S. citizens who were also caught up in what the plaintiffs argue were “indiscriminate sweeps.” 
The federal government argues agents are conducting highly targeted operations, indicating they are arresting specific people. The leader of the LA operation, Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, made the same claim about the Kern County operation, which he led. But Border Patrol documents later showed it had no previous record of 77 of the 78 people it arrested.
DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin continued to make the same argument in response to the judge’s decision. 
“A district judge is undermining the will of the American people,” she said. “America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists—truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.”
The ruling does not stop the federal government from obtaining search warrants and continuing workplace raids. A hearing on whether the temporary restraining order should be extended into a preliminary injunction is expected in the coming weeks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070725_MacArthur-Park-Feds_JW_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-12 02:01:32.282035

Burgess Owens has yet to host a town hall meeting this term, California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs traveled to the state to take his place, the last stop of a national series of town halls Democrats organized this year.
Jacobs, a San Diego congresswoman, told reporters on Friday prior to the town hall that as one of the youngest members of Congress, she believes it’s important for residents of the youngest state to see representatives who understand what concerns young people.
“Constituent services (like mobile office hours) is only one piece of our job. Showing up and answering tough questions and having conversations with our constituents is another really important part of our job,” Jacobs said. “And our title is literally representative, and so it’s our job to represent people.”

And while she’s from California, a blue state frequently criticized by Utah elected officials, she sees a lot of common ground between her constituents and Utahns. 
“I’ve been here in Utah a day, but in that time, the things I’ve heard from folks here in Utah are that the cost of housing is too much, the cost of child care is too much, the cost of health care is too much,” she said. “Those are the exact same three things I hear from my constituents in San Diego.”
  Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-California speaks at “The People’s Townhall” at Salt Lake Community College on July 11, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)
In addition to Jacobs, the town hall panelists were Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King, state Rep. Grant Miller, D-Salt Lake City, Utah AFL-CIO President Jeff Worthington, Millcreek Mayor Jeff Silvestrini and Utah Democratic National Committee member Clare Collard.
Attendees asked questions about how to continue to advocate for Utah unions, whether the state will replace the frozen federal education funds, and solutions for the state’s housing shortage and the ailing Great Salt Lake. But, mostly, what Utahns can expect out of the “big, beautiful bill.”
“Every single one of your senators, despite what they might say about wanting to invest in pro-family policies, they just voted to kick kids off their Medicaid,” she said. “You know, 40% of all births in this country are covered by Medicaid. (With a) really high birth rate here in Utah, it’s pretty important that we have birth covered by health insurance.”
Jacobs also listed other local data to illustrate how the megabill is expected to impact Utahns — 188,000 people will lose health insurance in the state, 12,000 will be at risk of losing food assistance programs, more than 13,000 Utahns may lose their jobs, three rural hospitals may close, and electricity bills are projected to rise about 4%, she said.
Other federal hot-button topics brought up during the night included the increase in funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during natural disasters across the country.
Democratic Party message
While organizers said they hoped people with different political affiliations would engage in the town hall, most of the attendees appeared to align with the panelists, all democrats. The crowd listened with attention and only interrupted speakers to applaud. 
But, multiple questions hit on the same theme — what are Democrats in office doing to improve their message during the Trump administration?



Let us know what you think...


 


For Miller in the Utah House, “it’s not about taking a centrist stance. That’s not what people are looking for,” he said. “They’re looking for leadership.”
For Silvestrini, the party should go back to its working-class roots and focus less on “little things like pronouns,” he said. “We need to do a better job as Democrats of actually not being tuned out to some of the issues that are troubling folks that are not succeeding in our economic system,” Silvestrini said. 
But also, Democrats should be addressing issues like immigration, offering humane solutions that allow people to stay in the country with a path to citizenship, while at the same time, watching that the border is enforced.
“I think people are sick of the division in our country. And then if we can put out a message that unites people more, that doesn’t play on those divisions, we will do a better job. And then, our own worst enemies are their own worst enemies,” he added.
For Jacobs, the message has to come from everyone, she said. 
“Hot take, we don’t have a leader, and that’s OK,” she said. “And no perfectly poll-tested phrase is going to get us out of the mess that we’re in.”
People speaking to their friends and neighbors, breaking through misinformation is what could add to the coalition, she said.
“We need to be working together to build that broad-based coalition in order to push back and build that better democracy on the other side,” Jacobs said, “and reject the idea that only some of us can get what we need in this country, because it’s not true.”

Acre by acre, the village of Kipnuk is falling into the river.
The small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.
So when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.
But that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.
“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.
Kipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained by Floodlight through a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.
Floodlight’s analysis of the data shows:

Environmental justice grants took by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.


The EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials. Floodlight reported in April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.


Blue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.


The single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.

More cuts could be coming. The Washington Post reported in late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.

Lawsuit challenges grant cancellations
In June, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governments sued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.
“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”
The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:
“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”
Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.
But on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signed an executive order halting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a  Biden-era executive order that prioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called for the closures of all environmental justice offices and positions in the federal government.
 Rayna Paul, environmental director for the Native Village of Kipnuk, said the $20 million grant awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to the village was crucial for protecting buildings, homes and infrastructure threatened by riverbank erosion. But now the grant has been canceled, and the village may eventually have to relocate. (Photo courtesy of Rayna Paul) 
Underserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021 analysis by the EPA.
Inside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a “declaration of dissent,”more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.
“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.
On Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave, Inside Climate News reported.

But that grant was canceled. (Photo courtesy of Downwinders at Risk) 
From hope to heartbreak in Texas
The people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.
Last year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.
But on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.
“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.
He and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.
The nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.
“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”
This report was originally published by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) Forecasters are warning that much of eastern New Mexico, including Ruidoso, is under risk of flooding, with potential rainfalls as much as two to three inches per hour projected this weekend. 
“We could see that rainfall all along eastern New Mexico, including Clovis and Clayton,” said Nico Porcili, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “So if heavy rainfall rates happen over one of those populated areas, it could definitely cause some flooding.” 
The flood watch lasts from Friday evening into the weekend. 
Ruidoso remains at high risk with its already-saturated ground, debris, and the water-repellant soil from surrounding burn scars. The mountain village experienced deadly flash flooding earlier in the week, which displaced hundreds, required 65 swift water rescues and resulted in the deaths of three people.

“We’re expecting it to be ugly tomorrow,” Mayor Lynn Crawford told Source NM Friday, adding that equipment and personnel will start staging along the river on Saturday. “We’re going to be ready and then have personnel out there whenever the water starts receding, they’re in there and start trying to pull stuff out.” U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) toured the Emergency Operations Center and some of the damage on Friday, in addition to dropping supplies at the main donation hub: Humane Society of Lincoln County Resale Shop and Animal Shelter. 
“We are committed to the people in this community, we’re going to work with them, we’re going to rebuild,” Heinrich said in a social media post. “We’re going to make this watershed healthy again.” 
Cisco Diaz, the manager of the Resale Shop, said that all donations were welcome, but the greatest needs remain tools for removing debris: shovels, rakes, heavy-duty trashbags and disinfectants. More than 100 people sought supplies at the Humane Society’s restore on Friday, everything from necessities, to baby goods and cleaning supplies. 
Water systems repairs continue, local officials said, with some services restored, but repair on sewage infrastructure ongoing. 
The New Mexico Environment Department issued a boil-water advisory for any human or pet consumption for several hundred homes across four water systems. Those systems are: Cedar Creek Mutual Water Consumers Association, River Ranch RV Park, Ruidoso Downs Racetrack and Ruidoso Water System Upper Canyon neighborhoods. 
“Water line breaks caused by the flooding can reduce water pressure in the system, creating risk of contamination through growth of harmful bacteria and viruses,” said NMED spokesperson Muna Habib in a statement. “Until thorough assessments and lab testing confirm the water’s safety, boiling water is a highly recommended safeguard for public health.”
Contractors and homeowners alike were digging out all along the Rio Ruidoso, trying to clear the debris and prevent further damage. 
MP Chavez, a Lincoln County Commissioner and construction business owner, showed Source NM efforts to clear the Rio Ruidoso.  Pine structures, 22 feet long, and spanning the width of the river meant to catch debris were full of rocks and mud, the hillsides beneath the burned pines gouged with headcuts from the force of the rain driving down.

Kelley/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NOAA Fisheries)A federal appeals court on Friday affirmed the National Marine Fisheries Service’s 2024 decision rejecting attempts to strip Arctic ringed seals of Endangered Species Act protections.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s 2024 ruling concerning a 2022 lawsuit filed against the federal agency by the state of Alaska and the North Slope Borough. The state and borough had been seeking to compel NMFS to delist ringed seals, meaning remove the threatened listing status that had been enacted in 2012.
The appeals court agreed with the March 20, 2024, ruling by then-U.S. District Court Judge Joshua Kindred that found NMFS had acted properly when it rejected the state and borough petition for delisting.
The agency was reasonable in its use of climate change projections and its consideration of science about the seals’ response to sea ice loss, the appeals court said in its ruling. “In sum, NMFS reasonably determined that the petition did not present new information indicating that delisting the Arctic ringed seal may be warranted,” the ruling said.
The Center for Biological Diversity, which intervened in the case on behalf of NMFS, welcomed the decision.
“I’m so relieved these adorable seals will keep their Endangered Species Act protections,” Marlee Goska, Alaska staff attorney for the environmental organization, said in a statement. “The science is overwhelmingly clear that climate change is threatening the seals’ existence. The court rightly recognized there’s no scientific or legal reason for Alaska’s cruel attempt to strip away safeguards these seals need to survive our rapidly heating world.”
Ronald Opsahl, a senior assistant Alaska attorney general, said the state is reviewing the decision to determine possible future steps.
In a statement, Opsahl said the state continues to believe that the lower court ruling was wrong. “And, with its opinion, the Ninth Circuit seems to endorse the double standard between requests that an agency consider delisting a species and requests to list a species.  This double standard finds no basis in the Endangered Species Act,” he said. The court should have considered whether the state had provided sufficient information to suggest delisting may be warranted, he said. “Instead of finding that recent population studies and climate forecasts present new information, the panel deferred to the agencies’ disregard of this new information.”
Friday’s appeals court ruling is the latest event in a long history of litigation over Endangered Species Act protections for Arctic Alaska seals that are dependent on sea ice.
The 2012 threatened listings for ringed and bearded seals were prompted by lawsuits filed by the Center for Biological Diversity. The state, borough, oil industry groups and others have filed lawsuits challenging those listings.
Last year, a U.S. District Court ruling provided a legal victory to the state by striking down NMFS’ plan for establishing critical habitat for ringed and ice seals. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason concluded that the agency failed to provide sufficient justification for designating such a broad geographic area, totaling 174 million acres, as protected critical habitat for the seals. The agency and the Center for Biological Diversity appealed her decision late last year, and the case is now pending at the 9th Circuit.
Friday’s ruling was not the first by the appeals court that affirmed threatened listings for ice seals. The court made a similar ruling in 2018 in response to a different lawsuit filed by the state and others that challenged the ringed seal listing. Two years earlier, the appeals court upheld the threatened listing for bearded seals.

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders celebrated her family’s legacy with the Trump administration and Iowa ties Friday at the Family Leadership Summit.
The Summit, sponsored by the Family Leader, is an annual event promoting “pro-life” and anti-LGBTQ+ policy, religious liberty and “Christ-centered leadership.” The event is often a stop for GOP presidential hopefuls.
Sanders served as White House press secretary during President Donald Trump’s first term. Her father, Mike Huckabee is the current U.S. ambassador to Israel, a former Arkansas governor and a former candidate for president.
“When the president hired me, I was only the third woman and the very first mom to ever serve that role. I soon discovered that being a mom was actually the greatest preparation I could ever have for the White House press secretary,” Sanders said.
At the time Sanders was hired, she said, her kids were “five, three and one,” respectively. She claims her kids trained her in having the patience to “say no a lot” and “answer the same question over and over again.”
While at the summit, she told a story of the time her father took her to Yad Vasheem, Israel’s monument to the Holocaust. She also read aloud a text message to Trump sent by her father in Israel, in which he wrote, “You sent me to Israel to be your eyes, ears and voice and to make sure our flag flies above our embassy. My job is to be the last one to leave.”
Sanders said her father has spent “the better part of a month working from a bunker as Iranian missiles rain down on the country.”
Sanders also mentioned her work on AI policy, leading a group of 17 Republican governors in sending a letter advocating for the removal of the 10-year AI regulation moratorium from the “one, big beautiful bill” act. She also published an op-ed about the dangers of AI if left unchecked by Congress. The moratorium was removed from the budget bill on July 1.
“Doing what’s right led us to empower parents against big tech, keep explicit material out of the hands of our kids, protect our right to safeguard against some of the worst abuses of AI,” Sanders said.
She thanked Iowans for the 2008 presidential campaign she says helped propel her father to his current position.
“Iowa will always hold a very special place in my heart,” she said.
Sanders has made no official statement indicating interest in a presidential run in 2028.

Kim Reynolds celebrated her career as governor at The Family Leadership Summit Friday and applauded legislation that she said could close Iowa’s remaining Planned Parenthood clinics.
Reynolds spoke to hundreds of attendees at a daylong event sponsored by the Family Leader, an influential Christian-right group that lobbies for conservative policies at the Statehouse. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders headlined the event.
She recounted several pro-life policies enacted during  her governorship, including the passing of the “fetal heartbeat” law, House File 737. The 2023 law bans abortion when cardiac activity is detected, as early as six weeks of pregnancy. She told Summit attendees that there is “no effort she is prouder of,” and mentioned “as of today, abortions in Iowa are down more than 60% since the fall of Roe v. Wade.”

“It means that four of our state’s six Planned Parenthood centers are closing and if the courts allow President Trump’s one, big, beautiful bill to pull the remaining centers’ taxpayer funding, more may be on the way,” Reynolds said. 
The budget mega-bill bans Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood clinics for a year, which the organization says would not only limit access to abortion services in states where it is legal, but also deprive patients of access to standard reproductive care like birth control and cancer screenings. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit over the legislation, which is now under a temporary restraining order.
Reynolds also cheered the signing of her bill to provide paid parental leave to state employees, which passed through the Iowa Legislature with bipartisan support. This bill went into effect July 1. Under House File 889 Iowa state employees receive four weeks of paid leave for a parent who gives birth and one week for a non-birthing parent.
She also spoke on several bills related to transgender Iowans, including a 2022 law prohibiting trans athletes from competing in women’s sports and celebrated the removal of “gender identity” as a protected class from the Iowa Civil Rights Act, a decision that has received criticism from advocacy groups. 
She recounted her support for Israel in the form of policy that blocked funds from the Palestinian-led movement Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions through codifying the definition of antisemitism and helping provide body armor vests for the Israeli Defense Force.
Reynolds announced in April she would not seek reelection, citing a desire to spend more time with her family as a main reason for stepping down. She said Friday she plans to “find some way to continue to stay involved.”
“I love, absolutely love what I am doing, it’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve this state as your governor, so we didn’t approach it lightly,” Reynolds said. “But I’m missing my family and they’re growing up and my parents are getting older and I want to be there for them, like they’ve been there for me over the past 16 years.”
Reynolds has said she does not plan to endorse a candidate in the GOP primary, but expressed a desire for a successor who would stay the course.
“I hope the next governor of Iowa will build on this grace-built partnership because no matter who’s holding office at the Capitol, we have a duty to safeguard and steward the beautiful gift that we’ve been given,” Reynolds said. “A state where children are valued and the rights of parents are respected. Where taxes and the cost of living are low but character and value run high.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A draft ballot measure proposal under review by the Alaska Department of Law would decriminalize “magic mushrooms” and similar psychedelics, allowing home cultivation and personal use, as well as their use for medical and traditional reasons. 
The measure does not allow commercial sale.
“For most people, their lives will not change, but for people who really need support, they may be able to find it,” said Ismail Ali, interim co-executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a national nonprofit devoted to studying psychedelic substances and advocating their safe use. 
The “Alaska Natural Medicine Act” is modeled after Colorado’s Proposition 122, which was approved by voters in that state in 2022 and became effective this year. Oregon has also decriminalized the growth and use of psychedelic mushrooms.
If the Department of Law approves the measure for full-fledged signature-gathering, supporters would have to collect at least 34,099 signatures from registered voters, including specific minimums in at least 30 of 40 state House districts, in order to put the measure in front of voters.
If supporters gather the signatures before the Alaska Legislature convenes in January, the measure could be up for a vote in 2026. If the signature-gathering ends after the Legislature convenes, the measure would be subject to a vote in 2028.
The new measure is being supported by Natural Medicine Alaska, a group that submitted its initial draft with 230 signatures on June 18. In a post on social media, the group said it is attempting to get the issue on the ballot in 2026. 
Members of the group did not return multiple calls and emails seeking comment.
One hundred signatures were needed to start a legal review, a prerequisite before full signature gathering begins. The review, usually a formality, is expected to finish by Aug. 17. 
The text of the ballot measure states that it would no longer be a crime to possess, use, display, store or transport “fungi containing psilocybin or psilocyn, psilocybin or psilocyn in extract or other concentrated form, or plants or fungi capable of producing psilocybin, psilocyn, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), or mescaline (except from Peyote).”
The possession or use of those psychoactive chemicals would be restricted to people at least 21 years old.
Personal cultivation would be restricted to an area no more than 12 feet wide by 12 feet long.
The sale or trading of personally cultivated psychoactive fungi would be prohibited, and public consumption would still be banned. 
In many ways, the measure would legalize practices that already happen quietly in Alaska.
“There’s millions and millions of Americans who use psychedelics every year, and most of the time that goes off without a hitch, and people don’t even know about it,” Ali said.
He said Alaska’s proposed ballot measure is similar to the one enacted by Colorado but also takes into account subsequent rulemaking by that state. 
In addition to permitting personal use and setting up a regulatory system for medical use, the measure also creates a third channel of regulation, for traditional, Indigenous use of psychedelics.
“This is the first time that I’ve seen an advocacy group that includes a number of Native leadership and people who are not just geographically local, but also of the Indigenous tribes there,” Ali said. 
Alaska setting up a way to allow and regulate traditional use of psychedelic substances is something new, he said.
“I find that really beautiful and really ambitious, because it is something that comes up a lot, and it’s sort of like direct Indigenous to Indigenous conversation, which is happening increasingly in other states as well,” he said.
Psychedelic mushrooms remain a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law, except for clinical research, but Colorado, Oregon and more than a dozen cities have decriminalized them.
In those places, federal officials have not prosecuted people and businesses that use psychoactive substances, which has allowed individual states to experiment with different ways to regulate and use them, Ali said.
There is growing interest in psychoactives’ ability to treat people with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Clinical studies have found varied results, and additional research is underway at a variety of universities and laboratories nationwide. 
In 2024, the Alaska Legislature voted to create a task force to draft recommendations for psychedelic medicines if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
That task force released draft recommendations in May. 
Because the FDA rejected an initial psychedelic medicine application, those recommendations have never been implemented. In addition, the task force did not consider personal, recreational use as proposed by the ballot measure.
Currently, only one ballot measure — proposing new limits on financial contributions to candidates for public office — has been approved for the 2026 ballot. A second measure, seeking to repeal Alaska’s ranked choice voting system, is gathering signatures and is expected to garner enough support to also appear on the 2026 ballot.
If it does so, it will be the third time in six years that Alaskans have voted on the issue of ranked choice voting.

A home ripped from its foundation, cars turned over in driveways, dozens of uprooted trees and a bridge split by floodwaters.These were the scenes in the Northeast Kingdom on Friday morning, after a flash flood tore through parts of small towns like West Burke, Lyndon and Sutton on Thursday nightThis is the third year in a row that Vermont has experienced major flooding on July 10, causing Northeast Kingdom residents to question what the state can do to prevent what is becoming an annual tragedy. 
‘We’ve lost everything’
Michael Fix was having a great Thursday afternoon at his home in Sutton — the smoker was cooking, the canopy was up, the weather was nice, and his wife was preparing for a job interview. Shortly after returning from putting gas in their car, the downpour began and didn’t stop.
A car drove by his house, backed up 8 feet and hauled out of the neighborhood. When Fix stepped outside to investigate, he said he was met with heavy winds against his head and water rising from his ankles to his shins within seconds. He pushed himself against the garage as he struggled to make it back inside. The wind blew open his front door, and water began to enter the home.

An hour later, Fix would squeeze onto the roof with his wife and dog, rain beating down on them as a water rescue team fought to bring the couple to safety.“It was just running through the house. I got the door shut, my wife and my dog were in here, so she called 911,” he said.Their neighbors from across the way, fire chief Kyle Seymour and his wife, rushed down to the Fixes’ home, standing across the street from the quickly flooding scene. 
“Even though it was so hard to hear, they came down the hill and were like, ‘We know you’re here. Help is coming,’” Fix said.

It was only when state and Lyndon police arrived to help that the Fixes learned their home had come off its foundation. 
“They told us to get out of the house and get on the roof and just get as far away from the main structure as possible,” Fix said.
Following the rescue, the Fixes were brought to the Lyndon Fire Department, where they reunited with their son. They spent Thursday night in their son’s new apartment. 
“We moved in December 2001 and we loved it here, and in 2003 we got blessed with our son Evan and we raised him here,” Fix said through tears. “It was just a great place to raise my son, and we could walk to school, it was right up the hill.”

The Fixes said they don’t know what’s next for them. Their home is gone, and the two cars that once sat in their driveway — a new white Chevrolet Trailblazer and a green Subaru their son fixed up, sat tilted and wrecked in the driveway Friday.“Insurance has told us they’re not gonna cover anything of the house damage. We’re just hoping they’ll cover the cars,” Fix said. “We got some other friends that might be able to help us out after that. … They said there might be some housing help available, so right now it’s just trying to save what we can from the house.”
Fix, a self-employed painter and carpenter, turned to his garage.“All my ladders are gone. Can’t even get into the garage to see what’s up with the tools. I know it’s just filled up to my belly in mud, and I can’t even get the door open,” he said.
For now, Fix said he intends to clear out what remains of his son’s belongings and bring them back to the apartment.
“It’s just baby steps right now. Try to help get his stuff out and then, come back and then, do the next piece,” Fix said, looking back at his house. “We’ve lost everything.”

‘Holy smokes’
In Lyndon on Friday morning, Josh Robinson, a car parts salesman, walked past television reporters to stare down at a bridge cleaved in half.
“Holy smokes,” he muttered to himself.
A bridge on Lynburke Road that typically sits over the Passumpsic River had been split by floodwaters the night before. Around 8 feet of the bridge was gone, some of it laying in the new hole in the middle of the bridge, some of it washing away down the Passumpic.A swirling mass of pink, blue and yellow flowed on top of the river nearby — the result of fuel mixing with the water below.

“We’re not 100% sure where it’s coming from. State natural resources and myself have been monitoring it. There’s a car crushing company and an old junkyard just up the stream there,” Lyndon Health Officer Patrick McLaughlin said. “We have these large floods that flooded the complete junkyard, and so any oils that are left in the vehicles sometimes leach into the water. … All those cars were underwater when the river flooded.”
Robinson, who has lived in Vermont for 39 years, reflected on last year’s flood destruction.“There was a military vehicle, and it was tipped on the side and the water was right up almost to the motor,” he said. “It took me two and a half hours to make a 45-minute trip. They’re still working on flood damage from last year. … They’re getting worse and worse every year. Seems like more and more devastation.”
Robinson couldn’t think of a solution to the problem.

“Other than going through and making every single bridge three times bigger than they already are, what can you do about the water?” he said.
In Sutton, localized rainfall washed away road surfaces and beds around town, leaving only exposed rock underneath. Calendar Brook Road, which crosses over its namesake, was especially hard hit, Seymour, the Sutton fire chief, said. 
Around 10 households still lack road access to their homes, Seymour said. Right now, their first priority is getting those people single-lane road access. On Thursday night first-responders made a number of rescue efforts.
After seeing the destruction of the Fixes’ home, Seymour doesn’t think it can be repaired.
“How do we get them a new place to live? How do we get them money for that property that now has no value?” Seymour asked. “I don’t know the answers to those questions.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)The state of Idaho ended the 2025 fiscal year with a balanced budget and a positive cash balance of about $345 million, Gov. Brad Little announced in a press release issued Friday afternoon.
State revenues now $141 million below Idaho Legislature’s projections 

“Idaho leaders have long championed responsible budgeting and conservative principles that promote economic activity,” Little said in a written statement Friday. “What we’re doing is working. The Legislature and I have delivered historic tax relief while making critical investments in public schools, roads and infrastructure. In fact, state support for public education increased nearly 70% in a few short years, and we will continue to prioritize better teacher pay and classroom resources.”
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that ends July 1 and ends June 30. That means the 2025 fiscal year just ended.
Over the past couple of months, state revenues have come in below forecasts set by the Idaho Legislature in the state budget, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. But legislators and Little left enough of a cushion that the state still ended the year with a $345 million ending balance.
During the 2025 legislative session, state legislators and Little cut taxes by $400 million and spent another $50 million on a refundable tax credit for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
Those moves cut taxes and also reduced revenue available for the state budget by about $453 million.

(Photo by Juan Vassallo/Investigate Midwest)Arkansas will spend around $735,000 to improve drainage and water quality along unpaved roads in 12 counties, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ office announced Thursday.
“The vast majority of county roads in Arkansas are unpaved,” County Judges’ Association of Arkansas President Judge Rusty McMillon said in a press release. “This program provides much needed funding for improving sections of gravel roads that are sometimes left impassable due to significant erosion during rainfall and water runoff.”
Unpaved roads are a source of elevated sediment in ditches and streams as the roads erode and runoff from storms enters rivers and lakes. Too much sediment can harm wildlife and water quality, and can also increase costs for treating drinking water. The Arkansas Unpaved Roads Program, created in 2015, under the state Department of Agriculture was established to help address this.
The partnership with the state also helps make roads safer, McMillon said.
“Today’s announcement guarantees hardworking Arkansans in rural communities throughout the Natural State will have access to safe and reliable roads,” Sanders said in the release. She thanked the Arkansas Unpaved Roads Technical Committee and Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward for “spearheading this important effort to improve our state’s critical infrastructure.”
Many of the 12 projects will see the drainage and culverts along unpaved county roads improved or installed. The cost of the projects range from $37,352 to $75,000.
The funds come from the Arkansas Unpaved Roads Program, which is managed by the Arkansas Department of Agriculture. Projects funded by the program are reviewed and recommended by the Arkansas Unpaved Roads Technical Committee.

Acre-feet is a unit of volume expressing the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land in water one foot deep. For comparison, a football field without the end zones is a little bit bigger than one acre.
Water issues in Idaho are extremely important to farmers who depend on water to irrigate their crops. 
Under Idaho law, surface water users with senior – or older – water rights like the Twin Falls Canal Co. have priority over water users with junior water rights who are pumping water from the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer.

 Southern Idaho water users participating in 2024 settlement agreement should be spared from curtailment

However, Idaho water users who are participating and in compliance with the 2024 settlement agreement will avoid having their water curtailed, which means shut off, state officials said.

“Idaho law and the constitution remain clear about first in time, first in right,” Brian Patton, Idaho Department of Water Resources deputy director, said in a written statement. “However, regardless of these facts, most water users will not face curtailment thanks to the hard work farmers put in last summer to create the 2024 water settlement. Compromises like this, and investments in our water supply, will benefit Idaho water users into the future and I applaud their foresight.”
Water users have until July 25 to demonstrate to the Idaho Department of Water Resources that they are participating in an approved mitigation plan, such as the 2024 settlement agreement, to avoid having their water curtailed to cover the shortfall. 
Department officials encouraged any junior water users who are not part of an approved plan to join one to avoid curtailment.
Last year, farmers negotiated through the growing and harvest season to reach the 2024 water settlement agreement after the Idaho Department of Water Resources issued an order requiring the holders of 6,400 junior water rights holders to shut off their water to cover a forecasted shortfall.

While yesterday’s floods were much smaller in scale than in previous years, the date’s symbolic nature brought painful memories and underlined the new regularity of flooding in Vermont.

Whenever it rains hard, Sutton Fire Chief Kyle Seymour finds himself driving around town, keeping a watchful eye on local roads and rivers. 
“Thunder wakes me up now,” he said. 
The floods that pummeled Vermont on July 10, 2023, caught Seymour by surprise. They were called historic at the time — until history repeated itself on the same date a year later, surprising Seymour again.
But this year, he was on guard. 
“It’s no longer paranoia,” he said.

Late Thursday afternoon, heavy thunderstorms hit the state again but on a smaller scale than previous years. The impact from Thursday’s rain was largely concentrated to a handful of towns in the Northeast Kingdom and Addison County, hitting West Burke and Sutton the hardest, according to Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
“Yesterday’s events coming on the anniversary — that is a slap in the face, right? That is very hard to accept mentally,” said Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer, who was appointed by the governor after floods in July 2023.
People are grappling with the trauma of floods from past years, both in physical loss and in mental health effects, Farnham said. Some of the homes hit by yesterday’s floods in Sutton were also hit hard last year — and the year before, Seymour said. 
The July 10 floods two years ago devastated towns across Vermont, such as Ludlow in the south all the way up to the Northeast Kingdom. Last year’s floods hit many of those same places again before they could fully recover. 
“The scale and scope are certainly less compared to the last two years,” Haynes said.

In Sutton, localized rainfall washed away road surfaces and beds around town — leaving only exposed rock underneath. Calendar Brook Road, which crosses over its namesake, was especially hard hit, Seymour said. 
Throughout May and the first half of June, Vermont saw much higher precipitation than average, according to Lesley-Ann L. Dupigny-Giroux, the state’s climatologist. That moisture “primed the pump” by saturating the ground just before yesterday’s rain. Similar conditions contributed to flooding in 2023 and during Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, she said. 
Climate change also contributes to the increased moisture in the air, later leading to higher precipitation, Dupigny-Giroux said. The changing climate also contributes to “troughs or dips in the jet stream,” she said, which can lead storms to persist over Vermont.
When asked why the event might be occurring the same time every year, meteorologist Haynes said July tends to be an apt time for hot, moist air that moves slowly. Those conditions tend to create thunderstorms that hit hard, rather than moving along, he said.

Then, locally, Vermonters feel the effects.
“We’re unfortunately getting good at this,” Seymour said. Town officials in Sutton are ready to start filling out paperwork for FEMA applications — though they just wrapped up the ones from last year, he said. Similarly, Farnham said state officials are ready to work with towns in the next steps. 
“Our pencils are sharp,” he said.

This story, by Teresa McMinn, was first published by The Cumberland Times-News on July 10. 
CUMBERLAND, Md. — Three people accused of participating in the cult-like group Zizians were granted a joint trial in Maryland on Tuesday and could be held at the Allegany County Detention Center for months longer than initially expected — but state and defense attorneys disagree on the reason why.
Jack LaSota, Michelle Zajko and Daniel Blank on Tuesday entered Allegany County Circuit Court in shackles that were removed for a hearing as eight sheriff’s deputies stood guard.
The codefendants were first charged with misdemeanor trespassing and illegal gun possession related to their February arrests in Frostburg and were indicted last month with new allegations that include felony drug offenses.

The trio appeared Tuesday before Judge Michael Twigg, who granted their request for a joint trial.
The latest court discussion indicated the cases could be tried together as late as December. “This is a unique circumstance,” Twigg said of the combined trial.
Allegany County State’s Attorney James Elliott said if the trial “goes smoothly,” it would take at least seven days.
He said his goal is to limit the state’s number of witnesses to about 30 people from multiple jurisdictions, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
“We’ve done our best” to contact every witness, Elliott said.
He spoke of lab tests on contents of two trucks confiscated when the defendants were arrested, and said the state learned from the FBI of new evidence the first week of June that led to the most recent, and superseding, charges.
Zajko’s attorney, George V. McKinley, argued the state had enough evidence to bring a drug charge at the beginning and should have made all the charges at the same time, rather than months apart, which bought time for the FBI to investigate alleged related cases in other jurisdictions.
“The federal government … they are the cause of this delay,” he said.
LaSota’s attorney David Morgan Schram said he found in discovery a Feb. 20 redacted email that indicated the FBI said it had seized LSD tabs during the Frostburg arrests. Zajko also faces a federal charge in Vermont for allegedly providing a gun used in a fatal shootout that left a U.S. border patrol agent dead earlier this year.
She has not appeared in court in Vermont to face that charge.
LaSota has been described by police as the leader of the group, was federally indicted last month in Maryland and charged as an armed fugitive in the Frostburg arrest. LaSota, a transgender woman, is listed as male in charging documents and held in the men’s detention center. 
VTDigger is using LaSota’s name as it appears in court documents since VTDigger has not been able to confirm which name she currently uses. She is also known as Andrea Phelps, Ann Grimes, Anne Grimes, Canaris, Julia LaSota and Ziz. 
Twigg set aside 10 consecutive business days for the trial.
However, after Zajko’s request to directly address the court Tuesday, Elliott said if that trend continues, the 10 days would turn into 20.
“I believe what I have to say is very important,” Zajko said, and Twigg allowed her to speak.
She read from handwritten notes and said the delay in the Allegany County case was intended to prevent her from stopping a wrongful death penalty for Teresa Youngblut in connection with the killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland earlier this year.
“The obvious (suspect) is the other border patrol agent,” Zajko said, and added she and her codefendants are being held in Allegany County “to prevent (the) truth from coming out.”
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection report, issued in May, said that Youngblut shot a Border Patrol agent during the traffic stop that turned fatal for Maland but did not specify whether Youngblut’s shot had killed the agent. U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to answer VTDigger’s questions seeking more information about the report.
Blank’s attorney, Rebecca Lechliter, said her client should have been released based on a case that began with trespassing and has been expanded to include the recent felony charges.
“All he’s been doing is sitting in jail,” she said, and added she’s been contacted by two separate government agencies that want Blank to provide information.
After Tuesday’s hearing, McKinley said he is very restricted in what he can say about the case beyond his personal opinion.
Media attention has been “overwhelming,” McKinley said, adding that he has received hundreds of requests for comments from reporters.
McKinley talked of massive files involved in the case.
“Discovery is huge,” he said and added that police body camera footage alone exceeds 40 hours.
Of a 16-page federal search warrant that pertains to the case, 11 pages were redacted, McKinley said.
He said Zajko’s handwritten motion to dismiss the case, which alleges the trio weren’t on private property during the Frostburg arrest, is credible.
McKinley discounted claims the three defendants are part of a dark and weird group as depicted in police and news reports.
“I firmly believe they are not a cult,” he said.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)State lawmakers spent nearly two hours Friday questioning elected officials from an East Arkansas city about its financial troubles, particularly under its recently removed mayor who was arrested by state police last month.
Arkansas Legislative Audit, a nonpartisan entity that investigates government, flagged a range of concerns in its report on Helena-West Helena’s financial behavior in 2023. Issues included multiple expenditures beyond what the city appropriated in its budget. The city’s deficits at the end of 2023  totaled more than $604,000, including $173,122 in the general fund, $192,094 in the street fund and $238,833 in the landfill fund, according to the report.
The city also failed to pay retirement system payments in 2024, resulting in a loss of state funds, and as of March had not paid remittances to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service since August 2023, according to the report.

Helena-West Helena 2023 audit 
“The City’s inability to pay its debts timely led to late payment fees, bank overdraft charges, utility shut-off notices, repossessions, and some vendors requiring cash payments on delivery,” the audit report states.
Auditors also noted unauthorized withdrawals from the city’s bank account, failure to make payments for financed purchases and lack of supporting documentation for credit card transactions.
Helena-West Helena is currently over $2 million in debt, an increase from $173,000 before ex-mayor Christopher Franklin took office in January 2023, city treasurer Derrick Turner told the Legislative Joint Auditing Committee.
Franklin was removed from office Monday by a court order issued July 1. State police charged him with four counts of Failure to Pay or File a Tax Return, a Class D felony, after an investigation revealed Franklin had not filed taxes in four of the past five years.
City Councilman Don Etherly is serving as Helena-West Helena’s mayor pro tempore, and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will appoint someone to finish the remaining year and a half of Franklin’s term.
Etherly, Turner and City Clerk Sandi Ramsey are jointly responsible for running the city, they said Friday while answering questions from lawmakers about the audit and the city’s ongoing financial struggles.
“I think the city of Helena-West Helena has sufficient revenue to operate, but there’s some spending that, as I describe, [has] just been reckless,” Etherly said, attributing the spending to Franklin. “If it’s controlled, I think the city can operate functionally.”
In late May, Franklin refused to resign as mayor after the City Council voted 6-0 that he step down. The resolution was a response to a profanity-laden video call between the mayor, his adult daughter and his adult niece that went viral online.

The Helena World reported at the time that petitions were being circulated in Helena-West Helena seeking a recall election to remove the mayor.
Franklin was present at Friday’s committee meeting, but he said he could not answer lawmakers’ questions due to pending litigation.
The 2023 audit found “a lack of adequate controls” over Helena-West Helena’s accounting, which had been an issue in previous audits. Franklin said in his response to the report that the city clerk and treasurer should be held responsible for such issues instead of him. He said he would make sure the clerk and treasurer “rectify this weakness without delay.”
Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, asked Ramsey if she agreed that there was a “weakness” in her office, and she said she disagreed.
“I am a good city clerk [and] I try to find the money to pay the bills,” Ramsey said. “…The responsibility of running the city is not totally on the clerk or the treasurer. It’s always been a joint effort to make sure we do things right.”
 ‘Stop the bleeding’

Part of Ramsey’s job is to advise the city council on whether to approve expenditures and appropriations based on whether the city has the money, she told Rep. RJ Hawk, R-Bryant, the committee’s House vice chair.
“Even though we tell them we’re going to have trouble making a payment or we don’t need to make a payment or whatever, it’s their decision to vote on it, and then we just try to find the money to make the payment,” Ramsey said.

The city’s biggest expense is its payroll, which costs about $140,000 every two weeks, and cutting staff and services would be the most efficient way to get the city out of debt, Ramsey said.
Turner said the city has roughly 140 employees, with 20 working for the water department and about 50 working for the police and fire departments.
Rep. Jack Ladyman, R-Jonesboro, asked if current city leaders can make staff cuts and other financial decisions in the absence of a mayor.
“You all have to stop the bleeding here, and it needs to be done quickly,” Ladyman said.
Ramsey said attorneys with both the city and the Arkansas Municipal League have advised her, Turner and Etherly “not to make any major decisions,” but the city has stopped hiring in most departments and decreased most spending, including putting a moratorium on overtime pay.
Sen. Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, asked if Helena-West Helena tried to bring in more revenue by raising utility rates for water or garbage collection. Etherly said the city raised its water rates after failing infrastructure left the city without water in January 2024.
Additionally, the water department had to use its sanitation fees “to keep their doors open” this year, even though the money was supposed to go to the city’s general fund, Etherly said.
The city has not considered filing for bankruptcy, Turner said, as far as he is aware.
The Legislative Joint Auditing Committee voted with no dissent to file the audit report.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner) While Gov. Tony Evers has touted the new state budget’s child care funds as a compromise victory, some providers say they’re deeply disappointed. 
“This was not a win,” said Bloomer child care provider Caitlin Mitchell at a rally outside the Capitol Friday morning organized by Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN). “It was a temporary fix with long-term consequences.”
A press release from Evers’ office after he signed the budget early on July 3 said the document contains “Over $360 million to support Wisconsin’s child care industry and help lower child care costs for working families, a third of which is in direct payments to providers.”
A majority of Democratic lawmakers voted against the budget, citing shortcomings in funding for public schools as well as for child care. Assembly and Senate Democrats who voted in favor of the plan described it as a compromise. 
“I really really wish that the governor and the Democrats had just admitted that this was the best that they could do and that it’s still not good,” Corrine Hendrickson, a child care provider and WECAN co-founder, told reporters at the Friday morning rally.
“Everything we’re being told about the budget absolutely does not help children in our state at all,” said WECAN’s other co-founder, Brooke Legler. “The only compromise was the children’s safety. And this isn’t OK.”
WECAN members say that the budget’s child care funding is well short of what they need, and that regulatory changes are bad for providers, families and children. 
A pilot program increases Wisconsin Shares payments by up to $200 a month if providers agree to higher ratios of four children to one teacher for children 18 months or younger, and seven children to one teacher for children 18 months to 2½ years old. Wisconsin Shares subsidizes child care for low-income families.
According to Hendrickson, the ratio increase lowers the quality of care, and tying it to the subsidy program treats the poorer children differently than the rest of the children in care.
“Those children deserve to have more time and attention,” she said in her address to the rally. “Their parents are loving, their parents are caring, but their parents are stressed because they’re in poverty and that affects those kids.”
Child care providers should refuse to participate in that pilot, she said. 
Another provision lowers the minimum age for an assistant child care teacher to 16 from 18, while retaining the education requirements for the position.
“Sixteen-year-olds are wonderful human beings but they are not teachers of young children,” said Hendrickson.
“Those exact same policies were presented two years ago through the normal process of creating a bill. And we as a state overwhelmingly said no,” said Legler. “It did not even make it out of committee.”
In addition to $110 million in direct payments to providers, the child care total’s other big ticket items include $123 million to increase reimbursements that providers get for children in the Wisconsin Shares subsidy program and $65 million for providers who participate in a new “school readiness” program similar to 4-year-old kindergarten.
The $110 million direct payments, which would end after the budget’s first year, amount to about one-fourth of the $480 million that Evers originally sought. His budget proposal aimed to continue the state’s Child Care Counts program, funded by federal pandemic relief money.
At its height, Child Care Counts paid out $20 million a month and was credited with helping providers boost wages for child care teachers without raising tuition for parents. Two years ago the Evers administration dialed the program back to $10 million a month to stretch out its payments. The federal funds have now run out.










So, no, tuition prices will not be lowering; in fact, they will be going up next month to cover this loss, or providers will be closing their doors, especially in rural areas.


– Letter from child care providers group WECAN to Gov. Tony Evers, criticizing the state budget's child care funding.


In a survey of child care providers earlier this year the University of Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty reported that about one in four said they could close without continued payments. Evers cited the survey during the spring while campaigning for his original $480 million child care proposal.
WECAN leaders sent Evers a statement Friday, calling on him to order a special session of the Legislature and seek the full amount of child care support that he originally submitted for the 2025-27 state budget.
“We’re asking Gov. Evers to finish what’s been started,” Mitchell said in her rally speech. “Temporary funding and weakened standards are not enough. We need a comprehensive long-term investment in child care.”
After the 2023-25 budget was enacted without the child care investment that Evers sought, the governor called a special session and introduced a bill that included funding for child care, education and other priorities. The Legislature’s Republican majority rewrote the bill, replacing his provisions with tax cut measures that Evers vetoed. 
Hendrickson acknowledged the outcome of the special session call two years ago, but said in an interview that Evers should pursue  effort anyway. 
“This is the only thing that we can do to keep this in front of everybody, to keep it top of mind,” she said. 
“The $110 million over the next 11 months is around 20% less than we are currently receiving,” WECAN’s letter to the governor states. “So, no, tuition prices will not be lowering; in fact, they will be going up next month to cover this loss, or providers will be closing their doors, especially in rural areas.”
The WECAN statement tells Evers that his public assertion that the child care provisions will lower costs “creates confusion and parents will blame us; disrupting our important relationship due to the distrust your words have sown.”
Legler told the Wisconsin Examiner later Friday that when the WECAN group delivered the letter and spoke with Evers’ communications director, Britt Cudaback, the conversation didn’t go well from her perspective.
“We felt very minimized, unheard and condescended to,” Legler said.
Evers’ office has not responded to requests for comment.

“It’s probably better that we didn’t know,” Coleman said. “We enjoyed ourselves. I’m not too worried about getting sick.” 


Coleman learned of a potential health concern after the fact while hiking out from Lonesome Lake, which sits at the bottom of the cirque and forms the headwaters of the North Popo Agie River. 
Lonesome Lake has long been reputed to be unfit for drinking and even swimming. That’s due to contamination presumed to be from the hordes of humans who poop while traveling through the popular backcountry basin. Now there’s a datapoint to back it up. 
On Aug. 9, 2022, during the height of the recreation season, environmental regulators gathered a water sample from a foot below the surface near the outlet of Lonesome Lake.

The concentration of Enterococci — bacteria indicative of fecal matter — jumped off the page. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn’t make the results public for two years. When they were published, heads turned. 
Lonesome Lake’s sample contained 490,895 calibrator cell equivalents of Enterococci for every 100 milliliters. The EPA’s safety threshold for swimming is 1,280 CCE/100 mL. 
The concentration of fecal bacteria, in other words, was 384 times greater than the EPA’s criteria. Not only that, but the fecal bacteria were more concentrated in Lonesome Lake than in any of the other 981 lakes that were surveyed around the country for the federal agency’s National Lakes Assessment, which gathers data for randomly selected ponds, lakes and reservoirs every five years.

Arguably, Lonesome Lake was the most spectacular, remote waterbody in the broad study examining lake health all around the United States. Its snowmelt-fed 35 acres of crystal clear water, located within the Popo Agie Wilderness, are just a half mile off the Continental Divide along the spine of a mountain range that hosts more than two dozen glaciers and the highest peak in Wyoming. 
And yet the data also suggested that Lonesome Lake’s water was the most polluted by poop. That’s especially remarkable given that the assessment also looked at lakes and ponds in urban areas and agricultural regions more typically associated with feces-related pollution. 
Early in the process
The sky-high Enterococci concentration found during the EPA’s 2022 survey — sampling conducted by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality — set off a chain of events.
Because of its location in a designated wilderness area, Lonesome Lake is classified by Wyoming as a “Class 1” water. That’s a designation that protects uses like “primary contact recreation,” and demands that “nonpoint sources of pollution” be controlled through “best management practices.” 
The DEQ and the Shoshone National Forest decided they needed more data to understand the scope of what’s going on. 
“A single datapoint doesn’t necessarily tell us much of anything,” said Ron Steg, DEQ’s Lander Office Manager. “We need to get some real data to understand if there is a problem. If there is, we’ll react to the results of the data.”

In October 2024, weeks after the EPA results came out, staffers with the federal and state agencies trekked into the cirque to conduct follow-up testing. Gathering water samples outside of the busy backpacking and climbing season — trail-counter data shows that use virtually shuts off entirely come mid-September — they weren’t able to detect any levels of another fecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli).
That sample was collected “well past peak recreation season, from a source standpoint,” said Jeremy ZumBerge, who supervises DEQ’s Surface Water Monitoring Program. “You’re also past peak exposure time — when people are most likely to be exposed.” 
This summer, a much more extensive effort is underway to suss out what exactly is going on in Lonesome Lake. 

Water near popular recreation areas in Lonesome and Big Sandy lakes is being sampled five times during the busy summer backpacking season in 2025. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality probe could precede an impairment designation in one or both lakes, if regulators detect dangerous levels of E. coli bacteria. (Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.)
Between July 14 and Sept. 11, DEQ and U.S. Forest Service officials will take five samples near the south and west shore, where trails come down off of Jackass Pass and the North Fork and concentrate use. While they’re at it, the team of hydrologists and watershed protection specialists will also take water samples from Big Sandy Lake, located on the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
“That was of interest to the Forest Service, knowing that Big Sandy is also a very popular destination — and it is very convenient, as it’s off the main trail used to access Lonesome Lake,” ZumBerge said.

The specifics of the joint state-federal investigation are laid out in a “sampling and analysis plan” for Lonesome and Big Sandy lakes that Wyoming DEQ published in March. The results will be published in a subsequent DEQ assessment report.
The scientific inquiry has the potential to elucidate an environmental hazard that frequent Wind River Range travelers have long been aware of. It’s no secret: Lonesome Lake’s diminutive watershed — just 2 square miles — is thought to be overrun with poop that makes its water unsafe. The guidance is all over the place online, and is also frequently passed along word of mouth. 
Poop lake
“I tell people definitely do not swim in there, I tell people definitely do not drink the water,” said Brian Cromack, an employee of Pinedale’s Great Outdoor Shop who often advises Wind River Range travelers. “It’s been heavily contaminated for a long time, just via the negligence of outdoor recreation enthusiasts over the years.” 
Fecal bacteria readings 384 times the safety threshold “sounds about right,” Cromack said. 
“Hopefully, people are more mindful,” Cromack said. “I think the big problem why Lonesome Lake is so bad is because of the serious climbing prevalence there. Generally, backpackers are a little bit more conscientious about how to dispose of their waste. Not to rag on any one group — I love to climb.”

Regardless of who’s doing the pooping, there’s a lot of it and it’s easy to find. 
WyoFile visited Lonesome Lake on Wednesday and within minutes found seven makeshift latrines in likely areas — in the trees, not far off the trail. Most were loosely buried to varying degrees. In other places, toilet paper and excrement had become exposed. 
Lonesome Lake attracts more than 300 people a week throughout the busiest stretch of the backpacking season in August. The crowds, and the feces they deposit in shallow makeshift latrines, appear to be overwhelming the small, scenic lake deep in the Shoshone National Forest backcountry. (Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality)

And it’s not yet peak busy season. Early July, according to the trail-counter data, attracts 100 people or fewer to Lonesome Lake weekly. By early August, the weekly counts crest 250 wilderness travelers, and by the middle of August, a whopping 400 people are trekking into the Cirque of the Towers every seven days. 
Collectively, it’s a lot of biomass. A decent chunk of it gets left behind. Back-of-the-napkin poop math suggests that, at roughly a quarter pound per stool, perhaps 100 pounds of human feces are getting squished under rocks or buried in the shallow soil that rings Lonesome Lake on a weekly basis during the height of summer.

“I don’t know specifically how that [fecal bacteria] transport to the lake could occur,” said ZumBerge, the Surface Water Monitoring Program supervisor. “I imagine there’s a few different ways that transport can make it to the lake — if it’s happening.” 
At between 10,000 feet and nearly 13,000 feet in elevation, the Cirque of the Towers and the basin it surrounds are buried by feet of snow each winter. It melts off in the spring and summer, bound for the low point of Lonesome Lake.  
Possible fixes?
Hiking along Lonesome Lake’s southern shoreline early Wednesday afternoon, Glenwood Springs, Colorado, resident Carl Meinecke, an arborist, wasn’t so shocked by the fecal phenomenon.
“It’s not completely surprising,” Meinecke said. “Things aren’t like they used to be. We’re getting such high use in some of these areas, it becomes tricky.”

The regulations on many western rivers, he pointed out, require that campers carry out their waste in specialized containers known as wag bags or a groover. 
“That would be pretty tough here, carrying it out,” Meinecke said.
It wouldn’t be unheard of. 
As nearby as Grand Teton National Park, poop-removal regulations are in place. Portable toilet systems are required for backcountry camping on Jackson Lake and all overnight users of Garnet Canyon must pack out their human waste in EPA-approved containers, according to the park regulations.

Steg, at the DEQ, emphasized that it’s tough to know what the future holds. But if the data bears out, he said, the fecal bacteria concentrations will “certainly need to be addressed.”
“It’s a very unique situation to have a water quality issue this many miles into a wilderness area,” Steg said. “It’s not something that any of us have regularly dealt with. We’ll see where the data points us.” 
ZumBerge, his DEQ colleague, was unaware of any other Wyoming waters where human use has been implicated in a fecal bacteria problem. During the 2022 EPA assessment, there were 27 total lakes randomly sampled in the state, including six in the Wind River Range. 
“Lonesome was the only one that rose to our attention as being potentially elevated,” ZumBerge said. 
Environmental regulators do have tools at their disposal designed to address water quality problems. “Total maximum daily load” [TMDL] plans, for example, are years-long strategies commonly used to bring waterways into compliance with the Clean Water Act. In Wyoming, they’ve been used to attempt to address livestock feces-related E. coli bacteria pollution in places like Star Valley’s Salt River. 
Steg, who supervises that program, said it’s way too early to say if a TMDL will be necessary for Lonesome Lake. 
“That’s a pretty big tool for a pretty simple problem — if, in fact, there is a problem,” he said.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Two dozen Hoosiers — most living near a forthcoming West Terre Haute project — railed against proposed carbon dioxide sequestration regulations in a two-hour hearing in Indianapolis on Friday.
“We need you to fight for us like this is happening to you,” Vigo County resident Rosemarie Scott told the three Department of Natural Resources staffers running the meeting from behind their laptops.
“Fight like you live there,” she continued. “Fight like this is right in front of your house, because (for) many of the people in this room, that’s the reality for them.”
She was among 18 mostly red-shirted in-person attendees living near a pilot project led by Wabash Valley Resources. The group chartered a bus to attend the public hearing.
WVR intends to pipe and inject 1.67 million tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce “low-carbon-intensity” anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant in Vigo County.
‘Too many unknowns’: As company forges on with carbon sequestration project, residents mobilize

Indiana’s Natural Resources Commission could vote for final adoption of the permanent rules as soon as Tuesday, at the next meeting in Mitchell, DNR Assistant General Counsel Whitney Wampler said.
DNR has been developing them since 2023, when lawmakers granted it that authority — and let it implement temporary, emergency rules.
The regulations could take effect as soon as October, per a regulatory analysis.
Included are definitions, agreements between pore space owners and storage operators, transmission pipeline certificates of authority, permitting, insurance requirements, record-keeping and more.
Witnesses argued the proposal isn’t good enough.
It has “vast and egregious regulatory gaps” and “prioritize(s) companies,” Vigo County resident Whitney Boyce said.

She and others criticized the definitions as overly vague and fodder for loopholes; sought verification for voluntary easements; pushed for stronger insurance requirements; worried about water use and contamination; feared leaks and more.
“When there is a leak and there is a plume, how does the (carbon dioxide) stay in a complete, round circle?” one remote participant asked sarcastically, to hearty laughter from in-person attendees. “Wabash Valley Resources, that’s all they tell us. They tell us, ‘It will not spread!'”
Lawmakers first authorized the pilot in 2019 and revisited it in 2022. In between, in 2022, they established requirements for carbon sequestration projects and exempted the pilot from them.
Ben Inskeep, the program director for Citizens Action Coalition, added that DNR should better protect public safety, require better site suitability data and remove the “arbitrary deadlines” set for itself from the regulations.
Participants also lambasted DNR’s process.
They noted that both public hearings have been held far from active projects during working hours. They called for a third, evening meeting to the west.
“Most of us are retired and stuff, and we can get on a bus and come over here,” said Vermillion County resident Flo Evinger. “… An everyday person that is working today cannot be on hold to get on the computer and talk. It’s almost like you do not want any comments from the public.”
She was one of several who criticized DNR Director Alan Morrison, a former state lawmaker appointed to the role by Gov. Mike Braun, for his legislative support of sequestration and acceptance of campaign donations from Wabash Valley Resources.
“How are we supposed to feel that we are getting a fair shake?” she asked.

A policy change by the Trump administration could have large impacts on churches throughout Montana and the country. And in a state that has been at the fore of trying to eliminate political “dark money” — or funds that are hard to trace — this change could open a new frontier for candidates, donors and endorsements.
Known as “the Johnson Amendment,” a rule originally passed in 1954 and, sponsored by then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, a Texas Democrat, it prohibited 501(c)3 organizations from endorsing candidates or making political contributions. Most churches are 501(c)3s, a tax status or designation given by the Internal Revenue Service.
However, a decision this week by the Trump administration via the IRS said that it would no longer be enforcing the Johnson amendment, essentially allowing churches to engage in the political process, including using funds for political purposes.
Steven Emmert, the executive director of Secular Coalition, said that his organization strongly opposes the Trump administration’s decision, and he said it’s not alone. Polling data show 75% of Americans believe that churches should be prohibited from political contributions, and that includes 62% of self-identified evangelicals.
Though the rule has been in place for more than three-quarters of a century, the federal government has struggled to enforce it, leading some to say the Trump administration’s ruling simply aligns the policy with the reality. While the internet is replete with examples of church leaders making political statements supporting or criticizing political candidates, the IRS has rarely enforced the rule, which could cause a religious organization to lose its tax-exempt status.
The reason for the lack of enforcement is multifaceted. First, the IRS has traditionally said it focuses on other more flagrant tax abuses, like companies or individuals who don’t file or pay taxes. Moreover, it has said that the agency has been perennially understaffed so it struggles with enforcing other provisions. And finally, while public opinion polls have consistently showed Americans agreeing with the Johnson amendment, various administrations have resisted going after offending churches or other nonprofit organizations because of the optics: It looks like the government is harassing a church.
However, there is another reason why previous presidential administrations have been reluctant to enforce the amendment, said Constance Van Kley, an assistant professor at the University of Montana’s law school and a constitutional scholar.
“Churches raise legitimate constitutional issues and arguments,” she told the Daily Montanan.
For example, enforcement of the Johnson amendment necessarily involves matters of free speech and the “establishment clause,” which prohibits the government from sanctioning or establishing religion, often expressed as a separation between the church and state.
Still, the policy change could raise different, new questions about how money in politics works, as well as using a tax-exempt status to funnel tax-free funds to candidates.
  Follow the money 

Even though most people and churches have seen the Johnson amendment as a limitation on speech, Van Kley said that churches and their leaders have always been free to say whatever they wanted, even “from the pulpit.” However, that speech could have a literal price — the tax-exempt status of the church, which is no small detail.
Attorney and scholar Whitney Untiedt, writing on the Johnson amendment in a publication by Emory University’s law school, explained the rationale behind in the amendment and its use in the 2019 article, “Lighting the Way: The Johnson Amendment Stands Strong against Dark Money in Politics.”
In it, she points out that the IRS has 27 different nonprofit designations, but the amendment falls on what is likely the most commonly known, 501(c)3, so named because of the section of the code.
Those organizations have a special designation: Not only is income from 501(c)3 organizations tax-exempt — meaning they pay no taxes on most income; people who donate to those organizations also get a tax deduction. Untiedt explained that in exchange for that generous tax benefit, those organizations agree to the Johnson amendment, which prohibits engaging in political funding or endorsing candidates.
Yet even the complex IRS code didn’t outright ban those organizations from becoming active in the political process, it just required them to form a different nonprofit arm in which donations to the political portion of the organization would not be tax deductible, not so unlike corporations that form political action committees.
As the Trump administration decides not to enforce the Johnson amendment, it raises new, relatively uncharted scenarios for churches that were previously allowed to express opinions on social issues — think of the Roman Catholic Church and abortion — but not explicitly endorse candidates.
Supporters of the change point out that there are only two cases of the Johnson amendment being challenged, the most recent one being a church that took out a full newspaper ad urging readers not to vote for Bill Clinton as president of the United States.
Still, the Johnson amendment has kept most churches from overtly endorsing or getting involved in campaigns. Opponents of the change fear that relaxing the rule will open churches and religious organization up to money from organizations that pay churches to endorse or give contributions if they become politically active. Others fear scenarios where members may try to pressure or withhold contributions if a church doesn’t make the correct endorsements.
“It’s a little bit frightening with dark money because now big money dollars can influence elections via the pulpit,” Emmert said. “It’s very unpopular, even among evangelicals, because they don’t want endorsements from the clergy.”
Some of the pressure may come from big money groups, Emmert said, but he envisions another scenario: Let’s say a church needs a major repair, like a roof. A wealthy church member may condition a large donation to pay for a necessary repair on endorsing a certain political candidate.
He said that the Johnson amendment mirrors the sentiment of the American Founding Fathers because they witnessed what happened when the government of England required patronage of the Church of England.
“Your state can never be in your church, and most people recognize that and oppose it,” Emmert said, adding that this change invites politics into a religious setting. “The IRS has always done a poor job of enforcing it.”
Even years ago, Untiedt’s scholarship hinted that changing the Johnson amendment meant creating a new avenue for dark money.
“To claim that religious leaders are hamstrung by the Johnson Amendment is at best misinformed — and at worst, purposefully disingenuous. Though no proponent of repeal has publicly acknowledged as such, it certainly appears likely that at least one driving force behind the effort is to create a scheme in which unregulated ‘dark money’ contributions to candidates and PACs can be funded through 501(c)3 organizations that offer tax deductions to donors,” Untiedt said.
She said that would translate to $2.1 billion in lost revenue for the U.S. government because those donations, which would otherwise be taxed, would now become tax deductible.
Still, the threat of the law was enough to keep many churches from testing the waters.
Emmert said his coalition, which represents 31 different groups, worries that not enforcing the Johnson amendment creates a new problem: Can any nonprofit enter into the political dark money arena?
Van Kley raises a slightly different new concern with the policy change: Should the money going to religious organizations, which is tax exempt, be funneled to candidates or endorsements, using tax-deductible funds — an advantage that not all political groups have?
What has rankled some about the Trump administration’s decision to stop using the Johnson amendment has been its deliberate way of saying loudly that it wouldn’t be enforcing the law. However, Untiedt and others have pointed out that no administration since 1954 has really enforced the law.
Van Kley said what the Trump administration is doing is also understandable: Presidents and their administration always have to set priorities about what policies and laws to focus on as a matter of simple priorities.
“There has always been reasons to be concerned about the Johnson amendment,” Van Kley said. “That said, presidents make priorities, and many will not enforce laws that seem so open to Constitutional challenges — and this is one of them.”
And Van Kley points out that even though the religious organizations that have often pushed the boundaries of the Johnson amendment have been conservative leaning, the rule could mean an opportunity for left-leaning religious organizations to benefit, too.
One of the drawbacks of churches or religious organizations participating in the political process is that while the change may mean they’re more free to dabble in politics, they’ll face some of the same spending and reporting rules that other organizations and candidates face when it comes to campaign finance — an accounting headache that may be too cumbersome for some.
  A simple yet impossible solution 

Van Kley said that while many churches and organizations raise concerns about First Amendment issues with the Johnson amendment, the real sticking point is actually about taxation. Churches are — and always have been — free to make whatever statement they want, including endorsing candidates. However, doing so previously could have meant revoking their tax-exempt status and members losing the tax-deductible write-offs.
One way to end the controversy would be to end the tax exemption, but that would wind up costing religious organizations millions if not billions, something unlikely to garner any political support because of the proliferation of secular and religious nonprofits (as a disclaimer: The Daily Montanan and its parent organization are among those tax-exempt organizations).
Untiedt said the logic behind the Johnson amendment wasn’t about stopping churches from expressing opinions, rather a concern that allowing nonprofits the ability to exempt political donations would essentially be forcing taxpayers to pay for political campaigns by having to make up for lost tax revenue.
In 2018, 5,800 charitable and nonprofit organizations sent a letter to Congress urging them to uphold and maintain the Johnson amendment because they feared their organizations would be “exploited” for use as “another cog in the political machine or another loophole in campaign finance laws.”
Others fear that the policy change is another break from the democratic norms that have been upheld for years. However, Van Kley says other threats may be more troublesome from a legal standpoint.
In the case of political participation, Van Kley said that the change may just be squaring the policy with the reality. She said there are other better examples of norms being violated that should concern citizens. For example, she noted the recent TikTok ban that has been enacted by Congress. Van Kley notes the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress and many states, including Montana, has agreed that the popular social media application should be banned in the United States because of data security and the Chinese Communist government. Yet the Trump administration continues to delay and extend the ban though it really doesn’t have the authority to do that.
“The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled on the constitutionality of this, but yet it is still here,” she said.
Another example is the Trump administration shuttering agencies and programs that were created and funded through Congressional approval.
“Those undermine the goals of duly enacted legislation and Congressional approval,” Van Kley said. “(The Johnson amendment) example is a pattern of non-enforcement, so it’s less extreme.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Money-close-up-God-we-trust-1024x411.jpg,,,2025-07-11 18:12:01.783608

Free.,"Congress, state lawmakers move to juice aviation biofuel production",Allison Prang,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-state-lawmakers-move-juice-aviation-biofuel-production,,"Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn't as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Badger State billWisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.Other statesIowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.Federal extensionWhile the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.‘Not nearly as strong’Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.",,,,2025-07-11 18:12:01.783608

The Howard Center, a nonprofit in Chittenden County and Vermont’s largest health care provider dedicated to supporting people with substance use disorder, mental health issues and developmental needs, announced plans to cut 27 staff roles and will not fill 30 currently vacant roles. The center will also cut certain programming and services starting in September.The cuts follow “three years of multimillion-dollar operating deficits driven by rising health care costs and rising program costs,” where “at times, Howard Center has had only 
single-digit days of operating cash on hand,” according to a July 8 press release from the center. 
Ninety percent of the Howard Center’s budget goes toward the salaries and benefits of its staff.The Howard Center has a self-funded health care plan, but this has not spared it from rising health costs across Vermont, according to Howard Center CEO Sandra McGuire.“What we have experienced in the cost increase is the same thing that is driving the increase across the board, across the state, which is increased utilization, increased hospital costs and increased prescription costs. … Early on, we were shielded from those increases and it was positive for us. But in recent years, as our costs have more than doubled in the past five years, it is really the same trends and themes that I read about all across the state,” McGuire told VTDigger.
Since 2021, health care prices have increased for the center by 100%. In response to these increases, the Howard Center must reduce costs by almost $2.5 million in fiscal year 2026 — which started July 1 — and reach $3.6 million in savings annually to “stabilize operations,” according to the center’s press release.As a result, the center will slash 27 filled jobs and eliminate 30 vacant positions. To minimize cuts, “impacted employees will be offered existing positions” at the center, according to the release. 
“We currently have over 150 vacant positions for programs and services that will be continuing,” McGuire said. “Hopefully we can have a pretty comparable position for folks, but not always. … So staff make that choice themselves, right? Whether or not they wanna stay with us in a different position or not.”When asked why there were over 150 vacant positions, McGuire pointed to the demographics of an aging state.“Certainly over the years of the pandemic, like many others we lost staffing and that staffing has never recovered to the same level. … So we have worked hard to adjust programming and positions to be able to adapt to a new status quo,” she said. “… But in the more immediate term, ourselves, like many businesses, have not been able to staff at the levels that we were able to  eight to 10 years ago.”
The organization also plans to shut down day programming of Westview House, a home for adults with mental illnesses to socialize with one another during the day. The center also plans to consolidate substance use disorder services in Grand Isle, Franklin and Chittenden counties, however, mobile services in those areas are expected to continue.“We are actively working on conversations with other community providers with all of these changes to see what gaps could be filled in different ways. We’ve been having those conversations with providers for a while, and we will continue to, particularly as most organizations’ resources are getting a bit slimmer in the near term, hopefully not in the long term,” McGuire said. 
Between fiscal year 2022 and 2023, the center’s cash fell from $18.7 million to $8.2 million, followed by an over $2 million drop that left the center with just $6 million in fiscal year 2024.
State grants and contracts between 2023 and 2024 also decreased from $10.1 million to $8.3 million during this time. Federal grants took an even larger hit, dropping from $4.7 million to $1.3 million.As of June 30, 2024, the Howard Center had over $7 million in investments and a $6 million line of credit with TD Bank. McGuire said she doesn’t want to touch those to fix current financial woes, as they would be short-term solutions to an institution with a daily operational cost of $400,000.McGuire said the current cuts are unrelated to Medicaid cuts at the federal level, but that the center is monitoring those as they come.“Our budget is about 90% Medicaid overall. [The cuts] are really in response to our ongoing funding, and what we have for the dollars for this year and what our projected expenses are. We don’t know the impact yet. We are working to understand that as is everyone else what the impact of the federal dollars will be,” McGuire said.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)SIOUX FALLS — The scene was surreal from the jump.
There we were, a gang of eight reporters scrunched together in the claustrophobic lobby of the state penitentiary, waiting for a sales pitch on a product sold the day before to customers who were never us anyway.
The state’s Project Prison Reset task force had already voted to build a new prison on the eastern edge of the city that’s played host to “The Hill” since before statehood.
That group’s membership had toured the labyrinthine quartzite monolith that houses around 800 prisoners months ago.
We already knew the forthcoming message: This hill is no shining city. It’s a terrible, awful, no good, very bad place, unsafe for inmates and correctional officers alike.
Old hat, new cattle
Aside from an exclusive tour offered to KELO-TV earlier this year, the Department of Corrections has kept reporters out of the pen for the three-year duration of the new prison debate.
That’s partly why I showed up Wednesday with a unique perspective among our gang of eight. I was the only one who’d toured the building before. I’d been there plenty as an Argus Leader reporter. It used to be normal to visit the warden in their office, inmates in the visit room, or staff in their work environment, be that out on the floor or inside the prison industries building. I also witnessed an execution back in 2012.

I had at least some idea of what we were in for. 
On Wednesday morning, though, spokesman Michael Winder assured me I’d see more than I ever had before, and much of what had changed in the decade since I’d last darkened the pen’s reinforced doors.
This tour, he explained, would be the first to take us onto the catwalks where inmates live. We’d also see the communal shower downstairs, where 60 men bathe at once as another 60 wait outside on benches, and walk through the underground tunnel that leads to the indoor recreation area. 
That expanded access was among the reasons we weren’t allowed to bring cameras. Inmates have the right not to be photographed, Winder said — they don’t like to feel like animals in a zoo — and it would be impractical for him to police eight shutterbugs simultaneously.  
He’d take pictures for us, we were assured. The reason for saying no to audio recording or the use of our own notebooks never was fully explained.
Briefing: There will be catcalling
Some changes were apparent right away. We’d all need to pass through a metal detector, shoehorned into place in 2022 to create the pre-tour waiting zone’s aforementioned cramped conditions.

First, we were taken upstairs for a security briefing and introductions with the eight people who’d accompany us. We’d need to stick together and keep moving, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko told us. The men would stand at the front and back of our single-file line, Wasko explained, because inmates are less likely to catcall if a man stands between them and their target.
There would be catcalling, she promised.
We could see in through the barred second door of our first doubled-doored security checkpoint as we huddled and exchanged our driver’s licenses to Maj. Cody Hanson for visitor’s badges. 
That’s when I noticed the next new thing: A COVID-era poster asking inmates to queue 3 feet apart in the pickup line for commissary, otherwise known as the prison store. 
Some things hadn’t changed. The first five inmate faces I saw belonged to black and Native American men, a reminder that South Dakota, like the U.S. as a whole, locks up people of color at higher rates than white folks. 
First impressions: Pooled water and cusses
Between inmate drug overdoses, gang fights and security lockdowns, things have been pretty messy in state prisons lately. Wasko has come under no small amount of scrutiny as a result. It was no surprise to hear Winder tell us that two inmates had scuffled in the chow hall shortly before our tour (neither was seriously injured, he’d tell me the next day).
Once inside, we saw a less metaphorical mess. A pool of water spread across the floor from a cell in federal hall, the 170-bed midsection between East Hall and West Hall, the prison’s two linear, five-floor wings.
“We had a backup,” said a smiling Amber Pirraglia, the director of prisons.
Our group had to step around the toilet water puddle on its way to East Hall, a dance soundtracked by profane chants leveled by inmates at Wasko.

“This is just normal,” when she shows up, Wasko said, but “they’re pretty fired up.”
We hurried to one side of the hall, walking by rows of barred cells. Each floor of the five in East Hall has 20 cells on either side, each a home for two inmates in a space designed to hold one back in 1881.
Wasko doesn’t like bars, she said. Inmates can spit through bars. They can throw urine. She prefers solid doors with windows and closable food ports.
She also doesn’t like the size of the cells. Modern standards expect each inmate to have 35 square feet of “unencumbered space,” she told us. Inmates on the Hill split 56 total. That’s four less than my master bathroom at home, minus our closet space. I can barely squeeze by the bathtub to get to that closet when my 7-year-old’s brushing her teeth.
In the cells that weren’t blocked by hung T-shirts, I saw flip-flops tied to walls, paper trash bags stuffed between bars at the top of cells, and books and bags of chips and toiletries stuffed into every corner. 
‘They’re too fired up’
It was hot. The air conditioning is wildly inefficient. It felt like 80 degrees. 
“What air conditioning?” the Department of Correction’s inspector general said.
If you’re wondering what 400 people stuffed in a hot box with 200 toilets smell like at 80 feels-like degrees, you’ve wondered enough to know why the smoke we saw as we climbed the steps to the catwalk was an alarming sign but a welcome aroma.

“Something is on fire,” I wrote in my penitentiary-issue pocket notebook. “Can see the smoke.”
Inmates can start blazes by shoving toilet paper into electrical outlets, we were told.
Wasko wanted us on the narrow metal staircases so we could know what it’s like for the officers as they deliver food, mail and medicine, respond to fights on the catwalks or haul empty stretchers up and injured inmates down.
On the way up, we walked past two “fishing lines,” one of which had something tied to the end. They appeared to be fashioned out of T-shirts or bits of bed sheet. That’s how inmates deliver small bits of contraband from one tier to the next, Wasko told us.
At the top of the stairs, Wasko decided we weren’t going to walk across the fifth floor tier after all.
“They’re too fired up.”
Showers: Stabbings and steamed cameras
Next, we visited the showers below East Hall — and revisited that toilet backup.
One officer has to supervise the showers downstairs while another monitors a video feed. Every few feet in the entryway to the giant communal shower stall, we saw large tile columns — “prime locations” for injuries, Wasko said, as inmates can stay out of an officer’s sight line and strike or stab their targets.

Steam clouds the cameras on the opposite wall pretty quickly during shower time, Maj. Hanson said.
Modern prisons have showers in every “pod,” the circular cell configuration used in newer facilities, Wasko said. It’s typically one for every 12 inmates, she said, meaning fewer people for officers to watch and fewer opportunities for assaults or contraband passage. 
“They can shower whenever they want to,” she said of inmates in modern facilities, with curtains covering men at the midsection, and women at the chest and midsection. 
As Wasko spoke, water from the still-pooling toilet backup in the federal hall cell splashed from above to the floor below the stairway. 
Pirraglia mopped it up. 
Another waterfall fell in a sheet about a minute later. Pirraglia laughed. She left the mop against the wall.
50-cent video visits
From the showers, we walked through the white-walled underground tunnel that leads to the indoor recreation area. 
A tour guide pointed to the hallway’s wall phones. That’s where inmates call out from when they can’t call from their prison-issue electronic tablets. 
We also saw a video visit kiosk in that same hallway, the first in a set of what will be 17. The others, located in a separate room, are set to go live on Monday. 
The operational kiosk’s screen already had a spiderweb crack.
The kiosks are part of a video-only visit setup launched recently in response to the alleged passage of contraband during in-person visits. Some family members of inmates have complained on social media and to people like me about this. 
The price paid by inmates for the video calls that replace the free in-person visits is 50 cents a minute.
Pheasantland: Like Amazon, sort of
From there, it was Pheasantland Industries. One building houses the license plate, print and carpentry shops, as well as the space rented by Hope Haven Ministries, a nonprofit that distributes wheelchairs to the needy with the aid of inmate labor. 
On the days they work, anyway. No one was working when we showed up.
The shops looked much the same as before, with one major difference: There are now locked toolboxes with designated spots for every tool, installed as a preventative measure against the theft of potentially lethal weapons. 
Wasko seemed especially proud to show off the big metal warehouse now home to the commissary program and its inventory.

Inmates fluttered about between rows of shelving stacked with boxes of nacho chips, sodas, cookies and various other off-brand versions of consumer goods. Inmates order from their tablet, workers print out the orders from a computer, fill plastic bags with goods and sort them into wheeled carts for delivery. Orders meant for prisons in Springfield, Rapid City, Yankton or Pierre get boxed up to be shipped out.
“It’s like Amazon, right?” Maj. Hanson said. 
Kind of. I’ve toured that Sioux Falls distribution center. There were a lot more robots than zero. Also, I didn’t see seven pallets of ramen noodles — far and away the most popular item in the commissary catalog — but I’m sure the folks at Amazon have a few pallets stashed somewhere. 
Tour takeaways
Media tours of state facilities should be normal, not news. 
That it’s been so hard to get inside the pen as the state debates the most expensive taxpayer-funded project in state history — which is what a new prison will be if it ever gets built — is and has been disturbing.
It’s a fact made more disturbing as we continue to hear about fights, unrest, drug deals, gang fights, assaults on officers and overdose deaths.
That’s what I was thinking during the sales job. 
I wasn’t blown away by what a dump the place is. It was a lot louder and messier than I remember, but the cells are still tiny and it’s still hot as blazes. 
There are countless ways a new building, properly managed and maintained, would be safer and saner for all involved. Even those who call the place functional and reckon we can’t afford a new one wouldn’t argue otherwise.
That was also true 40 years ago. We’ve made do for a long time.
What’s true today is that the debate of this moment, while the state is flush with squirreled-away prison construction cash thanks in part to federal COVID relief awards, had been a closed off, take-it-or-leave-it affair until this year.
Before Gov. Larry Rhoden appointed the task force and set it to work in a series of public meetings, there were no public forums. The Lincoln County farm ground set to host the initially planned $825 million prison? That site was selected, not debated. Lawmakers got to visit the prison if they complained loudly enough, but reporters were forbidden.

The person to blame for all that might be on Fox News right now, talking about Texas floods or immigration raids.
“The old administration went to another job,” Wasko said when I asked her about the sudden shift in transparency, a reference to former governor and now Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. “We have a new administration that has different philosophies and different outlooks on our ability to talk about things.”
Under Rhoden thus far, she said, “I have been allowed to be responsive.”
Noem didn’t so much discourage transparency, Wasko said. It was more that when a question came in, there would be “a conversation that was had,” during which the department might be told “you know what, right now is probably not the best time” to answer. 
Which sounds a lot like discouragement to me. 
Let’s hope we’ve left that behind us.

Following another monumental collapse of parts of a world-famous skyline pinnacle, a climbing guide and his clients got a close-up view.
The post First visit to Grand Teton’s Second Tower after new collapse appeared first on WyoFile .","A longtime client of Exum climbing guide Jed Porter had the Grand Teton’s East Ridge route on his tick list for years. But the 2022 partial collapse of a pinnacle along the arete stymied his plans.
In spectacular fashion three years ago, a major portion of the Second Tower collapsed, pounding the Grand’s East Ridge and terrain below with tons of boulders, rocks and gravel. But by 2025, things appeared to have stabilized, and Porter and his client geared up for a go.
As they packed and planned, neither guide nor client realized that the Second Tower continued to fall apart. Days before they started at the base of the East Ridge on Tuesday, yet another part of the recognizable skyline pinnacle had disintegrated and rained tons more debris onto the climbing route, glaciers and snowfields below.
“It was obviously fresh debris … ugly shifting sand and angular rocks.” Jed Porter
“I hadn’t heard of anyone climbing the East Ridge since 2022,” Porter said Thursday. On a climb of the Grand via the Exum Ridge on Sunday, he looked down on the Second Tower almost a thousand feet below to check it out.
“I was looking at it closely,” Porter said. “I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.”
He checked with other guides who said they believed that the Second Tower had not changed since 2022.
Armed with that information and some extra gear in case a retreat might be in order, Porter, his longtime client and another client set off. They hiked to the base of the East Ridge, bivouacked Monday night and began climbing the East Ridge early the next day.
They would be, as far as they knew, the first people to see close-up what had occurred three years before. What they didn’t know was that they would be climbing across dust and detritus perhaps only three days old.
Ugly, shifting sand
Roped climbing on the East Ridge begins at about 10,600 feet, some 3,000 feet below the 13,775-foot summit. Porter’s team scrambled and climbed over and past various obstacles, including the Molar Tooth, the first tower on the long ridge.

As they approached the Second Tower, they couldn’t yet see the uphill side where a major part of the tower had fallen away. 
Only when they arrived at the notch between the Second Tower and the rest of the mountain would they see the geologic carnage and the Second Tower’s fresh, fractured face.
That last pitch up a chimney takes climbers beneath a stack of 15-foot high granite razor-blade chockstones, all held in place by seemingly imaginary forces. Despite the collapse just above it, the Damoclesian nightmare of chockstones remained intact. Porter climbed the chimney and brought his clients up where they saw the first traces of mayhem.

The slope was littered with “ugly shifting sand and angular rocks,” he said. “It was obviously fresh debris.”
“I didn’t realize how fresh it was,” Porter said. “I concluded it was from 2022.”
From the belay atop the chimney, the team passed across about 60 meters of fractured choss before reaching clean ground. All told, the group spent about 12 minutes in the danger zone, Porter said, still oblivious to the recent collapse.
Rangers’ Instagram
The team crossed the summit and bivouacked on the Lower Saddle on the way back to the valley. Once home, Porter’s client saw Monday’s Instagram post by Jenny Lake Rangers, Grand Teton National Park’s climbing and rescue squad.
Rangers published the post the day Porter’s group made its approach to the base of the East Ridge.
“Heads up!” the post reads. “Multiple major spontaneous rockfall events have occurred over the weekend.
“Most notably, another large part of the Second Tower on the Grand Teton has collapsed,” the post stated. “At this time, it is not known if the East Ridge climbing route has been impacted.”

Porter guesses the major collapse happened July 4 or July 5 during a storm, most likely the 4th because the weather was worse that day.
Porter reckoned he and his client had given the mountain enough time to stabilize after the 2022 collapse.
“It made a lot of sense to stay away 2023,” he said. “But by now, it seemed long enough had passed.”
He offered an overview. Big events like the collapses of the Second Tower don’t happen in isolation, he said.
“There’s some level of warning, some level of follow-up over weeks and months and years,” he said.
For example, small rockfall presaged a major rockslide from the Stettner Couloir on the Grand’s south side years ago, he said, and more, smaller events followed.
A prolonged kaboom!
Across the Tetons and in other ranges, alpinists are watching mountains crumbling at a faster rate than usual. Exum co-owner Nat Patridge described an event that happened Sunday when he was climbing the Exum Ridge.
“It was a loud prolonged kaboom!” he said. A rock cuboid about 9 feet long and 6 feet on its other sides had peeled off the mountain just above a chokepoint leading to the 11,600-foot Lower Saddle.
Had anyone been at the chokepoint, a rock step where fixed ropes aid climbers over a wee bulge, “it would have had you shaking in your boots,” Patridge said.
He’s seen other events, including a rock and mud slurry that flowed past the same spot in 2022, carrying boulders 3 feet in diameter.
“I had to jump out of the way,” Patridge said of the event, which came in waves and lasted about 20 minutes.
“It’s definitely related to heat, melting,” he said. “Snow used to hold things in place. Without the snow, we’re seeing much more rockfall.”
A guide with Jackson Hole Mountain Guides on Saturday photographed what appeared to be the debris from the second collapse of the Second Tower. Porter Crockard said he and fellow guides heard rockfall from their nearby camp the night before.
“We are seeing rockfall with climate change,” he said. “The mountains are a dynamic place.
“It’s up to all of us to be thoughtful how we move around,” he said, “and communicate areas of hazard among the community. Safety is always our top priority.”

Instead of helping people successfully integrate back into society, they said, the system creates a tripwire of rules that can easily be broken and result in too many people being ordered back to prison when supervision is revoked.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The public hearing on July 8 took up proposed rules to amend the DOC’s Administrative Code because of a law passed in April 2014, Act 196, that directs the creation of a system of appropriate short-term sanctions for violation of conditions of supervision. The law sets out  eight criteria, including minimizing the impact on the offender’s employment and family, and offers rewards for those complying with conditions of supervision.
Of the 18 members of the public who spoke at the hearing, most addressed the need for implementing the spirit of the 2014 law to create a less burdensome system of community supervision and reduce the number of revocations that in 2023 represented over 30% of those entering prison and in 2024 reached nearly 60%.
Several people who had been on community supervision or were still serving on supervision also spoke and asked that the DOC do more than just provide accountability and make the system less oppressive and also offer resources, such as help obtaining housing.
One of the first to speak was Tom Gilbert, an advocate for WISDOM, a statewide network working on reform of the prison and criminal justice systems and other social justice issues. Gilbert, whose son has twice had supervision revoked, has been pushing since 2019 for the DOC to implement Act 196.
“Act 196 is a good law passed with broad bipartisan support, and it calls for a cultural shift in how the Department of Corrections administers its supervision programs,” he said. 
“For many years, WISDOM has called on the department to implement the law and thereby provide a solid alternative to thousands of revocations each year,” he added.

However, Gilbert said, when he read DOC’s proposed rules for implementing the law he was upset that the DOC only stated the eight criteria without creating or describing a system for “new and revised policies and practices.”
Gilbert accused the DOC of not wanting to fulfill the intent of the law.
“This cannot be an oversight. It is a conscious omission,” he said. “To me, it signals that the DOC is not committed to creating a system of short-term sanctions, that it is not serious about shifting the community corrections program from an operation that sabotages the successful reentry of people into their communities to an operation that is focused on healing individuals, families and communities by providing the treatments and supports needed to accomplish that goal.”










People on supervision are trying to live. We're parenting, working, healing and giving back, but we live in fear that one misstep will erase years of progress. You have a chance to change that, to lead with justice instead of fear.


– Marianne Oleson, operations director for Ex Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO)


Gilbert challenged the DOC’s current protocol of calling 90 days of jail a short-term sanction because, he said, even 60, 30, 21, or 14 days in jail has a negative impact on employment and family.
He also challenged the DOC’s perspective that the rules revision would only impact those on community supervision, vendors and DOC staff.
 “The decisions you and your agents make every day regarding people under your supervision widely affect families, employers, health care providers, social service providers, schools — in  other words, whole communities and this whole state,” Gilbert said. “The proposed rules should be revised by adding back the language from Act 196 that explains its whole purpose — creating a system of short-term sanctions.”

Sean Wilson, senior director of organizing and partnership of Dream.Org, a national non-profit working on social justice issues, was also critical of the proposed rule for offering no description for short-term sanctions.
“There’s no real short-term sanctions framework,” Wilson said. “Instead of building a system that redirects people before they spiral back into incarceration, this proposal simply restates the existing law; meanwhile, revocations without new convictions in Wisconsin still account for 40% of our prison admissions.” (The rate rose from 40% early in 2024 to nearly 60% at the end of the year)
“Here in this state, there are no guardrails to prevent over-punishment,” Wilson added. “The proposal leaves full revocation on the table for things like substance abuse, missed check-ins, minor violations that are far too often treated as major. There’s no real focus on rehabilitation. There’s no clear investment in helping people reintegrate successfully, and no mention of support, supportive services, trauma-informed care, or reentry pathways.”
He said the rules are “vague about how sanctions will be applied, who will review them, and how racial disparities, which are deeply embedded in our system, will be addressed.”
He also raised concerns about private contractors offering supervision, creating a “financial incentive that undermines fairness and accountability.”
Carol Rubin, a former administrative judge, also encouraged the implementation of Act 196 and was also critical of the proposed rules not fleshing out the intent of the 2014 law.
“I want to express my dismay that DOC has delayed issuing formal rules for Act 196 for 11 years, despite being ordered to issue rules in 2014 by the Wisconsin Legislature,” she said. “In the meantime, thousands of individuals have been denied the benefit of a real, short-term sanction system with trained agents that could have stabilized their new lives in the community.”
Rubin said the DOC should provide examples of how short-term sanctions should be employed to minimize the impact on employment.
“For a low violation, consider imposing a short-term sanction that does not restrict the hours that a client could be available for employment, such as a verbal or written reprimand,” she said. “For a medium or high violation, consider a brief house arrest or weekend jail sanction of two days or less that will not interfere with the client’s current or future hours of employment; if appropriate, a weekend home arrest could be repeated.”
Liz Monroe noted that the DOC’s manual for Evidence Based Response to Violations (EBRV) has two mentions of using rewards, including stating that rewards are “more effective than only using sanctions” and that incentives and rewards are “helpful for compliance and positive behaviour and that there should be at least four rewards for every sanction.”
As a reward for compliance, she encouraged reducing the supervision time, such as 30 days of compliance resulting in 30 fewer days on supervision.
Barbie Jackson, vice president of MOSES, an affiliate of WISDOM, asked for a description that “clearly defines short-term sanctions to assure that they focus on helping people avoid harmful behaviors and fulfill societal obligations, minimize disruption of the impacted person’s employment, minimize the effect on the impacted person’s family and establish incentives and rewards for compliance and positive behavior.”
Jeremy Dings, who said he had been originally sentenced to five years in prison but ended up serving 12 because of two revocations, talked about how he was unable to help his family during a health crisis after he broke a rule and was revoked. He was allso not allowed to attend his mother’s funeral.

“People on supervision have families, too, just like all of you,” he said. “Revocation for rule violation ends the person’s employment and their ability to support their family and themselves.”
Marianne Oleson, operations director for Ex Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO), noted she had been on supervision for eight years and still had 18 more years to serve.
“I’ve rebuilt my life. Started over with nothing, and dedicated myself to helping others,” she said, “but despite everything I’ve done, I wake up every day with 18 more years of supervision ahead of me, not because I’ve reoffended, not because I’m a danger, but because the system has failed to evolve with science.”
She contended that recent research on community supervision says the ideal period is three to five years.
Oleson noted that her clients include many who have been revoked and sent back to prison for a technical rule violation. 
She said the present system often does not have the goal of rehabilitation but “surveillance disguised as support.”
“People on supervision are trying to live,” said Oleson. “We’re parenting, working, healing and giving back, but we live in fear that one misstep will erase years of progress. You have a chance to change that, to lead with justice instead of fear. Please rewrite this to reflect what the courts, the research and those of us directly impacted are telling you. Our futures matter. Please treat us like they do and we do.”
JenAnn Bauer of West Bend who had been in prison and on supervision said that “excessive supervision” creates challenges for rebuilding a life.
“Every job, every lease, every new agent and every step forward comes with extra scrutiny and extra risk,” she said. “I have done everything the system has asked of me. I pay taxes, I’ve reintegrated, I’ve contributed. These things don’t just affect the formerly incarcerated. They affect our families, our children and future generations. When a parent is stuck under financial pressure or the constant threat of being sent back for a technical violation, it creates instability that reaches far beyond one individual, it holds entire families hostage and in survival mode, and that affects the health, safety and future of whole communities and our entire state.”

Robert Thibault, vice president of Prison Action in Milwaukee, said he had been on supervision for 15 years and had experienced a “huge inconsistency” in how supervision was administered depending on the parole or probation officer (PO), adding the attitude of a PO over the interpretation of “arbitrary rules” could result in a revocation.
Meah Flowers of Madison talked of having family members going in and out of prison and the disruption that revocation causes. She encouraged implementing Act 196 to help families.
Eric Howland said there is an expectation that those coming into community supervision obtain employment, housing and a positive social network, but a 90- or 60-day jail sentence for a supervision violation negatively impacts those goals.
Why 11 years?
The DOC has not yet responded to questions from the Examiner on why it has taken 11 years to implement Act 196.

(Courtesy of Bernalillo County)Two officials representing county governments say the State of New Mexico owes local governments millions of dollars for unreimbursed jail expenses.
But while lawmakers passed legislation in 2007 requiring the state to reimburse county jails for incarcerating state prisoners, officials contend the state has not made sufficient contributions.
For instance, according to a recent presentation to the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee by Grace Phillips, risk management director for the New Mexico County Insurance Authority, between June 2023 and July 2024, the 25 counties with jails spent $383 million on operations, but only received $4.6 million in reimbursement from the state — approximately 1.2% — of the cost. 
Phillips characterized that amount as “puny” and said it only covers half the cost resulting from detaining people who are in the legal custody of the Corrections Department.
Over the past seven years, this “state reimbursement shortfall” has totaled more than $45.3 million, according to the presentation.
Phillips said the gap between what the state is legally obligated to pay and what the Legislature has set aside “has really gotten out of control.”
“The cost of detention is staggering when you think about what county budgets are like as opposed to the state,” she said. “We’re much smaller than the state, and we spend an extraordinary proportion of that budget on detention facilities.”
Katherine Carroll, a lobbyist for the nonprofit NM Counties, told the committee that over the last five years, her organization has been unable to gain any traction with lawmakers about increasing reimbursements.
Carroll said she has raised the concerns with Legislative Finance Committee staff over the last couple of years, but by the end of each legislative session, they tell her “there’s just not enough money there to reimburse the counties for housing state inmates.”
The Legislature passed the county jail reimbursement law shortly after the New Mexico Court of Appeals sided with San Miguel County in a lawsuit against the Corrections Department. The court said the state must pay when someone in its custody is held in a local jail, even if the Legislature’s appropriation to the Corrections Department provided insufficient funds for doing so.
Committee Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces) pushed back at Carroll’s contention that staff told her the state had insufficient funds for reimbursement:
“Nobody elected the staff,” he said. “They elected us, and they elected the governor who passed a law that says you’re supposed to get reimbursed, and you don’t get reimbursed. So who made the staff king? I don’t understand that.”
So if the state isn’t going to reimburse the counties, Cervantes contended, lawmakers should change the law to reflect that, or the counties should sue to enforce the law as it stands.
“I would tell you to sue — maybe that’s the callous attitude of a lawyer, but we have courts and we have the law for a reason,” he said. “When you say ‘owed,’ are you planning to do something about this? Or is it just to make us feel bad for you?”
Carroll told Cervantes her organization has been discussing the possibility of litigation for the past year, but had hoped the presentation to the committee might trigger lawmakers’ assistance.
“Other than that, I guess the counties would have to look at a second lawsuit regarding this issue,” she said.

His attorney argues Cherry and Felix fell through the cracks of state foster care and court systems designed to protect them. The image is of a 2023 candlelight vigil in Topeka honoring child victims of homicide. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An attorney representing Mickel Cherry in the rape and murder of a 5-year-old Topeka girl asserted in a court document Friday that Kansas’ child welfare agency and the Shawnee County District Attorney’s Office missed opportunities to intervene and possibly save her life.
Cherry, a former Texas resident who entered a guilty plea last year to murder and sexual assault charges to avoid the death penalty, confessed to killing Zoey Felix in October 2023 at a tent encampment used by homeless people. Zoey was left in Cherry’s care by the girl’s father while he was at work.
Defense counsel Peter Conley, a state deputy capital defender, said in court documents that Felix’s welfare was investigated seven separate times by the Kansas Department for Children and Families in the year before her death. After a DUI charge against the girl’s mother, Conley said, DCF informed District Attorney Mike Kagay’s office that evidence indicated Felix’s mother engaged in abuse or neglect of the girl.
The district attorney eventually began child-in-need-of-care proceedings, but Felix died before the legal system advanced the case to a point where she could be placed in state custody and potentially placed in the foster care system. Instead of the promise of safety, Felix was strangled by Cherry, who had endured years of abuse from his mother before placed in the Texas foster care system from age 5 to 18.
Conley’s filing on behalf of the 27-year-old Cherry says his client had to bear ultimate responsibility for raping and killing Felix, but the case raised important issues.
“Kansas had multiple opportunities to protect her from the harm she endured,” Conley wrote in the court document. “While it is easy and tempting to place all the blame on Mickel Cherry, we must also confront a harder truth. The systems designed to protect children failed her. Not because they lacked authority, but because we have tolerated that failure. Our systems can save children. We must expect, and demand, that they do.”
He said Felix’s murder was “entirely avoidable” and that “multiple moments of intervention were present that could have saved her.”
A DCF spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment about the defense attorney’s court filing and the pending sentencing of Cherry.
 
Trainwreck of trauma
The document outlining DCF’s involvement with Felix as well as Cherry’s own life experience in foster care was filed by Conley in preparation for sentencing at a Shawnee County District Court hearing scheduled to start Monday. Cherry pleaded guilty to first-degree felony murder and rape of a child in December.
Conley requested Cherry be ordered to serve two concurrent 25-year-to-life sentences in prison. In that were the result, Cherry wouldn’t be eligible for release until after serving a quarter century behind bars.
On behalf of the district attorney’s office, Kagay recommended two life sentences for the murder and rape to be served consecutively. That would create a minimum 50-year term in prison before consideration of parole.
If released from the Kansas Department of Corrections in the future, Cherry would be subject to civil commitment at a state psychiatric hospital under Kansas laws applied to sexually violent predators.
Conley’s supplement to the court record said it was an “open secret that those (former foster) children, abused and neglected, become the majority of defendants and victims in our legal system.” He said the Cherry case was a “trainwreck of childhood trauma and institutional indifference.”
He wrote that it was troubling a homeless and developmentally disabled Texan who spent much of his childhood in a foster care system that was ruled by the courts to be “constitutionally inadequate” and where “rape, abuse, psychotropic medication and instability were the norm” came to occupy a makeshift camp with Felix and her father.
He posed questions about how Felix, known to be chronically truant from preschool, found by police wandering Topeka streets, subject of multiple DCF investigations and on the district attorney’s radar, fell through the cracks of a system that could have removed her from unsafe living conditions.
In September 2022, Conley’s court document says, DCF received the first report concerning Felix residing with her mother, who was allegedly abusing drugs and the victim of domestic violence. DCF closed that case after the mother refused to participate in the state’s voluntary family preservation program. On a scale forecasting the “lasting safety” of a family, DCF gave Felix’s home environment a nine on the 10-point scale with 10 reflecting confidence the problems were no more serious than those of a typical family.
Less than two months later, Topeka police were called to help locate Felix at 2:42 a.m. She was found at a house a block away. Law enforcement officers returned the girl to her mother and reported to DCF the mother could be neglecting Felix.
A Topeka school contacted DCF in November 2022 to report Felix had missed 25 days of school during the fall part of the academic year. The document filed by Conley said it wasn’t clear if the school or DCF referred the truancy to the district attorney’s office.
On Nov. 18, 2022, DCF was informed Felix’s mother was arrested for DUI after a traffic accident in which Felix was sitting unbuckled in the front seat of the vehicle. Felix was placed in police protective custody until released to her father.
 
‘Case was closed’
Despite four cases raising questions about Felix’s well-being, Conley’s filing said, DCF records didn’t indicate whether the state agency sought to confirm the father’s ability to care for Felix.
In May 2023, DCF received a report that indicated Felix’s father had been evicted from his home and the girl was back in the care of her mother, who had been released from jail on the DUI charge and placed on probation. At this point, in June 2023, DCF issued a finding of “lack of supervision” regarding Felix. That was apparently shared with the district attorney’s office, but child-in-need-of-care proceedings weren’t immediately initiated.
The district attorney subsequently launched that proceeding on Felix’s behalf to determine whether she was abused, neglected or otherwise unsafe. DCF continued to give a score of nine out of 10 on the “lasting safety” scale applied to Felix, the court document said.
DCF was again notified in August 2023 — two months before Felix’s death — that the girl was living with her mother in a house without running water. The report said the girl didn’t have shoes, was wearing the same clothes every day and was “outside around the neighborhood for hours at a time.”
“DCF sent an investigator to the house seven times in September, but no one was ever home. The case was closed,” Corley wrote in the court document.
In fact, he wrote, Felix was now relying on her father for parental care and was closer to falling victim to Cherry at the homeless camp.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/plaza-vigil-bw-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-11 18:12:01.783608

An autopsy determined that the woman who was found dead this week at her home in Pittsford died from a “gunshot wound of head and neck,” according to Vermont State Police.
However, the manner of 41-year-old Erica Bovey’s death remains “pending,” according to a Thursday press release from state police. 
An earlier state police press release from Wednesday termed the death as “suspicious.” 
Police began their investigation into Bovey’s death around 2:10 a.m. Wednesday after authorities received a call from a resident at a home on Hollister Quarry Road in Pittsford reporting that a person there had died. 
First responders who arrived at the scene confirmed that the person, later identified as Bovey, who also lived at the home, was deceased, according to police.

Asked why the manner of Bovey’s death was listed as pending, police spokesperson Adam Silverman replied in an email Friday, “cause and manner of death are determinations of the medical examiner’s office.”
Silverman added, “VSP’s investigation remains active and ongoing at this time while we await further information from the medical examiner.”
No one was in custody related to the investigation as of Friday afternoon, Silverman said.
Kyle Casteel, a spokesperson for the Vermont Department of Health, the state department in which the Vermont’s Chief Medical Examiner’s is located, declined to comment specifically on Bovey’s case and why the manner of death was still listed as pending. 
“I can share that in general, it takes time to establish the manner of death in an investigation, and the record will be updated when the facts are confirmed,” Casteel said in an email.

Bill Mercer, R-Billings, speaks during a floor session of the House on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. (Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)Former U.S. attorney and legislator Bill Mercer has been nominated to serve as U.S. District Court judge in Montana.
President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, Thursday evening that he had selected Mercer, a Republican in the state House of Representatives, to fill the open spot on the federal district court bench. 
“Bill has TREMENDOUS experience, previously serving at the Department of Justice and, as United States Attorney for the District of Montana,” Trump wrote in a post. “He is STRONG and SMART, will fearlessly uphold the Rule of Law, and defend our Constitution on the Federal Bench.”
Mercer, 61, was born in Billings. He holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Montana, a master’s in public administration from Harvard University, and earned his law degree from George Mason University. Mercer has worked at Holland & Hart law firm since 2010. 
Mercer was the Montana U.S. Attorney from 2001-’09, during the President George W. Bush administration.
Mercer was elected to  the Montana House in 2019, where he has served four terms. This session, Mercer carried 25 bills the governor signed into law. Much of his legislation the past session was focused on medical issues, as well as protections for children and elderly adults.
“Bill is a man of integrity, principle and deep legal expertise,” House Speak Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said in a press release. “His decades of experience — as U.S. Attorney, federal prosecutor, and state legislator – have uniquely prepared him for this important role.”
Mercer’s appointment has to be approved by the U.S. Senate. Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy congratulated Mercer in a joint statement. 
“Bill’s experience at the Department of Justice as U.S. Attorney for Montana and his fierce advocacy for the rule of law and original interpretation of the Constitution will be tremendous assets as he serves the country and the people of Montana on the federal bench,” the joint statement read. “We will work diligently with Senate leadership and our colleagues to confirm Bill’s nomination.”
It’s unclear who Mercer will replace, as two of the three federal judges in the state — all of whom are Obama appointees — have requested what’s called “senior status,” meaning they’re still eligible to hear federal cases, but at a reduced workload. To qualify, judges must be at least 65 years old and have served at least 10 years as a federal judge. 
The judge’s age and service years as a federal judge must add up to 80. As long as certain stipulations are met, judges keep their chambers and law clerks, as well as a salary.
Montana U.S. District Judge Susan Watters — the first woman to be presidentially appointed as a federal judge in Montana — announced her retirement to senior status last month. Watters, who will retire in June of next year, was appointed to the position in 2013.
Watters graduated from Eastern Montana College (Now Montana State University Billings) in 1980 before a master’s degree and then graduating from law school at the University of Montana. Watters was also a district court judge for 15 years and worked in the Yellowstone County Attorney’s office.
All three presidentially appointed Montana federal judges joined the bench during the Obama administration. Judge Dana L. Christensen announced plans in 2022 to move to senior status and will move there once his successor is appointed. 
The Biden administration moved to nominate Danna Jackson, an attorney for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, who would have been the first Native American federal judge in the state had she been confirmed. She was not, and it is unclear what the status of that seat is, or how quickly President Trump will move to fill it.

Deb Fischer says she steered $17.5 million to Nebraska in Senate ag funding bill,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/07/11/u-s-sen-deb-fischer-says-she-steered-17-5-million-to-nebraska-in-senate-ag-funding-bill/,"The Senate ag funding bill is at odds with Trump, who wants to cut spending on USDA and FDA for the next fiscal year.","U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., speaks during a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (Senate webcast)LINCOLN — Nebraska could see $17.5 million in federal funds for construction of a U.S. Department of Agriculture research facility and the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., touted the potential funding in a press release this week, describing the budding UNL’s Agricultural Research Service facility as “a hub for world-class agricultural innovation.”
The federal money for Nebraska is part of a larger Senate agriculture funding bill, which was advanced unanimously Thursday by the Appropriations Committee, on which Fischer serves. The Senate ag funding bill would increase spending for agricultural programs by 1% over current levels. 
The USDA facility at UNL broke ground last year. The purpose of the $160 million facility is to find new ways to produce more food for a growing global population while using fewer natural resources. 
Funding for the facility, along with about $86 million in additional money for Nebraska, was removed from a GOP stopgap government funding bill in March. 
Fischer said she also secured provisions in the Senate ag-related spending bill prioritizing agricultural research at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Nebraska. The bill also would require the USDA to “streamline contracting and procurement services for livestock research facilities.”

That center endured the layoffs of 17 people as part of efforts to cut federal spending by the then-Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency earlier this year. 
The ag funding bill is one of 12 appropriations bills that Congress must pass yearly to fund the federal government. But the ag funding push could be contested as the Trump administration seeks to reduce spending for the next fiscal year, which starts in October.
President Donald Trump has asked Congress to reduce funding for the USDA by nearly $7 billion. In Trump’s funding request, spending on the Agricultural Research Service would be reduced by $159 million. 
The Trump budget request from May also seeks to reduce spending on other government agencies — except for defense and border enforcement. Some of the biggest requested cuts target foreign aid, climate-related funding and spending on programs the administration describes as “wokeism.”
While these White House budget requests are suggestions, Trump has a tight grip on the GOP in Congress and hasn’t ruled out using impoundment, basically his choosing not to spend the funds as a way to overrule Congress. 
Last month, the House passed its own version of the ag bill along party lines. That bill would reduce funding by 4 percent in the next fiscal year. The House bill spends roughly $25 billion, while the Senate version spends $27.1 billion. 
The deadline to avoid a government shutdown is Sept. 30.

But the amount of fecal matter lurking in the water surpassed federal safety recommendations at least one time in 2024 at nearly six in 10 of the 66 Rhode Island beaches tested, new data shows.

Even more alarming: 25 state and local beaches exceeded federal water quality safety thresholds on 25% or more of the testing days, according to a report published on July 7 by Environment America’s Research & Policy Center.
 “It’s absurd in today’s society we need to be worried about crap in the water, literally,” said Rex Wilmouth, state director for the Rhode Island chapter of the nonprofit research and advocacy firm. “Even one day is one day too many.”
Wilmouth unveiled the disturbing findings at a press conference at Oakland Beach in Warwick Friday morning. The Rhode Island Department of Health closed the city-run saltwater beach on June 24 due to high bacteria counts, though it was reopened two days later. On Thursday, two other Warwick swimming areas, at City Park and Conimicut Point beaches, were closed due to high bacteria accounts detected by the Rhode Island Department of Health.
The state health department samples and tests water at state and local saltwater beaches during the summer season each year and notifies the public if unsafe bacteria levels are detected. Swimming in contaminated water can cause gastrointestinal illnesses, respiratory disease, eye and ear infections and skin rashes, with an estimated 57 million cases of illness nationwide each year. However, a majority of the illnesses go unreported.
Environment America’s report compares state and federally reported levels of fecal contamination against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s health safety threshold, or Beach Action Value, to determine which beaches may pose health risks to swimmers, and how often. 
Of the 3,187 beaches tested nationwide in 2024, 61% showed unsafe levels of contamination on at least one testing day. And one in seven of those tested were marked by dangerous levels of bacteria at least 25% of testing days.

And that’s just on days when waters were sampled — suggesting infected waterways were contaminated even more often than data suggests, Wilmouth said. Take Tiverton’s Fogland Beach, for example, which surpassed the federally recommended bacteria cap on five of seven days it was tested in 2024.
“There were a lot more days it was probably unsafe as well,” Wilmouth said. 
Other repeat offenders in 2024 included Matunuck Town Beach in South Kingstown and Jamestown’s Mackerel Cove Beach, which both exceeded recommended bacteria levels on roughly two-thirds of testing days, along with Narragansett’s members-only Dune’s Club. State-run beaches were not immune either: Scarborough State Beach North showed unsafe levels of bacteria on 38% of the 24 testing days, according to the data.

Water pollution has become an increasing problem nationwide as a result of development that increases the risk of stormwater runoff flowing into coastal waters, and aging sewer infrastructure prone to overflows and spills. 
In 2024, Rhode Island saw 171 days of one or more beach closures over a beach season marked by nearly 15 inches of rain, according to state health department data. The year 2023 was marked by 246 days of one or more beach closures — the highest since 2006, when there were 351 closure days.
So far this year, five local beaches have been closed for a combined 22 days — not including this week’s closures at swimming areas that have not yet reopened in the wake of recent, heavy rainfall.

Temporary beach closures are more than just an inconvenience to swimmers; they also jeopardize a key part of the state’s tourism-dependent economy, and that of shellfishermen, whose livelihoods depend on access to key fishing grounds free from contamination. 
“We’re the Ocean State,” Wilmouth said. “We need to make sure we are not polluting our waterways.”
The solution relies largely on federal and state funding, both for regular water quality monitoring, and even more importantly, sewage and stormwater infrastructure upgrades that can minimize overflows and prevent polluted runoff from seeping into public waterways. The 2021 Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act provided $27.4 billion in direct funding and future appropriations for sewage and stormwater projects nationwide. But some of that funding is now at risk under actions taken by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the EPA pegs the total cost for necessary wastewater infrastructure at $630 billion.
Environment America’s annual data release on unsafe bacteria levels in swimming waters comes with a new call to action this year: asking residents in each state to sign a petition urging their governors to set firm deadlines for ensuring state waters are safe for swimming, fulfilling a goal set by the Clean Water Act in 1983.
The number of people who signed the petition in Rhode Island Friday was not immediately available.
Wilmouth acknowledged the progress that Rhode Island, and its municipalities, have made toward wastewater infrastructure upgrades, such as the Narragansett Bay Commission’s Combined Sewer Overflow project. Now in its third and final phase, the decades-old, $1.7 billion project relies on a network of underground tunnels that will run over 5 miles once completed to capture sewage and stormwater runoff during heavy rainfall and prevent it from being released untreated into the bay. The project is expected to be finished in 2026.
“We need to continue doing things like that,” Wilmouth said of the federally funded project. “The biggest thing is having the funding. These are not small, or inexpensive projects.”
But, he added, the health risks to swimmers from frolicking in fecal waters are preventable.
“I shouldn’t be releasing a report like this in today’s world,” he said.

Pictured is Glenns Lake in Glacier National Park (Photo by Jeff Pang via Glacier National Park and Flickr | CC-BY-SA 2.0).Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has filed a motion for the state to intervene in a federal climate change lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Montana last year.
Knudsen is leading a coalition of 18 other Republican state Attorneys General, and the Territory in Guam, in filing as defendants in the lawsuit that alleges three of President Donald Trump’s executive orders to  “unleash” the fossil fuel industry, and remove climate protections, threaten the constitutional rights to life and liberty of the plaintiffs.
The lawsuit, filed in May, centers on 22 young plaintiffs, led by 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, from Livingston. Lighthiser is one of several Montana plaintiffs who also filed the landmark Held v. Montana lawsuit, alleging several state policies violated their constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment. The Held case prevailed in Montana District Court and, in late 2024, the Montana Supreme Court.
Lighthiser says the president is “waging war” on her and her co-plaintiffs, and that the federal government’s actions amount to a “death sentence for my generation.” 
“President Trump’s (executive orders)s falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” according to the 126-page complaint. “These unconstitutional directives have the immediate effect of slowing the buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure that eliminates planet-heating fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution … and increasing the use of fossil fuels that pollute the air, water, lands, and climate on which Plaintiffs’ lives depend.”
Knudsen, whose office lost its case defending Montana in the Held lawsuit, said in court documents that Montana, and the additional states, “have unique interests in this case because it threatens their economies, the use of their properties, and their state budgets.”
“President Donald J. Trump’s Executive Orders unleashing American energy have already provided tremendous benefits to the State Intervenors and their millions of citizens, as well as the promise and hope for a more prosperous, strong, and peaceful future, especially among those “forgotten” communities whose very livelihoods depend on a revival of America’s unparalleled energy sector,” according to court documents. 
The motion says that the plaintiffs in the case are “discontent with the policy positions of the new Administration when it comes to unleashing American energy-and the ensuing creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs and economic security for the State Intervenors and all Americans,” and made their complaint “based on alleged violations of ‘unenumerated liberty interests.’”
Because many of the plaintiffs are Montanans, and much of the original complaint specifically uses examples of alleged harms to the environment and economy in Montana, Knudsen’s cited the state’s interest in its own policies, economy and laws as an argument for inclusion. 
Knudsen’s brief states that if the states are allowed to join the lawsuit, they will file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit by Aug. 4.
The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment from the Daily Montanan. 
Representatives from Our Children’s Trust, one of the law firms representing the plaintiffs, said that the decision for the states to intervene in this case — out of more than 450 that have been filed challenging executive orders or federal actions —  indicates the significance, and threat, the lawsuit carries. 
“That speaks volumes,” said Julia Olsen, chief legal counsel at Our Children’s Trust. “These states see Lighthiser vs. Trump as the biggest legal threat to the fossil fuel executive orders that are harming children, worsening the climate crisis, and violating the Constitution. Instead of protecting the health and safety of young people, these states are lining up to defend orders that unleash more fossil fuel pollution, silence science, and dismantle safeguards passed by Congress.
“The evidence will show not only that President Trump’s policies will harm these young plaintiffs and expose them to more life-threatening flood, fire, and heat events, but that they are wholly unnecessary for the energy and prosperity needs of our nation,”Along with Montana, the states of Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming —and the U.S. Territory of Guam — joined the motion to intervene, represented by their respective Attorneys General. 
A two-day combined evidentiary hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction and the federal government’s forthcoming motion to dismiss is set for Sept. 16–17, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana in Missoula, Montana.

(Image courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Pheasant hunters in Iowa saw high-bag years in both 2023 and 2024.
Harvest data for the fall season released by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shows an estimated 460,000 roosters were bagged in the 2024 season, making it the second-best pheasant season in nearly two decades. 
The 2024 season had lower figures than 2023, when hunters logged 590,000 harvested roosters. But DNR said this was expected, as the August 2024 population surveys of the birds showed a 14% decline in populations compared to 2023. 
Todd Bogenschutz, upland wildlife biologist with DNR, said there were more than 77,400 hunters chasing pheasants in 2024, which was fewer than the 83,600 hunters in 2023.
Of the other pheasant-hunting states, only South Dakota had higher 2024 bags and hunters with 1.3 million roosters harvested by about 140,200 hunters. 
Historic records of Iowa pheasant seasons show similarly high hunting years as recent as 1995. Populations have declined since then due to “catastrophic” weather years from 2007-2011 and fewer acres enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program, which provides needed habitat for the birds. 
According to 2024 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the CRP program, 1.67 million acres were enrolled in the program that pays farmers to convert marginal cropland to grasslands. 
That means there’s less pheasant habitat today than in 1995, when over 2 million acres were enrolled in CRP and hunters bagged more than 1.4 million roosters. But it’s better than some years in Iowa’s 100-year pheasant hunting history. 
Squirrel, rabbit harvest increases
The department also shared figures for other small game in 2024. Quail hunters harvested 27,500 birds, which was 2,700 fewer than 2023. Rabbit harvests in 2024 increased by 13% from 2023, with an estimated 77,000 harvested. Squirrel hunting also increased in 2024 and hunters bagged more than 124,300, which was 32% higher than 2023 figures.
Like the other bird hunting categories, mourning dove harvests were also down slightly from 2023 harvests, with an estimated 143,000 doves bagged.
In August, DNR staff will drive down thousands of miles of gravel roads at dawn to count female pheasants, or hens, as they move their broods out of the dew to dry off. These figures will give the department an idea of pheasant populations going into the 2025 pheasant season, which kicks off Oct. 18 for youth hunters. 
“Overall we had a really good fall and are looking forward to this year’s August roadside survey to see where the bird numbers are ahead of the 2025 season,” Bogenschutz said in a statement.
The roadside survey results are typically released to the public in September, but early predictors show pheasant populations might benefit from the state’s “fourth least snowy” winter in 138 years, according to DNR. 
The department reported in June there were sightings of early nesting in regions around the state, which usually means there will be a higher numbers of pheasant chicks.
Bogenschutz said early nesting, combined with favorable weather predictions, could mean higher pheasant populations and therefore hunting abilities for the 2025 season. 
DNR and Iowa Pheasants Forever created a “hard card” hunting and fishing license with a pheasant print for hunters to celebrate the 2025, centennial season of the sport.

Kelly Armstrong. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers are unlikely to take the executive branch to court over a disagreement over the governor’s veto power, Legislative Management members indicated Friday.
The dispute arose in May, after the legislative session, when Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s office accidentally appeared to line-item veto $35 million in housing funding.
Armstrong had intended to veto $150,000 the 2025 Legislature set aside for a Native American homelessness liaison, but a staff member mistakenly also crossed out $25 million for affordable housing and $10 million for homelessness in a markup of the bill.
Lawmakers weigh possible legal action, special session to address veto error

The Attorney General’s Office last month issued an opinion finding that the inadvertent markup  was not an issue because Armstrong had been sufficiently clear about what he intended to veto in his memo, and so the Legislature need not take further action.
Legislative Council, in its own analysis, disagreed. Attorneys argued Wrigley’s opinion conflicts  with previous rulings by the North Dakota Supreme Court, the constitution and a prior attorney general’s opinion and said the Legislature could consider holding a special session and override the veto to free up the $34.85 million.
Regardless, the Office of Management and Budget already allocated the money. The agency in an email earlier this week confirmed it dispersed the $34.85 million to the Housing Finance Agency on July 1.
But lawmakers indicated Friday that their concerns go beyond just money.

Even if the veto is overridden in a special session, the attorney general’s opinion would still stand. Both Legislative Council and lawmakers said the opinion could give the executive branch too much power over how vetoes they consider ambiguous are interpreted in the future.
“I guess the question is that, if we did a special session to override the veto, it’s just a Band-Aid. It isn’t addressing the concerns of, ‘What is a veto and what isn’t?’” said Sen. Ronald Sorvaag, R-Fargo.
Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said if the Legislature wants more clarity on the governor’s veto authority, it has two main options: it could ask the North Dakota Supreme Court to weigh in by moving forward with a lawsuit, or it could amend the underlying law.
Members of Legislative Management on Friday seemed more apt to do the latter. 
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said a legal challenge could leave the millions of dollars for housing and combating homelessness tied up while the lawsuit plays out.
“I think the risk of jeopardizing the money that’s actually providing service to people is so great that I don’t think we should seek the Supreme Court ruling at this point,” Hogan said during the meeting. 
Legislative Management voted to direct the Legislative Procedures and Arrangements Committee to come up with a plan to study how the Legislature and executive branch can clarify the process for vetoes, including those issued after the session adjourns. The committee also was asked to analyze the attorney general’s opinion. Legislative Procedures and Arrangements will meet and report back to Legislative Management within 90 days with their first steps, lawmakers said Friday.
“This may take a little work,” Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, chair of the Legislative Procedures and Arrangements Committee, said during the meeting.
The Legislature could prepare a bill for consideration during the 2027 legislative session. Or, if lawmakers convene for a special session before that, they could vote on the legislation at that time.
The meeting agenda included a closed-door executive session, but the committee held its entire discussion in an open meeting.
Wrigley after the meeting said he had no issue with the prospect of lawmakers amending the law to make veto procedures more specific, but cautioned them to make sure the policy respects the veto authority granted to the governor under the constitution.
Redistricting lawsuit
Lawmakers on Friday also discussed how a pending voting rights lawsuit against North Dakota could affect legislators representing districts 9 and 15. The plaintiffs — the Spirit Lake Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and three Indigenous North Dakotans — are gearing up to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case after receiving an unfavorable ruling from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.
The group filed the lawsuit in 2022, arguing that a 2021 redistricting plan was discriminatory because it diluted the power of Native voters.
The 8th Circuit’s judgment, expected to be filed sometime next week, is likely to change North Dakota’s district map back to the version legislators approved in 2021. This would result in three lawmakers no longer living in the districts they represent, which is forbidden under the state constitution.
North Dakota tribes want US Supreme Court to hear voting rights case

It’s still up in the air how the Legislature would respond to such a situation, lawmakers and Legislative Council staff said Friday. Members could allow their peers to serve out the remainder of their terms or vote to remove them from office.
The three affected lawmakers would be Rep. Collette Brown, D-Warwick, who would go from representing District 9 to District 15; Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, who would switch from District 15 to District 9B; and Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, who would switch from District 15 to District 9.
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, celebrated the 8th Circuit’s decision and indicated she would support having affected members removed and replaced with people who reside in the amended districts.
“As sad as it might be for some of our colleagues in those districts, I think we have a constitutional duty,” Myrdal said.
Rep. LaurieBeth Hager, D-Fargo, said that the committee should be mindful of how such a decision would affect their colleagues.
“This is their job, their livelihood, their benefit plan,” she said.

“North Dakota’s military members are at the heart of this gallery,” Armstrong said. He added members of all five North Dakota tribal nations have been part of an advisory committee to incorporate and plan to showcase the history of the state’s Indigenous service members and warrior culture. 
Robert Hunter Sr., director of veterans affairs for the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and an Army veteran, said the museum will be important for Native Americans who have served in the military to have a place where their stories can inspire the next generation.
“I believe it’s great for tourism because you get to see a rich history of North Dakotans, but also the tribes that were here before them,” Hunter said. “That’s just a rich history that can’t be forgotten.” 
Hunter said he is most excited to see the memorial wall at the completed gallery to honor the veterans who have fallen in combat.

Construction is expected to start within the next month with completion estimated for 2027, said Brian Berg, architect for Zerr Berg Architects, the principal designers for the gallery.
The total cost of the gallery project should be under the budget of $78 million, said Bill Peterson, director of the State Historical Society of North Dakota. About half of the project is expected to be paid for through private donations and the other half from state funds or lines of credit through the Bank of North Dakota.
Willie Rose of Bismarck, a Vietnam-era veteran who served in the Air Force for 19 years, said he came to the groundbreaking to see some of his veteran friends. He added he hopes the Military Gallery will be held in the same respect as honor flights that transport veterans to Washington, D.C., to see the country’s military monuments.

“Just seeing people here, it’s so amazing to see that people really do care about veterans and what they’ve been through,” Rose said.
Dusty Olson of Parshall, an Army veteran, said knowing the stories of the past can help make a brighter future for service members and veterans.
“My folks used to say, ‘Do it better than we did,’ and this is the same scenario, or maybe add onto it,” Olson said.

Tory Richardson, president and CEO of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority, in a statement, said the airport’s governing body was grateful to Scholten and the FAA for their continued support.
“This funding allows us to move forward with critical infrastructure projects that will enhance safety, improve efficiency, and support future growth,” Richardson said. 
The grant funding will most pointedly support phase one design work for upgrades aimed at improving safety, extending the life of existing facilities and increasing airport capacity to meet growing regional demand. The rehabilitation of the airport’s Taxiway V – a critical primary connection between the terminal apron and the airfield for commercial aircraft – would also be supported by the funding. Rehabbing the taxiway will extend its useful life by at least 10 years, Scholten’s office said.
Two other taxiways would be addressed with the grant. One taxiway will have its lighting reconstructed, ensuring reliability, safety and efficiency, while another would be extended to accommodate additional based aircraft, a means for future growth.
The construction of another taxiway, which is in the plan, would allow for additional hangar developments.

Four screenings are scheduled between Saturday, July 12, and Aug. 15. The first 100 people at each event will receive a private, on-site screening from dermatologists or dermatology residents affiliated with Brown. No registration is needed and those who need additional care will receive referrals for follow-up appointments.

“One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime,” Dr. John C. Kawaoka, an associate professor of dermatology and residency program director at Brown’s Warren Alpert Medical School, said in a statement. “Everyone is at risk, even those with darker skin tones…Every year we find a number of skin cancers, including melanoma, many of which people had no idea that they had.”
The health department recommends that participants wear bathing suits or easily removable clothing to allow doctors to examine areas of concern.
“Along with getting in the shade and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more, getting a skin check is the most important thing you can do to protect against skin cancer,” Rhode Island Department of Health Director Dr. Jerry Larkin said in a statement. “Cancer screenings have the power to save lives.” 
Local TV news outlet WJAR is the media partner and sponsor for the Skin Check events. Other partners include the Partnership to Reduce Cancer in Rhode Island, Brown University Health Community Health Institute and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). 
“Skin Check has a long history of providing free screenings to residents in our communities who need it most,” Megan Daniel, Executive Director of the Partnership to Reduce Cancer in Rhode Island, said in a statement. “It’s inspiring to see individuals and businesses who want to support this service and help reduce the burden of cancer in Rhode Island.” 
Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, and about one in five Americans will develop it at some point in their lives. Every day, an estimated 9,500 people are diagnosed with the disease.
Rhode Island falls slightly below the national average for melanoma of the skin, with 19.8 cases per 100,000 people compared to 22.7 nationally, per data from the National Cancer Institute that spans 2017 through 2021.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.
Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.
“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).
Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

But the leadership of Mississippi’s third-largest school district has decided that a new approach is in order, citing a series of incidents in recent years involving students using their cellphones to bully others, organize fights or text their parents inaccurate information about violence happening at or near their school.
“To be clear, it’s not the majority of our scholars, but I can’t look at a class and know who’s gonna be bullying today, who’s gonna be scheduling a meetup to cut up today,” Greene said toward the end of the hour-long meeting held at the JPS board room. “I can’t look at a group of scholars and say, ‘OK, yeah, you’re the one, let me take your phone, the rest of you can keep it.’”
Under the rewritten policy, students who take their phone out of their backpacks during the instructional day will lose it for five days for the first infraction, 10 days for the second and 45 days for the third. Currently, the longest the school will hold a phone is 10 days.
The Jackson school board is expected to consider the new policy at its meeting next week and the district hopes to implement the change when the new school year starts later this month, said Sherwin Johnson, the district’s communications director.
Students also currently have the option to pay up to a $25 fine to get their phone back, but the district wants to rescind that aspect of the policy. 
“We’ve discovered that’s not equitable,” said Larrisa Harris, the JPS general counsel. “Not everybody has the resources to come and pay the fine.”
Support for the new policy among the parents who spoke at the listening session varied, but all had questions. How will students access the internet on their laptops if the WiFi is spotty at their school and they need to use their cellphone hotspot? If students are required to keep their phones in their backpacks during lunch, how will teachers prevent stealing? How will JPS enforce the ban on using cellphones on the bus?
One mother said she watches her daughter’s location while she rides the bus to Jim Hill High School so she knows her daughter made it safely. 
“If they can’t have it on the bus, who’s gonna enforce that?” she said. “I’m just gonna be real, the bus driver got to drive.” 
A common theme among parents was anxiety at the prospect of losing direct contact with their kids in the event of an emergency. A Pew Research survey found that most adults, regardless of political affiliation, support cellphone bans in middle and high school classes. But those who don’t say it’s because their child can use their phone during emergencies.
“If something happened, will we get an automatic alert to notify us? Because a lot of the time we see things on social media first,” said Ashley McIntyre, a mother of three JPS students. She attended the meeting with her eldest daughter, Aaliyah, who recently graduated from Powell Middle School.
Though JPS does have an alert system for parents, McIntyre said she didn’t know if it existed. She cited a bomb threat at Powell last year that she found out about because Aaliyah texted her, not through a school alert. 
“We didn’t know what was going on, and she texted me, ‘Mom, I’m scared,’ so I went up there,” McIntyre said. “So that puts us on edge.” 
Aaliyah said she uses her phone to text her mom and watch TikTok, but she feels like her classmates use their phones to be popular or to fit in. When a fight happens, she said many students pull out their phones to record instead of trying to get an adult who can stop it. Then the videos end up on Instagram pages dedicated to posting fights in JPS. 
“Once the principal found out about the fight pages, they came around looking inside our videos and camera rolls,” she said. “It happened to me last year. They thought I had a fight on my phone.” 
Toward the end of the meeting, Laketia Marshall-Thomas, the assistant superintendent for high schools, took the mic to respond to one parent who said she was concerned that older students would not come to school if they knew their phone could be taken. 
“What we have seen is, it’s the older students—” Marshall-Thomas began. 
“They are the problem,” someone from the audience chimed in. 
“We’re not saying they cannot have them,” she continued. “We know that they have after school activities and they need to communicate with their moms … but we have had major, major issues with cellphones and issues that have even resulted in criminal outcomes for our scholars, but most importantly, our students … have experienced a lot of learning loss.” 
While the district leadership did not go into detail about the criminal incidents, several pointed to instances where students have texted their parents inaccurate information, such as an unsubstantiated rumor there was a gun during a fight at Callaway High School or that a shooting outside Whitten Middle School occurred on school property. 
“Having phones actually creates far more chaos than they help anyone,” Greene said. 
While cellphones have been banned to varying degrees in U.S. schools for decades, youth mental health concerns have renewed interest in more widespread bans across the country. Cellphone and social media usage among school-aged kids is linked to negative mental health outcomes and instances of cyberbullying, research shows.
At least 11 states restrict or ban cellphone use in schools. After Mississippi’s youth mental health task force recommended that all school districts implement policies that limited cellphone and social media usage in classrooms, a bill that would’ve required school boards to create cellphone policies died during the legislative session. Still, several Mississippi school districts have passed their own policies, including Marshall County and Madison County.
Another concern about the ban was a belief among a couple of speakers at the meeting that cellphones can help parents hold the district accountable for misdeeds it may want to hide. 
“I just saw a video today. It was not in JPS, but it was a child being yelled at by the teacher and had he not recorded it, his momma would have never known that this sweet lady that they go to church with is degrading her child like that,” one mother said. 
Statements like these prompted responses from teachers and other parents who urged the skeptical attendees to be more trusting or to make sure the district has updated contact information for them in case school officials need to reach parents during an emergency. 
“I think we have to trust the people watching over our children,” said one of the few fathers who spoke. “When I grew up, what the teacher said was gold.”

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Two years ago, Nicolle Orozco Forero walked into an in-home day care in Seattle, Washington, looking for a job. She was barely 22, a whole five feet tall — if that. But she was calm, focused. Her presence struck the owner, Stephanie Wishon, because it’s not easy to find qualified staff who can work with children with disabilities.
Orozco Forero had experience working with kids who had autism back in Colombia, so Wishon had her come in for a trial run and hired her after the first day. The children, who needed someone who had love and care to give in abundance, gravitated toward her. She was good at the hardest stuff. She changed diapers and outfits the moment they were soiled. She was vigilant; her kids stayed pristine. And she got them to do the things they wouldn’t do for other people, like say “ah” when it was time to get their teeth brushed or sit still long enough for her to twist a braid down their back.
Some people just have that way about them.
And people like Orozco Forero are exceptionally rare. Already, the staffing shortage in child care is near crisis levels. It’s far worse for children with disabilities — about a third of those families say they face significant difficulty finding care for their kids, partly because there are too few people with the ability, expertise or desire to work with their children. Immigrant women like Orozco Forero have been helping to fill that void. They now make up 20 percent of all child care workers.
At home, Orozco Forero was also caring for her own young boys, one of whom started to show symptoms of a serious illness over the past two years that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose. She took some time off to care for him last year, before returning to the kids at Wishon’s day care.
Her work has kept an already precarious safety net together. Without women like Orozco Forero, families who have nowhere else to turn for care have to make difficult decisions about how to survive and keep their children safe. Without her, the safety net snaps.
And that’s exactly what happened on June 18, the day she was detained.

It was supposed to be a routine meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Orozco Forero and her husband had been to all their monthly meetings for the past year and change, since their asylum charge was denied in April 2024.
The family — Orozco Forero; her husband, Juan Sebastian Moreno Acosta; and their two sons, Juan David, 7, and Daniel, 5 — fled Colombia two years ago. Moreno Acosta, a street vendor, had been persecuted by gangs who target vendors for money.
After arriving in the United States, they sought the help of a lawyer with their asylum claim, but when they couldn’t pay his full fee ahead of their hearing, he pulled out. They represented themselves in court and lost the case. With no knowledge of the U.S. court system, they didn’t know they had 30 days to appeal the ruling, either. Ever since, ICE has been monitoring them, requiring they wear a wrist tracker and meet with an immigration officer once a month, sometimes more, according to a family member. (The 19th is not naming the family member to protect their identity.) It’s unclear why ICE has allowed them to stay in the country all this time, though it’s not necessarily uncommon; ICE typically prioritized immigrants with felonies for deportation.
Orozco Forero had seen the reports of undocumented immigrants being rounded up at their immigration appointments. President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort has led to the detention of about 30,000 migrants with no criminal record, like Orozco Forero, who now make up about half of those detained. Her husband does have a misdemeanor reckless driving conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol on his record, but he completed a court-mandated alcohol course for that and has no other convictions.
Still, Orozco Forero wasn’t worried when she headed to her appointment on the morning of June 18. If ICE planned to detain her, Orozco Forero thought, they would have asked her to come with the boys, right?
And she had been doing everything right: She’d gone to all her appointments, taken documentation to show she was going to school at Green River Community College taking courses in English and early childhood education. She had completed a child care internship that trained her to open her own licensed in-home day care. Her licensure approval was set to arrive any moment, likely that same week, and the day care was just about ready to go.
But that morning, her family was still wary, asking her to share her location just in case.
Shortly after 10 a.m., Orozco Forero texted her family member: “They are going to deport us”
“Nicolle what happened? Nicolle answer me,” they texted back. “What do I do?”
“I can’t speak I feel like I’m going to faint,” Orozco Forero replied. And then: “I’m sorry it wasn’t what we expected.”

Two-and-a-half hours west, on the coast of Washington in a town called Southbend, Wishon was frantic. Orozco Forero had texted her, too. ICE was asking for the boys.
In two years, Wishon had grown incredibly close to Orozco Forero, who had cared for her own kids. After her family moved to the coast, Wishon rented out her house in Seattle to Orozco Forero, whose boys were excited to have a home with a yard.
Wishon’s husband, Gabriel, hopped into his truck and headed to Seattle. Wishon, meanwhile, got on the phone with the Orozco Forero family’s ICE agent and every lawyer she could. They were going to take them into detention at a facility 2,200 miles away in Texas, a facility that was reopened earlier this year by the Trump administration to detain families. Wishon wanted to find a lawyer who could stop the deportation order, and she wanted to make sure the boys would be reunited with their parents if they took them to meet the ICE agent.

And that was especially important, not just because they were young children, but because Juan David is still sick.
For the past year, he’s been seeking treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital for an illness that is turning his urine muddy. So far, doctors have determined he’s losing red blood cells and protein through his urine, indicating a possible kidney issue, but they haven’t yet zeroed in on what is causing the problem. They likely need a kidney biopsy to be sure.
“Given the complexity of his case, it is essential that Juan remain in the United States for continued testing and treatment,” his nephrologist Jordan Symons wrote in a March letter to ICE. “We kindly request that you consider this medical necessity in your review of his immigration status and grant him the ability to stay in the United States until his treatment and evaluation are completed.”
Juan David’s care team has been monitoring him closely to ensure his red blood cell and protein levels never drop too low. His condition could become serious quickly.
“You can die from that,” said Sarah Kasnick, a physician’s assistant who is familiar with his case. Kasnick is also a foster parent, and Orozco Forero provided care for her family.
When Gabriel Wishon arrived to pick up the boys, they were confused and disoriented. Where were their parents? Why was everyone crying? They didn’t want to go to Colombia, they told him on the drive. They wanted to stay in the United States.
Around 5:30 p.m. that evening, he met with the ICE agent, who had waited past her work hours for them to arrive.
“Bye boys, you are going to see your parents right now. They are right inside,” Wishon told them. He watched them walk in carrying two stuffed animals, a Super Mario doll and Chase, the popular cartoon dog dressed as a police officer.

The families Orozco Forero cares for are now in a free fall.
Jessica Cocson, whose son has been in Orozco Forero’s care for more than a year, described her in a character letter to ICE as a “blessing to us in ways I struggle to fully express.”
Orozco Forero and her husband “support working families, provide quality childcare, and demonstrate compassion and commitment every day,” Cocson wrote. “It is heartbreaking to think that someone who gives so much and asks so little could be forced to leave.”
Tamia Riley, whose two sons with autism were also in Orozco Forero’s care, said losing her was like watching “a father walking out the door.”
“These people, these day care providers, sitters, they are a form of family members for me and my children,” Riley said.
Now, the day care she was set to open lays empty. Inside, the walls are plastered with posters listing colors and sight words. There are cushioned mats on the floor and play stations. Tables with tiny chairs. A tall pink dollhouse. High chairs and a pack and play for the babies. Outside, two play houses, a ball pit, toys to ride on and little picnic tables set across an artificial turf. But no children to enjoy any of it.
Orozco Forero’s detention has rattled child care workers across the country. In Texas, workers represented by the Service Employees International Union have been rallying in her name. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, spoke in support of the family’s release at a rally on June 29 in San Antonio. And a group of union workers is attempting to deliver supplies to the family. It’s an effort Orozco Forero knows little about; she only has limited communication with those on the outside.
Tricia Schroeder, the president of the Seattle-based SEIU chapter that represents care workers, said that, for years unions like hers have been working to improve quality, access and affordability in child care, a system in such deep crisis it’s been called by the Treasury Department “a textbook example of a broken market.”
Immigrant women like Orozco Forero were part of that effort to improve access, doing jobs few Americans want to take on.
“Detaining child care providers, especially those who care for kids with special needs, just deepens the crisis in early learning,” Schroeder said.

Orozco Forero was also the connective tissue that kept families employed. Her loss has rippled across industries.
Kasnick, the foster parent, said one of the children in her care had been tentatively set to start at Orozco Forero’s day care as soon as it opened. Orozco Forero had been the only provider who would take the child, who has autism and is nonverbal.
Orozco Forero had cared for the girl at Wishon’s day care as if she was her own, even taking her in once when the child’s care had fallen through and no foster family in the entire county would take her in because of the complexity of her needs. The girl arrived at Orozco Forero’s house at midnight on a weekend “with no clothing, toys, medication or any of her belongings … this did not [deter] Nicolle and Sebastian instead they immediately went and purchased all the things” the child needed, a social worker wrote in a letter to ICE. Kasnick said Orozco Forero was even considering becoming a foster parent.
Without her, Kasnick is out of options: She quit her job as a physician’s assistant to care for the child after Orozco Forero was detained.
“There are now 44 patients a day who don’t have anyone to provide their health care, and I can’t go to work because Nicolle’s day care didn’t open,” Kasnick said.
In the weeks since, Kasnick has had an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, she said. How could this happen to someone who gave back so much?
“The security of knowing that you can be in your home one day and in a prison the next week, and you didn’t do anything except exist?” she said. “It makes you feel like there’s no good left in the world.”

Orozco Forero’s family was in ICE detention for nearly a month awaiting a bond hearing they hoped could buy them time in the United States. Orozco Forero and the boys were together; her husband was in the same facility but separated from them.
Juan David wasn’t eating much. It took three weeks for him to receive medical care, Orozco Forero told her attorney, James Costo.
Costo had been working to get the details of why ICE allowed the family to stay in the country with monitoring after they lost their asylum case last year. There has been an order for their deportation since then, but ICE never attempted to deport them until the Trump administration ramped up efforts. The number of immigrants without criminal convictions who have been detained has doubled since May.
The process to fight an asylum claim and appeal a denial is complicated — there are court deadlines, documents that need to be submitted and translated.
“They think maybe they can do it themselves and go in and say what happened but they are not understanding the whole legal process,” Costo said. “The system isn’t made for things to be easy.”
Costo was hopeful a judge will allow them to stay in the country temporarily as Juan David seeks care. They have almost no family left in Colombia, and no way to obtain care for him there, their family said.
But on Thursday, Wishon got word that the family had been deported. The family arrived distraught at the home of the only close family they have in Bogotá, the capital.
Daniel, Orozco Forero’s youngest son, sent Wishon a voice message: “Good evening Stephanie, um, we are good. My mommy is very sad,” his little voice tells her.”Thank you for everything you have done for us. God bless you.”
A GoFundMe she set up will be used toward supporting the family as they try to transition to life in Colombia and seek care for Juan David.

A collection of support letters they hoped would move a judge somewhere to hear their case now only remain as chronicles of their impact. In the letters, Juan David’s first grade teachers call him an exceptional student who went from one of the lowest reading levels in the class — 10 words a minute — to one of the highest at 70 words a minute.
“He shows the qualities of a model citizen at a young age — dependable, ethical, and hard-working,” wrote his teacher, Carla Trujillo.
They were all on their way to shaping a better life, Wishon wrote in hers. The couple “worked tirelessly to build a better life for their children and to open their own licensed child care business. In all my years of employing and mentoring caregivers, I have rarely met a couple as responsible, driven, and capable as Nicolle and Sebastian.”
“This family is not a threat,” she concluded. “They are an asset.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-11-094001-1024x675.png,,,2025-07-11 17:16:24.457213

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


PEORIA – With major future cuts to social service programs now written into law, Democrats seeking Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat in 2026 are hitting the campaign trail seeking to position themselves among the law’s most vocal opponents.

“We want Illinoisians throughout our state to understand the ripple effects of the Trump administration’s cruelty and be prepared for what’s to come,” Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said during a panel discussion at the Greater Chicago Food Depository Thursday.

The federal policy bill, dubbed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” signed by President Donald Trump on July 4 will slash federal spending for health care and other human service programs over the next several years, in many cases leaving states to pick up the tab if they are to continue providing benefits. The bill is expected to cost Illinois more than $700 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, cut Medicaid spending in Illinois by $48 billion over the next 10 years, and potentially force some rural hospitals to close.

As Illinois’ 2026 candidates prepare to begin circulating nominating petitions next month, the three Democrats vying for retiring Sen. Dick Durbin’s Senate seat met with residents around the state to hear about the local impacts of the bill and rally support for their campaigns.

Stratton held an official state event in Chicago to discuss the Pritzker administration’s response to SNAP changes, while U.S. Reps. Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi visited downstate communities to discuss the bill.

Kelly gets feedback in Peoria

Kelly, who represents the state’s 2nd Congressional District across parts of Chicago, the south suburbs and rural eastern Illinois, visited with voters in Peoria to hear their concerns about the bill.

The Bradly University graduate said her goal is to make sure Americans are aware of the bill’s effects – even though many of them are slated to begin after the 2026 midterm election.

“In polling and different things that we’ve done, half of the population doesn’t even realize what’s going on,” Kelly said.

Kelly played up her relationship with U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, saying she has been part of a coalition of House Democrats that have been traveling the country holding town hall meetings about federal spending cuts.

“Every group that we can speak in front of, we need to speak in front of,” Kelly said. “And so that’s one of the reason’s we’re traveling.”

Krishnamoorthi visits rural pharmacy 

Krishnamoorthi, who represents the 8th Congressional District in the northwest suburbs, visited a pharmacy in Petersburg about 30 minutes northwest of Springfield.

He echoed concerns other Illinois Democrats have expressed about the “large, lousy law” cutting Medicaid and that it could limit health care services in rural communities.

“When you have that many people who all of a sudden don't have a way of paying for their health care, then it hurts all those rural health care providers that depend on Medicaid as a form of payment for so many of their patients,” Krishnamoorthi said.

Krishnamoorthi also worried about domino effects from growing deficits as a result of the bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will increase by more than $3 trillion. According to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF, the growing deficit could trigger automatic spending cuts, which could force Medicare cuts even though it was not reduced in the bill.

“We're also talking about seniors who could be affected by Medicare cuts,” Krishnamoorthi said. “And so at the end of the day, however, everybody's going to be affected because if, God forbid, one of these hospitals in these areas in the rural parts of Illinois are closed, then everyone, regardless of how their health care is paid for, would be affected negatively.”

SNAP cuts worry candidates

Stratton did not hit the campaign trail with any public events this week, but the Pritzker administration must now decide how it will proceed with new spending requirements signed by the president and the effects of fewer residents receiving social service benefits.

Stratton and other top Pritzker administration officials discussed the impact of cuts to the SNAP program during a panel discussion at the Greater Chicago Food Depository as the state seeks more immediate solutions that lawmakers could approve before the 2026 election. The lieutenant governor, who resides on Chicago’s South Side, said reducing eligibility for a food program exacerbates other issues such as crime, economic productivity and learning in schools.

“Hunger is not a problem that stays isolated,” Stratton said. “The repercussions seep out, harming everyone and everything in its path until something changes.”

Kelly told voters in Peoria that SNAP cuts aren’t just a problem for low-income recipients.

“If you cannot buy food, then you’re not shopping at Kroger or wherever you shop,” Kelly said. “And so then Kroger is not buying as much food from the farmers and then they won’t need as many people to work there.”

The Republican field in the Senate race has yet to take shape. Republican Rep. Darin LaHood from the Peoria area held a virtual townhall with 16th Congressional District voters to discuss why he believes the bill will benefit Illinois.

Obtaining a designation from the global group DarkSky International is no easy task, according to state tourism officials. It was a rigorous, yearslong process that, for Bluff, involved not just the adoption of an exterior lighting ordinance years ago to require homes and businesses use night-sky-friendly lighting, but also volunteer sky brightness monitors and community stargazing events. 
“We’re so proud to receive this designation,” Bluff Mayor Ann Leppanen said in a prepared statement included in a news release issued by DarkSky International, a global nonprofit devoted to reducing light pollution and protecting natural night skies. 
The mayor added that designating Bluff — home to a population of about 300 people — was “one of the first things our community wanted to do” after they voted to incorporate Bluff as a town in 2018. 
“The dark skies over Bluff are more than beautiful — they’re part of who we are,” Leppanen said. “Earning this designation reflects years of dedication from our residents and a deep respect for the natural world.”

To achieve the designation, the Bears Ears Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the natural and cultural landscapes of Bears Ears National Monument, agreed to provide at least two dark-sky educational programs per year, as well as conduct sky quality monitoring on a seasonal basis. 
“Since 2016, community-led star parties have helped inspire reverence and respect for the night sky,” DarkSky International said in its announcement. “In 2024, the Town of Bluff solidified a formal partnership with Bears Ears Partnership (BEP) that helped push the town over the finish line. BEP now leads ongoing education and seasonal sky monitoring, ensuring Bluff meets DarkSky’s requirements for years to come.”
Bluff was officially awarded the designation on June 24. DarkSky International described it as a “prestigious certification” that “recognizes the dedicated efforts of Bears Ears Partnership, Town of Bluff, and community advocates committed to protecting the natural night environment.” 
“Bluff now joins a select group of communities around the world working to preserve the natural night environment,” the DarkSky International announcement said. “This achievement reflects Bluff’s deep respect for the land, its wildlife, and its people — now and for generations to come.”
Bluff is now one of 57 certified dark sky communities, according to DarkSky’s website. It joins five other Utah communities on that list, including Springdale near Zion National Park, Torrey near Capitol Reef National Park, Moab and Castle Valley near Arches National Park, and Helper in Carbon County.

Utah, with its five national parks and 46 state parks, is also home to dozens of other dark sky designation types, including 27 accredited international dark sky places and 18 dark sky parks. Timpanogous Cave National Monument has been designated one of 13 urban night sky places, and Rainbow Bridge National Monument is one of 23 certified dark sky sanctuaries. 
The perks of a dark sky designation? The certification raises awareness of light pollution while helping agencies achieve “long-term conservation targets and connecting people to nature, according to DarkSky International’s website. The bragging rights also help serve “as an economic driver by fostering tourism and local economic activity.” 
The Utah Office of Tourism celebrated Bluff’s designation in a news release issued Thursday. 
“Preserving the night sky is vital not only to Utah’s long-lasting tourism economy but also to creating opportunities for generational economic prosperity and a dynamic visitor experience,” Natalie Randall, managing director of the Utah Office of Tourism and Film, said in a prepared statement. “We are thrilled to celebrate and support the town of Bluff’s achievement. I am proud of the incredible leadership and dedication the community has shown in preserving their night sky.”
Bluff resident Sarah Burak, who is also education director with Bears Ears Partnership, was involved in the effort to achieve the dark sky designation.
“As we’re rapidly losing natural darkness worldwide, it is important to do what we can to protect this irreplaceable resource at home and set an example for other gateway communities to public lands,” Burak said. “I am encouraged and grateful to be part of a community working to preserve the night sky for ourselves and future generations.” 
To celebrate Bluff’s designation, the town — in partnership with groups including Business Owners of Bluff, Bears Ears Partnership and the Bluff Community Foundation — will be holding a Dark Sky Festival this fall, on Nov. 14-15.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-11 20:00:51+00:00,CT Mirror,CT kids’ crisis care centers face funding problems,Ginny Monk and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/11/ct-urgent-crisis-centers-funding-problems/,"CT's urgent and mobile crisis centers, which help children in mental health crises, are running low on funds, service providers say.","Some of the programs that help Connecticut children in mental health crises are in jeopardy due to a lack of funding and problems accessing Medicaid funds, service providers say.
Urgent crisis centers, which are operated by private agencies and funded by the state, aim to quickly treat children who are often at risk of hurting themselves or others. But they are struggling to access much of their funding because the majority is allocated in the state budget through Medicaid. Yet only about half of the patients have Medicaid. 
The mobile crisis centers, which bring similar services to kids’ homes, didn’t get any funding in the first fiscal year of the recently passed biennial budget.
State officials plan to hold meetings with mental health service providers in the coming days to find solutions to the funding issues. They hope to use unspent money, such as American Rescue Plan Act dollars, to keep the mobile crisis centers afloat for the year, but it’s less clear what the solution is for the urgent crisis centers.
“We’re kind of at a loss, and we do think that Medicaid and [Department of Social Services] commissioners definitely expressed support for trying to … iron out some things. But it’s unclear how long that will take,” said Gary Steck, chief executive officer at Wellmore Behavioral Health in Waterbury. The nonprofit operates one of the state’s four urgent crisis centers and a mobile crisis program.
The urgent crisis centers received about $3 million in grant funding over the two fiscal years, and just under $8 million annually under Medicaid. But about half of the clients the centers see aren’t covered under Medicaid, meaning the centers can’t access much of that money. Many privately insured patients have high-deductible health care plans and can’t pay fees.
The mobile crisis program got about $8.6 million in fiscal year 2027, but nothing in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1.
On Friday, Senate Republicans sent a letter to DSS Commissioner Andrea Barton-Reeves, asking her to provide an update because “the state’s urgent crisis centers are concerned about future funding now that money provided through the American Rescue Plan Act is starting to run out.”
The questions about funding come as providers say more children continue to struggle with severe mental health problems. Last summer, youth suicides spiked. Providers believe that the crisis care programs are among the best ways to help suicidal kids.
The urgent crisis centers were established through 2022 legislation and opened in 2023. They aimed to prevent children with mental health needs from having to go to the emergency room. Since they opened, they’ve served thousands of children and more than 95% have been able to go home safely after their visit.
Steck called the program “a miracle.”
“Since their inception, the [urgent crisis centers], in a little over two years, have served over 2,000 families. And of those, 97% of those families were able to go home safely and did not need to go into the emergency room,” said Hector Glynn, chief executive officer at the Village for Families & Children, which runs the Hartford-based crisis center. “That is a phenomenal success rate. It’s a success rate we don’t see in most other services that we provide.”
About half of the children who visit the centers have Medicaid insurance, which typically has higher reimbursement rates than private insurance for mental health care. Many of the privately insured families also have high deductible plans, and when they can’t pay, the nonprofits write off the debt.
“The last thing we want to do is have finances become such a barrier to care that families wind up saying, ‘You know what, we’re just going to try to limp along and hope for the best or wait and ultimately go to the emergency department, because we’re not sure how we would ever manage to pay this bill,’” said Lisa Otto, chief executive officer of the Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut.
Otto said her nonprofit has funds to run their urgent crisis center in New London until February before they run into issues. Because the model is unique for Connecticut because it’s emergency care focused on behavioral health, there isn’t a blueprint for billing, she said.
Steck said his center in Waterbury will have acute funding needs in the fall. They have run out of money more quickly because they have operated with longer hours than the other centers.
In addition to the issues with fewer clients having Medicaid, it’s hard to find billing codes that work for both the state government and the federal government.
The Department of Social Services plans to meet with providers later this month to talk about solutions, said Medicaid director William Halsey. There may be options to “bundle” billing to make it easier for providers to get paid for more services. 
That means they’d be able to bill for a slew of services typically provided during urgent crisis visits rather than billing for individual services, Halsey said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, said lawmakers are also looking into policy changes that might help ease the financial burden. She hopes they can address it in a special session this fall, she said.
“We’re also talking with insurance and looking at how the insurance can be covered that might require re-coding,” said Maher, who is also a member of the Transforming Children’s Behavioral Health Policy and Planning Committee. “It’s an ongoing conversation, so we’re very aware of making sure that they are funded.”
Children’s Committee and ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said in a statement that the House Republican’s budget would have better offered funding for crisis care.
“There should be no surprises regarding the partisan biennium budget’s lack of funding for mobile crisis centers in the first fiscal year. The decision to allocate funding elsewhere comes despite the ongoing discussions about mental health challenges that often arise during our legislative sessions,” said Dauphinais, who is also a member of the behavioral health committee.
The urgent crisis centers work with mobile crisis units to make sure kids who have immediate mental health needs get help. The crisis units often serve more rural areas of Connecticut that are further from the urgent crisis centers in New Haven, New London, Waterbury and Hartford.
Steck said the mobile crisis centers are at more of an immediate risk if they don’t get more money in this fiscal year.
“The programs can continue because they had some state dollars,” Steck said. “But each of the sites is in jeopardy if they don’t come up with these resources.” 
The mobile crisis centers also operate 24/7, which was initially paid for with federal COVID relief money through the end of calendar year 2026, said Office of Policy and Management Senior Policy Advisor Claudio Gualtieri during a public meeting last month.
Gualtieri said the state Department of Children and Families is looking for unspent COVID relief money to carry the centers through the year and will “braid any other additional funding that may be needed,” to get them to 2027 when the funding is in the state budget.
“I do think there’s a path forward,” Gualtieri said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/370561458_1022485095833969_7776813528403543671_n-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 16:14:59.368921

The Health Department said that it and the train’s owner, CN Railroad, collected and tested samples of Glendora’s water supply. The department used its own public health laboratory, and CN used a third-party, certified lab.
“The results of those analyses confirm no benzene impacts to the Glendora public water supply,” the Health Department said.
However, the department said it will increase how often it monitors for benzene in Glendora’s water, checking once a year rather than once every six years. 
“If no detectable results for benzene are shown for three consecutive years, the sampling frequency will return to the regulatory standard of every six years,” the department said.
One of the train cars that derailed Saturday contained benzene, a hazardous chemical compound used in products including detergents and plastics. Symptoms of benzene poisoning include drowsiness, fast or irregular heartbeat, tremors and headaches. Glendora residents had to evacuate temporarily as fire trucks put out the blaze and responded to the crash. 
Mayor Johnny B. Thomas spoke to Mississippi Today and criticized officials’ response to the derailment. Two village residents said that they and their children had headaches, stomach aches, drowsiness and other symptoms. 
The state Health Department said that it, the state Department of Environmental Quality, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, CN Railroad and the National Transportation Safety Board are still monitoring the derailment site.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09152821/Sun-Sentinel-photo-of-train-derailment.webp,,,2025-07-11 16:14:59.368921

In Jackson on Wednesday, the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council met for the first time to discuss how Mississippi should go about distributing hundreds of millions of settlement dollars, money paid out by pharmaceutical companies for their roles in catalyzing hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths. 
Before the meeting started, council chair and Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch provided the 15 voting members and 22 nonvoting participants draft documents of how the committee could operate. The proposals included rules the advisory committee should follow, information to provide groups looking to apply for settlement dollars the state is dedicating to address addiction and an application for making that request.

Council members raised concerns about Fitch’s documents. Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Randolph, one of the voting council members, said he worried the materials were missing important information and could lead to the state not addressing the public health catastrophe at hand. 
Randolph joined over a video call, and he told Mississippi Today after the meeting that severe technical difficulties made it hard for him to hear what was happening in Jackson. 
But he affirmed that his biggest priorities for the council are helping Mississippi families who’ve suffered most from the addiction crisis and ensuring this public money isn’t spent on expenses unrelated to the public health crisis at hand, as Mississippi had done with its tobacco settlement funds and federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Family dollars.
 He said he didn’t think the documents as proposed would address the opioid crisis.
“We have to make sure we do not make the mistakes of the past,” Randolph told the other council members. “We have to make sure we don’t end up with no accountability.”
While some local governments have started spending their settlement dollars, the state government, which is  responsible for a share of Mississippi opioid settlements that could total around $360 million, has yet to start using its dollars to address and prevent addiction. Every state that borders Mississippi has started distributing the largest portion of their opioid dollars, some over a year ago. 
In 2021, Fitch’s office developed a plan to send 70% of Mississippi’s total opioid settlement dollars – which could now be around $300 million – to the University of Mississippi Medical Center for a proposed addiction treatment center. But the plan was never realized, and the Legislature passed its bill this year to create an advisory council tasked with making recommendations on how lawmakers should spend the funds. 
The law mandates the council solicits, reviews and makes recommendations on applications for opioid abatement projects by Dec. 1 of each year.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Jason White did not respond to emailed questions asking why the lawmakers waited years to initiate their plan for distributing the state’s opioid settlements and why they created a rapid timeline for the attorney general’s office to develop a grant application, publish the form and review grants. 
At the advisory meeting, one of Fitch’s special assistants, Caleb Pracht, told the council members that they are overseeing $73.3 million of the state’s approximately $85 million of opioid settlement funds received so far. Fitch and state lawmakers have allowed for the remaining millions of dollars to be spent on non-addiction purposes. 
The original goal, according to Pracht, was to launch the application in mid-July and have interested groups apply for the grant by Aug. 29. 
But that timeline was pushed back shortly after Randolph and other members pointed out missing information in the attorney general’s material. Joseph Sclafani, a voting adviser and Gov. Tate Reeves’ attorney, expressed concern that while the proposed rules said all qualified applications must be reviewed, the document never defined who meets the qualification.

From the draft material, it was unclear whether individuals, nonprofit organizations, for-profit companies or local government agencies could apply for these funds. 
“I don’t think we should be determining on the fly what is qualified and what isn’t,” Sclafani told Pracht. “I think we should have a standard for what is a qualified applicant before we start looking.” 
The information for grant applicants defined eligible projects but only said they were those that address substance use disorder or other harmful effects of the opioid epidemic. Later in the meeting, Scalfani told the other advisers there should be a system to evaluate applications, and it should be made available to applicants. 
“I’ve never seen a grant you apply for that you don’t know the scoring rubric at the time you apply,” he said. 
By the end of the meeting, Pracht said both the launch of the settlement grant application and the deadline for applying would have to be delayed a few weeks. The council members agreed to meet again before publishing the application, this time entirely over video conference.
Michelle Williams, Fitch’s chief of staff, told the committee that it’s important for the council to evaluate all the applications by the end of November to meet the Legislature’s December deadline. 
After the meeting, Williams told Mississippi Today that while the council’s suggestions added more tasks for Fitch on a tight timeline, Fitch’s office would work to make sure the application publication and deadline wouldn’t be delayed more than a couple weeks. 
“We’re going to turn around as much as we can right now,” she said. “… Get them to do another meeting where they can discuss it, agree to something, and then we’ll push that out right away.”
Randolph told Mississippi Today that he thinks the council, the Legislature and Fitch want these dollars to be spent appropriately. If he and the other members need additional time with the application, he said, they’ll ask the Legislature for it. 
But he said as one member of the council, he will continue to vote against any part of the process that doesn’t ensure Mississippians who’ve suffered the most from the overdose epidemic benefit from the settlement dollars. To do that, the application process needs to be clear.
“I didn’t see that,” he said. “And I’m sure they’re working on that, but I don’t got that all. I’m not ready to sign off on anything until I’m satisfied.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09155631/3X0A7475.jpg,,,2025-07-11 16:14:59.368921

James Beach, chair of the Camden County Democratic Committee, is suing three progressive Democrats who won seats on the Cherry Hill Democratic Committee in June, saying they should not be able to fill the committee’s 71 vacancies. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A Superior Court judge on Friday barred a trio of progressives elected to Cherry Hill’s Democratic municipal committee from filling any of the committee’s 71 vacancies with anyone other than their one-time opponents.
Judge Michael Kassel’s ruling, upon which he put a 45-day stay to allow the progressives a chance to appeal, would shift majority membership in the party body from the three members who carried the committee election in June by nearly 25 points to a supermajority of candidates who prevailed in only three of the township’s 48 voting districts.
“This is an impressive victory,” Kassel said from the bench during roughly three hours of oral arguments Friday, later adding, “the size of the victory is legally irrelevant.”
Kassell also ordered the three from reorganizing or amending committee bylaws.
Attorney Yael Bromberg, who represented progressives Susan Druckenbrod, Rena Margulis, and David Stahl, said they would lodge an emergency appeal of the judge’s ruling.
The June 10 race for Cherry Hill’s Democratic county committee seats was atypical.
The three progressive candidates competed against 74 candidates backed by the powerful Camden County Democratic Committee. Ballots for the contest did not include individual ovals, and instead split them into two groups with a single oval for each.
Before the primary, the three progressive county committee members sued Camden County Clerk Pamela Lampitt over the ballot’s design, alleging it violated a provision of the state’s new ballot design statute that requires ovals or other spaces for voters to mark their vote appear “to the left or to the right of the name of each candidate.”
An official within the clerk’s office in April said the sheer number of county committee candidates barred individual ovals, and progressives eventually dropped their suit because of the nearness of the state’s June 10 primaries and the urgency of ballot printing deadlines.
The ballot design appeared to turn a race from a vote-for-74 contest to a vote-for-one, and progressives’ victory appeared to put them in full control of the committee. Sen. James Beach (D-Camden), chair of the Camden County Democratic Committee, sued to prevent the progressives from filling the 71 vacancies on Cherry Hill’s committee.
Bill Tambussi, who represents Beach and the Camden County Democratic Committee, argued on Friday that the low number of progressive candidates limited the possible scope of their victory.
“They only ran three candidates. That was their choice,” Tambussi said.
Failing to fill the remaining 71 seats with candidates who were on the ballot would disenfranchise voters, he added.
The judge said the result left a 74-way tie for fourth place.
Bromberg argued that filling the committee’s vacancies with candidates backed by the Camden County Democratic Committee would be the greater disenfranchisement given the scale and breadth of progressives’ victory.
“It’s not only three,” Bromberg said. “It’s the 90% of districts that elected them.”
With just three sitting members, the municipal committee could not call a quorum or fill seats, Tambussi argued, citing bylaws that require 30% of the committee’s full membership to call a quorum and state statute that requires “a majority of the persons able to vote” be present at any meetings to fill vacancies.
The anti-machine committee members could meet both bars, Bromberg argued, because they encompassed the committee’s full membership, regardless of how many seats it had.
“Those are the rules of the game, and just because you don’t like the outcome doesn’t make those rules unfair,” she said.
The judge agreed that is true “as a matter of statistics” but said he believes that interpretation goes against the spirit of the law.
Bromberg argued a portion of the state’s election law cited by Camden Democrats and governing vacancies among candidates “nominated” at primaries is wholly inapplicable to candidates for county committee because those candidates are elected — not nominated — at primaries and are not voted on in general elections.
Attorney General Matt Platkin has moved to intervene in the case, siding with progressives, but the court is not set to hear that motion until early Aug. 1. It’s not clear how progressives’ appeal might affect that timeline.
It’s also unclear how the committee’s three members are to select 71 of the 74 runners up or what challenges the three candidates who don’t get a seat could lodge. New Jersey has no election tie-breaking mechanism. Historically, judges have ordered re-do elections in such cases, sometimes years after the fact.

(Courtesy photo and photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A feud between American-born delivery drivers for Walmart’s grocery service and Spanish-speaking “deliveristas” may have led to recent federal immigration arrests in the Albuquerque area — including one that drew national attention this week, Source New Mexico has learned. 
On Monday, a Walmart customer captured video of federal immigration enforcement agents cornering a man inside a Walmart at Coors and Interstate 40. In the video, he screams for help as three agents, two of whom are masked, subdue him with a Taser. He falls to the ground and appears to hit his head.

Watch the video here. Warning: The video contains violent content.  

While the federal agents stand over him, a Walmart official enters the video frame shouting at one person to “get back to work” and approaches the person filming. He orders her to leave the store, saying she’s on “private property.” The 20-second video ends as private security officers begin to escort the woman out of the store. 
The woman who filmed the arrest, who goes by Vero Veronica on Facebook, posted the video a little after 11 a.m. on Monday, July 7. It’s since amassed millions of online views, along with   comments expressing shock at the violent nature of an unarmed man’s arrest and curiosity about what role, if any, Walmart played in an operation that occurred in its store. 
In interviews Thursday with Source NM, family and friends identified the man in the video as Deivi Jose Molina-Pena, a 33-year-old whom they said arrived in the United States legally under Temporary Protected Status about two years ago from Venezuela. 
ICE arrested an Albuquerque man. He ended up in the hospital. Now no one knows where he is.

With the help of a Spanish interpreter, family and friends said they have not heard from Molina-Pena apart from a brief phone call Monday evening to his roommate, Jean Carlos Useche, during which he seemed to be “in shock”; described severe pain in his head; and asked Useche to take care of his belongings and other small-seeming logistical things. 
Useche’s eyes welled with tears as he expressed his fear that his friend was concussed or had other untreated head injuries, and that he’d face retribution from the military if the U.S. deports him to Venezuela. 
“He hit his head when he fell. He has something in his head that doesn’t go away right away,” Useche said. ICE “needs to conduct an in-depth study there.”
Molina-Pena and his friends and family who spoke to Source on Thursday all come from Venezuela and are seeking asylum here while working as delivery drivers, including for Spark, Walmart’s grocery delivery service. 
Molina-Pena met Useche and their fellow roommate Jose Vergel while driving for the app. His cousin, Daisy Diaz, worked as a Spark driver until becoming pregnant about six months ago, she said. Her husband, Segundo Torres, supports his growing family driving for the service now, he said.
The group describes app-based work like being a Spark driver as a flexible way to earn a living, and one that also helps them maximize wages by simply working for as many apps at a time as possible.
But since President Donald Trump took office in January, the group told Source New Mexico, being a “deliverista” has become increasingly dangerous, with long-simmering resentment coming from American-born Spark drivers who accuse them of stealing their turf and gaming the system. 
“The thing is that after the new president took office, racism increased,” Torres said. “Racist people — they already have it in for you.”
Calling ICE on  ‘deliveristas’
Source spoke with one Albuquerque Spark driver who confirmed the internal tension among employees may have led to the ICE incident.
A driver named Zack told Source on Wednesday that he and fellow American-born Spark drivers have repeatedly called an Immigration and Customs Enforcement hotline to tip off the agency about where the “deliveristas” gather and how to find them. 
Zack declined to provide his last name out of fear, he said, from reprisal from “gangs” like Tren de Aragua he alleges conscript Latino delivery drivers in Albuquerque and elsewhere. (Torres and the others adamantly denied being in gangs: “It’s all political propaganda,” he said.)
Source received a call from Zack after soliciting Spark driver interviews in a private Facebook group. Source included his statements in this story because they provide the best glimpse available into why ICE may have targeted Albuquerque “deliveristas.”

“Drivers are taking matters into their own hands. I know I sat on the hotline for over an hour and a half,” Zack said of calling ICE recently. “But I couldn’t get through.”
Other drivers made calls to the hotline about “deliveristas” whom he knows often gather at the north end of the parking lot of a Rio Rancho Walmart parking lot, he said. 
On June 5, a team of federal law enforcement agents swept the Rio Rancho Walmart, detaining as many as a dozen “deliveristas” from Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia and elsewhere, according to delivery drivers who either witnessed the arrests or personally knew people detained. Brian Nobes, a supervisor at First Convenient Bank inside the store, worked the day the arrests occurred and told Source he personally knew several of the drivers, whom he said disappeared from the store the day after the arrests.
Witnesses and others estimate agents arrested as many as 12 people during the Rio Rancho sweep. At least three of them remain in jail, according to fellow “deliveristas,” though none has been confirmed to be deported yet, they said.  
ICE officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Source this week about the Rio Rancho parking lot sweep or the viral arrest inside the Albuquerque store, including questions about whether calls to its hotline resulted in ICE targeting the “deliveristas.” An unnamed ICE spokesperson told KRQE on Thursday that Molina-Pena “posed an immediate threat to the safety of agents, shoppers, and employees.”
However, Zack’s description of whom agents targeted during the raid, which has not been previously publicized, tracks with eyewitness accounts and statements from local law enforcement. 
For example, Lt. John Castañeda with the Sandoval County Sheriff’s Office told Source that his office served a “support” role in the arrests at the Rio Rancho Wal-mart, and while he did not know who was targeted or how many were arrested, he described the operation as focused solely on its parking lot.

‘Green light’ for hatred
The tension between Albuquerque Spark drivers echoes a national trend in various industries, one intensified with Trump’s election and rhetoric. 
“The messaging coming from the White House is that anybody who is targeting undocumented individuals, whether they are government officials or not, are heroes and should be praised,” said Lauryn Pfrommer-Pease, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center. 
She’s seen the ICE hotline wielded against her center’s clients by former partners, ex-coworkers or random community members. It’s become a powerful tool for non-immigrants to wield against those they suspect of being foreign-born, she said, over personal disputes or for strategic advantage.
The dispute here between Spark drivers “feels pretty representative of the hostile energy in the country right now,” she said. “I think that the administration has put a green light in place for individual, person on person, attacks and hatred.”
Torres said a man in a Walmart parking lot two weeks ago photographed license plates of Latino drivers. Vergel said he and fellow “deliveristas” were eating lunch in his car recently when a woman reached her hand into the open window and flipped everyone off.
Last April, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and other Republican senators introduced legislation calling on major delivery apps like Grubhub and DoorDash to answer for a New York Post article that quoted a single Uber delivery driver who warned that newly arrived immigrants were evading background checks or falsifying their applications. As a result, immigrants driving for the apps “is a significant security issue” given that “we go inside peoples’ homes,” the Uber driver said in the article. 
A driver for four years in Albuquerque, Zack accused recent immigrants of gaming the Spark delivery system by using multiple phones and accounts to select the most lucrative deliveries; falsifying account or driver information; and loitering in Walmart parking lots so they can get the first dibs on customers orders.

As a result, he said, he had to take a second job driving for Uber at night to make ends meet, and he claims immigrants’ poor customer service has resulted in customers shopping elsewhere. 
In the days following the Rio Rancho Walmart arrests, Zack said, he and fellow “legitimate” drivers got more orders than usual, he said. The same occurred this week at the Coors location, he told Source on Thursday. 
In the interview at Las Cumbres Community Services in Albuquerque, where Diaz and Torres received some recent support as asylum seekers, they adamantly denied cheating the Spark app. 
Instead, they said they buy their cars honestly and fairly like everyone else, and undergo background and other checks before being approved to drive. Torres said “deliveristas” often use two phones, “one personal, one professional,” to dedicate hard drive space to the Spark app, advice he said he received from fellow drivers and Walmart’s technical support team.
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

As for waiting in the parking lot, Torres and others said it’s a good way to get as many orders as possible, a strategy others could employ if they chose. He said he is unaware of any Spark app rule he and other “deliveristas” might be breaking. 
Instead, he said he and his fellow “deliveristas” are just working harder than their American counterparts. He and fellow “deliveristas” typically spent most days sitting in various Walmart parking lots and stepping out to do deliveries at all times of the day and night, he said. 
“Our American dream is to sleep,” Torres said, laughing.
Just take Molina-Pena as an example of that hard work, he said.
 ‘Targeted’ at work
Like most days, Molina-Pena woke up at 3 a.m. on Monday to deliver packages for  Amazon, according to Torres and Molina-Pena’s roommates. He completed several deliveries before taking a short rest and then heading back to Walmart for his Spark gig. 
When he arrived for his second or third Walmart delivery of the day, federal agents confronted him in the Coors location parking lot, Molina-Pena’s roommates and family believe, based on a brief conversation with him Monday evening and after speaking with another driver with whom Molina-Pena was on the phone during the arrest.
Molina-Pena ran inside, believing he’d be safe inside the “private property,” but ICE agents followed him. Maria Lozoya Baca, a bank employee, told Source this week that she saw private security officers run toward the aisle where Molina-Pena was arrested. 
“He wasn’t even doing anything; he was just there,” she told Source. “It was weird to me that it was targeted, that it was just him.”
Molina-Pena’s family and friends wonder what role Walmart might have played in his arrest and all mentioned how the leaders at the Walmart that relied on his delivery work showed more concern about the video of the arrest than the arrest itself.

“We believe that sometimes it is also Walmart managers [who are to blame]” Useche said regarding ICE’s targeting of delivery drivers. “Even in the video, the manager gets in the way and says, ‘it’s private property’ and starts fighting to stop the recording.”
Walmart spokesperson Joe Pennington declined to comment on the record, including about whether Walmart knew of in advance or approved either ICE operation. 
Albuquerque police, which, unlike Sandoval County, have a policy of not collaborating with ICE, learned about the arrest from federal immigration authorities after the-fact, said spokesperson Gilbert Gallegos. He said federal officials told APD that Molina-Pena had a “violent history” and had run from police in the past, but did not provide any more information about their arrestee, including his name. The unnamed ICE agent that spoke to KRQE cited a prior DWI arrest and said Molina-Pena had tried to evade police during that incident.
Court records show Albuquerque police charged Molina-Pena in late June with driving while intoxicated and fleeing from police. He told officers who pulled him over for allegedly failing to maintain lanes a little after midnight on June 26 that he’d had only two beers, including one in the last 20 minutes, and that he fled because, in his home country, “white and red lights were not used by law enforcement personnel,” according to charging documents.
Online immigration records show Molina-Pena is being held in ICE custody in El Paso. Julia Montany, director of immigrant and refugee services, told Source and Molina-Pena’s family and friends that the American Civil Liberties Union will meet with them soon to discuss next steps and help them contact him. 
New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury’s office is also seeking a conversation with the family to intervene on Molina-Pena’s behalf, Montany said and, late Thursday, Albuquerque City Councilor Klarissa Peña issued a public statement calling on ICE to provide transparency about the arrest, “particularly in how the agency determines targets for detention.” 
She also called for clarity on the role of retailers and delivery companies in such situations, because “the community deserves to understand their policies regarding ICE activity so individuals can make informed choices when working or shopping.”
But Molina-Pena’s friends and family aren’t holding out much hope for help, they told Source. The arrest has already resulted in fewer “deliveristas” at both Walmarts that ICE hit, according to employees at both stores, and had ripples for those who knew the man whose arrest echoed across the country. 
“We are a family,” Useche said of his roommate and the other “deliveristas” in Albuquerque. “If someone is sick, someone will go find medicine, whatever it takes.”
Molina-Pena’s cousin and cousin’s husband were expecting Molina-Pena to move in with them in the coming days, but now they’re not sure how they’ll pay rent, especially with a baby on the way.
And Molina-Pena’s roommates said the arrest cemented their plan to move to Alabama where they’ll join a friend in a small town there where they say it’s safer for Latinos. 
“There’s a pretty high Latino population here, and we felt good here,” Useche said of Albuquerque. “But not now, now there’s persecution that we don’t want anymore.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)The Trump administration has agreed to not distribute devices that turn semi-automatic rifles into machine guns in Washington and other states where they are illegal.
More than a dozen states sued the administration last month over its plan to return nearly 12,000 previously confiscated devices like forced reset triggers installed on rifles that allow them to shoot up to 900 rounds per minute.
In response, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives confirmed in a court filing late last month it wouldn’t directly return the triggers to their owners in states where they’re illegal. 
“It is unfortunate that litigation was necessary when the federal government could have made these commitments much earlier,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement Friday. “But I will do everything possible to keep Washingtonians safe from dangerous machine-gun conversion devices.”
The other states bringing the litigation are California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The District of Columbia is also a plaintiff. Most of the states have laws banning forced reset triggers.
They argued the proliferation of these conversion devices in recent years has led to an increase in crimes committed with machine guns.
The Biden administration filed lawsuits against manufacturers and gun sellers and seized the devices from gun stores and individuals. The administration decided forced reset triggers were basically machine guns that are prohibited under federal law. 
But last year, a federal judge in Texas disagreed, and ordered the Biden administration to return some of the conversion devices. The administration was complying but declined to send the triggers back to states where they’re illegal. 
President Donald Trump accelerated that work, settling with manufacturers and agreeing to return the seized or surrendered devices to their owners across the country, including those convicted of felonies, the states’ lawsuit filed last month noted.
The states argued this would lead to more gun violence and force them to expend resources to confiscate the devices again. This would result in added costs for police and health care. Gun violence killed over 1,000 Washingtonians in 2023, according to federal data.
In a court filing, an ATF official wrote that there would be two notices for device owners. One will go to those in states where forced reset triggers are legal explaining how to get them returned. 
The second, for those in states like Washington where they’re illegal, will give owners three options. They could request the ATF make the transfer to them in a state where it’s legal, request transfer to a third-party in a legal state or abandon the device. If an owner does not want a device returned, the federal government would destroy it.
The triggers also won’t be returned to people prohibited from possessing firearms.
Rare Breed Triggers, a main manufacturer and seller of forced reset triggers, also committed in court papers not to sell or ship its returned products into states where they’re illegal. The company’s president estimated the ATF took custody of at least $2.5 million worth of Rare Breed products.
Because of these commitments, on Friday, the states dropped their request in Maryland federal court for a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration’s return plans.

The legal case has been going on for more than two and a half years, which is only the latest of a more than four-year controversy.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge sides with town in Tunbridge trails case.","John Echeverria speaks at the 2023 Strafford Town Meeting. File photo by Tim Calabro/White River Valley Herald
This story by Darren Marcy was first published in The White River Valley Herald on July 10.
A judge ruled Tuesday that towns in Vermont have the right to maintain their public trails on private land in the long-running lawsuit brought by a landowner against the town of Tunbridge, but the landowner in the case has promised an appeal to the state Supreme Court.
Though Superior Court Judge H. Dickson Corbett ruled against John Echeverria and Carin Pratt in the lawsuit they filed against the Town of Tunbridge, Echeverria, in an email Tuesday evening, promised a swift reply.
“We will be filing a prompt appeal to the Supreme Court,” Echeverria wrote.
The Tunbridge Selectboard got the good news at its regular meeting when a town resident announced the decision.
Board Chair Gary Mullen said the board was happy to hear the news and it was exactly what the board had expected all along.
Mullen said he wished the lawsuit and legal battle had never happened, but believed it was money well spent to protect trail access not only in Tunbridge but across Vermont.
“It was the right thing to do,” Mullen said. “It’s a win for the people of Tunbridge and the whole state. We plan to continue this battle however [Echeverria] decides to do it.”
Selectboard member Michael McPhetres praised the decision.
“I am very pleased with the court order,” McPhetres said. “We (the town of Tunbridge) have spent a lot of time and treasure on what is a common sense issue.”
The two sides have been haggling over who has the right to maintain legal trails on private land for years.
Tuesday’s 15-page order settled a few things including granting the town’s motion for summary judgment and denying the landowners’ motion for summary judgment.
In a final order issued separately, Corbett wrote, “Based upon the separate written ruling of the court, final judgment is hereby entered for defendant as follows: the Town of Tunbridge has the authority to maintain and repair its legal trails.”
But, if the decision is appealed to the Supreme Court, the case will go on for at least a little bit longer.
The case took a little bit of a back seat for a few months as the Vermont Legislature took up the issue.
A bill introduced in the Senate by Alison Clarkson, D-Woodstock, aiming to clarify that municipalities have the authority to maintain a legal trail stalled in committee, but the language was eventually added into the Transportation Bill, S.123, which had broad support from legislators and trails groups around Vermont, as well as the Vermont League of Cities and Towns.
The bill made its way through the Conference Committee process and was signed by Gov. Phil Scott in early June, despite a letter from Echeverria urging him to veto the measure.
In the Conference Committee, the bill’s effective date was delayed until April 1, 2026.
Meanwhile, the legal case has been going on for more than two and a half years, which is only the latest of a more than four-year controversy.
Echeverria and Pratt, who live in Strafford, filed a suit against Tunbridge to prevent it from conducting maintenance on the Orchard Trail, one of two legal trails that cross the 325-acre Dodge Farm, which Echeverria and Pratt own.
Twice the suit filed by the landowners was ruled by Orange County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Mann not to be “ripe,” or ready for the court to decide. But the second decision was overturned by the state Supreme Court.
Mann then recused herself and the case was assigned to Corbett.
Corbett’s ruling addresses a variety of arguments made by the landowners for reasons why the town should not be allowed to maintain the trails on their lands, but says, “the court determined that the arguments were either not persuasive or not relevant to its analysis and determinations.” 
“The court’s final observation is that real-life experience has been that Vermont towns are maintaining their trails,” he continued. “More than 150 towns have at least one trail, and there are more than 540 miles of public trails in the state. And while at least some private landowners are helping maintain public trails, many towns are maintaining their trails to keep them open for public use. In other words, widespread contemporaneous interpretation has been that towns have the authority to maintain and repair their public trails … A reading of the statutes that authorizes towns to maintain and repair their public trails would be consistent with more than a century of both legal precedent and practical experience.”

(Photo: Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)With the Florida Democratic Party looking for creative ways to break through to voters in a state that’s become a GOP stronghold, Chair Nikki Fried wants party members to consider opening their primary elections to nonparty-affiliated voters, possibly as early as next year.
Fried and her staff are collecting information to present to party members about the proposal. There is no set date when she will present that information, but she expects to act in the near future.
“That is determinative on how long this process takes and what the feedback is,” Fried said. “I certainly believe that this is the right direction, but I don’t live on an island.”
Fried is aware that “not everyone in the party is going to feel that this is the right approach.” However, she does believe that the “vast majority” of Democrats, independents, and the electorate overall “believes that this is the right direction for party politics.”
“The politics of today are very different and the political landscaping is changing,” she said.
The proposal is controversial, based on some of the responses the Phoenix has heard from Florida Democrats over the past week. While some longtime members have been espousing such a move for years, others believe it’s the last thing the party should do as it struggles to regain prominence following a surge in Republican voter registration and electoral wins over the past five years.
Fried initially spoke about the proposal in an interview with Scripps Florida State Capitol reporter Forest Saunders in May, but several state Democrats told the Phoenix they had no idea how serious the party chair was about the idea until she brought it during the party’s Leadership Blue conference last month in Hollywood.
 Concern from critics
“I am very concerned about moving to do that, opening our primaries right now, primarily because it will bring about very divisive conversations within the Democratic Party here in Florida,” said Samuel Vilchez Santiago, the Orange County Democratic Party Chair.
“Right now we need to be focused on responding and leading our community to Donald Trump’s budget, talking about the cuts he’s doing to Medicaid, impacting close to a million Floridians. The cuts to FEMA and to SNAP benefits; his mass deportation [plan]. How the Republicans have created an affordability crisis in this state after having been empowered with one-party rule for 30 years, and this is not the time to divide the party.”
Walton County Democratic Executive Committee Chair and Democratic National Committee (DNC) member Samantha Hope-Herring is adamantly opposed, calling the idea “insanity.”
“At the end of the day, people just don’t see a reason to be a Democrat, and certainly won’t if we say, ‘You know what? We’re going to let everybody vote over here so, whatever you want to do, it doesn’t matter, we’re just going to roll with it, see how it goes.’ I mean, what kind of field day is that for Republicans?” she said.
“I’m against this,” added former Hillsborough County state Rep. Sean Shaw, the party’s nominee for attorney general in 2018 and also a member of the DNC. “I know what the aim is, and I know why people think it’s a good idea, but we ought to just concentrate on winning elections as the rules are right now, rather than trying to do all of these other things that are going to have really bad unintended consequences.”
Shaw knows the issue well. As head of the nonprofit People Over Profits in 2020, his group argued against a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed open primaries, claiming it would disportionately hurt Black and brown candidates. That measure differed somewhat from what Fried is proposing because it proposed a “Top-Two” or “jungle primary,” allowing the top two finishers running for certain state and legislative seats to advance against each other in the general election, even if they were from the same political party.
Both the Democratic and Republican parties of Florida strongly opposed that at the time, but the idea resonated with voters, gaining 57% approval. While a clear majority, it failed to reach the 60% required for passage.
Terrie Rizzo was chair of the FDP leading up to that 2020 vote. She recounted this week that her opposition was truly the only thing she and then-Republican Party of Florida Chair Joe Gruters could agree about. Without elaborating, she said her stance hasn’t changed.
Although the numbers can vary depending on how you define your terms, Florida is one of only 10 states that does not open its primary elections to anyone outside their respective party members, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures (NCLS).
That’s significant because the 25% of the state’s electorate who choose to be politically independent (or nonparty-affiliated, in Florida election parlance) are banned from participating in those elections. Another 3% of state voters are registered with third-parties and are excluded from participating in Democratic and Republican primary elections. Seven states open their primary elections to unaffiliated voters, also according to the NCSL.
 System ‘isn’t working’
While the critics aren’t being shy in their opposition, other Democrats support the idea.
Democratic political strategist Steve Schale is “all for” the proposal. “It’s never a bad thing when you are trying to build a broader coalition in a state that you’ve been struggling in,” he said.
“What we’re doing now clearly isn’t working,” Schale said. “In my mind, what is the harm of trying a system where we allow independents to choose to vote in our primary? They don’t have to, but we give them that option, and it forces our candidates to talk to more voters. I’m 100% for that.”











In my mind, what is the harm of trying a system where we allow independents to choose to vote in our primary? They don’t have to, but we give them that option, and it forces our candidates to talk to more voters. I’m 100% for that.


– Steve Schale, strategist


Former Miami Beach Mayor and former Democratic House Leader Dan Gelber has been an advocate for open primaries for years. He wrote a letter to then-FDP Chair Manny Diaz more than three-and-half years ago, and followed up with a similar missive to Fried in March, noting how voters unaffiliated with the two major political parties are shut out of the process.
“Reaching out to these voters makes all the sense in the world,” he wrote. “Nearly thirty percent of all voters are unaffiliated independents, who don’t receive a single piece of mail, or phone call, or door knock until the primaries are decided. Adopting these measures will broaden our reach and incentivize our candidates to listen and interact with a more diverse group of the electorate.”
Both Gelber and Schale say they take seriously concerns the shift could hurt minority candidates. But Schale isn’t aware of “these huge parade of places where the community hasn’t gotten a voice that they want based on the way the district’s drawn, if that makes sense.”
A study published last fall by the Bipartisan Policy Center reported that turnout gaps among racial and ethic groups, “especially Latinos and Asians, are lower on average in open and nonpartisan primaries than closed primaries.” It did not track how minority candidates fared in open primary races, however.
Democratic 2026 gubernatorial candidate David Jolly, who was a nonparty-affiliated voter in Florida for the past seven years until he became a registered Democrat earlier this year, also supports Fried’s exploration, saying “it reflects bold leadership.”
“There’s no greater way to introduce independents and minor party members to Democratic values than to invite them in the tent,” he said in a text message. “In my experience, independents are smart voters who believe deeply in changing our politics — that is also the central tenet of today’s Democratic Party. I think there’s a natural affinity.”
The ultimate decision rests with the broader party committee, Jolly said, “and I trust their judgement and will support their decision.”
Other groups show support
Rank My Vote Florida, a statewide organization best known for advocating for ranked-choice voting (which was banned in Florida in 2022), is actively behind the proposal.
“We’ve been advocating for the Florida Democratic Party (FDP) to unilaterally open its primaries to independent voters (NPAs),” Rank My Vote Florida executive director Ramon Perez wrote in an email to his members last week.
“We’re working on this with a coalition of nonprofits that represent Florida’s diverse communities,” he wrote, adding that the group had “helped craft public statements of support” from the League of Women Voters of Florida, Veterans for All Voters, and Alianza for Progress (Perez did not respond to request for comment).
“All registered Florida voters deserve the opportunity to participate in primary elections and make their voices heard,” said League President Jessica Lowe-Minor in a written statement. “Closed primaries unfairly disenfranchise millions of voters, particularly independent and NPA voters, and contribute to political extremism. Any effort to reform our primary system to meaningfully increase voter participation and access is welcome.”
Although there remains some question whether the state of Florida would legally challenge the switch, Gelber noted that the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue in 1986 in Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut. The high court ruled states cannot impose a closed primary system because it would deny the political party its right under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to enter political association with individuals of its own choosing.
“We’re taking this process and trying to get as many viewpoints as possible,” Fried said. “Those people who decide to shut down the conversation without hearing the data and understanding the moment are living in an old-time political system.
“Times today are very different. And so it would be irresponsible of me to not bring this conversation to the Democratic Party … and so we want to make sure that we’re doing it right. We’re doing it methodically. We’re getting as many different viewpoints as possible, and ultimately the party executive meeting will dictate whether or not we move forward.”
That meeting has yet to be scheduled.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A pro-Palestinian activist who has been targeted for deportation by the Trump administration is seeking $20 million in damages from the federal government.
Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil, who was jailed in March and set for deportation until a federal judge in New Jersey ordered his release last month, said if Khalil’s bid for damages is successful, he would use the money to help others “similarly targeted by the Trump administration and Columbia University.” Khalil is a recent Columbia graduate and gained prominence with his anti-Israel protests on the school’s campus.
The Center for Constitutional Rights filed the request for damages in the form of a tort claim, a precursor to a federal lawsuit.
“The Trump administration’s unconstitutional targeting of Mr. Khalil led to severe harms that he continues to navigate, including financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress,” Samah Sisay, staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement. “The government must take accountability for their unlawful actions and compensate Mr. Khalil for his suffering.”
The center said Khalil would accept, in lieu of payment, an official apology from the Trump administration and the “abandonment of the administration’s unconstitutional policy.” Khalil, a Syrian-born legal resident of the United States, has argued he was arrested because of his anti-Israel advocacy.
The Trump administration claims he can be deported because that advocacy is “detrimental to American foreign policy interests.”
Khalil was detained at his New York home and eventually transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he spent a total of 104 days locked up. He was one of the first pro-Palestinian activists to face arrest and deportation by the Trump administration.
While in custody, cabinet officials publicly labeled Khalil as pro-Hamas, and Trump on social media said Khalil’s arrest was the first of many to come.  Those comments stained Khalil’s reputation, causing him to lose a job offer from a human rights nonprofit, Khalil’s lawyers say.
The new filing names the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the State Department and alleges claims of false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
“As a direct result of this unlawful conduct by U.S. officials, Mr. Khalil was deprived of his liberty. ICE officials undertook an unlawful and warrantless arrest of Mr. Khalil and transported him over long distances, all while being denied access to his attorney,” according to the Center.
The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.

Decreasing electric vehicle sales and changing U.S. policies are changing the plant's timeline to full production. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Panasonic is delaying full production in its De Soto battery plant because of dropping electric car sales and U.S. policies that do not support electric cars, international media reports. 
The $4 billion economic development project, billed as the largest in Kansas history, is threatened because of decreased electric car sales at Tesla and skepticism from President Donald Trump about encouraging electric vehicle adoption, according to the Nikkei Asia news outlet. 
The plant was expected to reach full production by March 2027, and a new target date has not been set, Nikkei reported.
The president’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminates tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles as of Sept. 30, along with eliminating or decreasing multiple green energy tax credits. 
The De Soto plant, which was projected to create 4,000 jobs, has a grand opening scheduled Monday. 
The Panasonic plant began construction in 2023 after receiving Kansas tax credits, through a program known as APEX that the state created to draw in large economic development projects. Incentives include rebates on capital investments, payroll and staff training. 
The APEX program also lowers the corporate income tax rate by 0.5% for Kansas businesses for the fiscal year after a megadeal is signed. Under the APEX deal, Panasonic was expected to receive $829.2 million over 10 years. 
The company had plans to provide at least 4,000 jobs, increasing the state’s annual labor income by more than $505 million. The state anticipated the project will create an additional 4,000 jobs through suppliers and community businesses. The state expected to see a $26 return for every $1 invested in tax incentives.
The De Soto community also offered incentives that were based on the company agreeing to employ 2,500 employees, well below the estimated full employment of 4,000. 
The city offered to complete $229 million of public infrastructure projects, such as road improvements, and water and sewer projects, using Tax Increment Financing funds, a common economic development tool that uses increased property taxes received from developments to fund projects.

During a typical shift, she shows up at her clients’ home at 10 p.m. She answers questions they may have about basic infant care and keeps an eye out for signs of postpartum depression.
After bedtime, she may feed the baby a bottle or wake the mother to breastfeed. She soothes the infant back to sleep. Sometimes, she prepares meals for the family in a Crock-Pot or empties the dishwasher.
She leaves the following morning and returns, often nightly, for two or three weeks in a row.
“I’m certified to do all of it,” said Oliver, of Hardeeville, South Carolina, who runs Compassionate Care Doula Services. It takes a village to raise a child, as the adage goes, but “the village is not what it used to be,” Oliver said.
Doulas are trained to offer critical support for families — before delivery, during childbirth, and in those daunting early days when parents are desperate for sleep and infants still wake up around the clock. While doulas typically don’t hold a medical or nursing degree, research shows they can improve health outcomes and reduce racial health disparities.
Yet their services remain out of reach for many families. Oliver charges $45 an hour overnight, and health insurance plans often don’t cover her fees. That’s partly why business “ebbs and flows,” Oliver said. Sometimes, she’s fully booked for months. Other times, she goes several weeks without a client.
That may soon change.
Two bipartisan bills, introduced in separate chambers of the South Carolina General Assembly, would require both Medicaid, which pays for more than half of all births in the state, and private insurers to cover the cost of doula services for patients who choose to use one.
South Carolina isn’t an outlier. Even as states brace for significant reductions in federal Medicaid funding over the next decade, legislatures across the country continue to pass laws that grant doula access to Medicaid beneficiaries. Some state laws already require private health insurers to do the same. Since the start of 2025, Vermont lawmakers, alongside Republican-controlled legislatures in Arkansas, Utah, Louisiana, and Montana, have passed laws to facilitate Medicaid coverage of doula services.
All told, more than 30 states, including Missouri, are reimbursing doulas through Medicaid or are implementing laws to do so.
Notably, these coverage requirements align with one of the goals of Project 2025, whose “Mandate for Leadership” report, published in 2023 by the conservative Heritage Foundation, offered a blueprint for President Donald Trump’s second term. The document calls for increasing access to doulas “for all women whether they are giving birth in a traditional hospital, through midwifery, or at home,” citing concerns about maternal mortality and postpartum depression, which may be “worsened by poor birth experiences.” The report also recommends that federal money not be used to train doctors, nurses, or doulas to perform abortions.
The Heritage Foundation did not respond to an interview request.
Meanwhile, the idea that doulas can benefit babies, parents, and state Medicaid budgets by reducing costly cesarean sections and preterm birth complications is supported by a growing body of research and is gaining traction among conservatives.
A study published last year in the American Journal of Public Health found that women enrolled in Medicaid who used a doula faced a 47% lower risk of delivering by C-section and a 29% lower risk of preterm birth. They were also 46% more likely to attend a postpartum checkup.
“Why wouldn’t you want somebody to avail themselves of that type of care?” said Republican state Rep. Tommy Pope, who co-sponsored the doula reimbursement bill in the South Carolina House of Representatives. “I don’t see any reason we shouldn’t be doing that.”
Pope said his daughter-in-law gave birth with the assistance of a doula. “It opened my eyes to the positive aspects,” he said.
Amy Chen, a senior attorney with the National Health Law Program, which tracks doula reimbursement legislation around the country as part of its Doula Medicaid Project, said lawmakers tend to support these efforts when they have a personal connection to the issue.
“It’s something that a lot of people resonate with,” Chen said, “even if they, themselves, have never been pregnant.”
Conservative lawmakers who endorse state-level abortion bans, she said, often vote in favor of measures that support pregnancy, motherhood, and infant health, all of which these doula reimbursement bills are intended to do.
Some Republicans feel as if “they have to come out in favor of that,” Chen said.
Health care research also suggests that Black patients, who suffer significantly higher maternal and infant mortality rates than white patients, may particularly benefit from doula care. In 2022, Black infants in South Carolina were more than twice as likely to die from all causes before their 1st birthday as white infants.
That holds true for women in rural parts of the country where labor and delivery services have either closed or never existed.
That’s why Montana lawmakers passed a doula reimbursement bill this year — to narrow health care gaps for rural and Indigenous communities. To that end, in 2023, the state enacted a bill that requires Medicaid to reimburse midwives for home births.
Montana state Sen. Mike Yakawich, a Republican who backed the Democratic-sponsored doula reimbursement bill, said pregnant women should have someone to call outside of a hospital, where health care services can be costly and intimidating.
“What help can we provide for moms who are expecting? My feeling is, it’s never enough,” Yakawich said.
Britney WolfVoice lives on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana, about two hours from the closest birthing hospital. In early July, she was seven months pregnant with her fourth child, a son, and said she planned to have a doula by her side for the second time in the delivery room. During WolfVoice’s previous pregnancy, an Indigenous doula named Misty Pipe brought cedar oil and spray into the delivery room, rubbed WolfVoice’s back through contractions, and helped ensure WolfVoice’s husband was the first person their daughter saw.
“Being in a hospital, I felt heard for the very first time,” WolfVoice said. “I just can’t explain it any better than I felt at home. She was my safe place.”
Pipe said hospitals are still associated with the government forcibly removing children from Native American homes as a consequence of colonization. Her goal is to help give people a voice during their pregnancy and delivery.
Most of her clients can’t afford to pay for doula services out-of-pocket, Pipe said, so she doesn’t charge anything for her birth services, balancing her role as a doula with her day job at a post office.
“If a mom is vulnerable, she could miss a prenatal appointment or go alone, or I can take time off of work and take her myself,” Pipe said. “No mom should have to birth in fear.”
The new state law will allow her to get paid for her work as a doula for the first time.
In some states that have enacted such laws, initial participation by doulas was low because Medicaid reimbursement rates weren’t high enough. Nationally, doula reimbursement rates are improving, Chen said.
For example, in Minnesota, where in 2013 lawmakers passed one of the first doula reimbursement bills, Medicaid initially paid only $411 per client for their services. Ten years later, the state had raised the reimbursement rate to a maximum of $3,200 a client.
But Chen said it is unclear how federal Medicaid cuts might affect the fate of these state laws.
Some states that haven’t passed doula reimbursement bills, including South Carolina, might be hesitant to do so in this environment, she said. “It’s just a really uncertain time.”

The districts said Walters' financial figures are inaccurate. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Disagreement between Oklahoma’s top education official and public school leaders continued this week over whether districts are well-funded enough to afford free cafeteria meals for all students.
After issuing an order Monday that all public schools begin offering no-cost food service, state Superintendent Ryan Walters followed up by identifying four districts that he said have enough money in surplus to afford the mandate.
Each of the four suburban districts — Bixby, Deer Creek, Piedmont and Broken Arrow — has said Walters made inaccurate allegations. They said the amounts Walters called a “surplus” seem to include bond money that cannot legally be used for school meals.
Claims from school leaders that they would have to lay off teachers and eliminate programs are merely “fear tactics,” Walters wrote in a statewide letter to public school parents on Thursday. The only part of a district’s budget he has said should be cut is administrator salaries.
Breakfast and lunch costs, he said, are another tax families have to pay on top of state and federal taxes.
“The direction should be simple to school districts — use the money that you have and stop triple taxing parents,” Walters stated in his letter Thursday. “Operate within your budget.”
His letter claims Piedmont Public Schools has $17.9 million in surplus.
In a message to families, Piedmont stated its actual end-of-year cash balance was $6.2 million as of June 30.
Districts carry money over from one school year to the next to pay employees and cover expenses during the summer months when they receive no funding from the state.
Many districts have additional funds from issuing school bonds, which can only be used for facility needs, technology, security and transportation equipment. 
“We can’t imagine Walters would be suggesting that we use bond money to pay for student meals,” Piedmont’s statement reads. “Using bond money would be a clear violation of the law. It is unfortunate that school districts have to spend their time and resources correcting misinformation sent by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.”
The cost to feed all Piedmont students is $4 million a year, an amount too great for the district’s budget to absorb, according to the statement.

Deer Creek’s general fund carryover balance is $12 million, Superintendent Jason Perez wrote in a districtwide message Friday. These are dollars the district will rely on over the coming months to cover payroll, utilities and operational costs, he said.
Deer Creek also is carrying over $2 million in a child nutrition fund. This money is already earmarked for other expenses — including kitchen remodels, a new kitchen construction and regular repairs — and cannot be redirected toward free meals, district spokesperson Maggie Leftwich said.
The district does not have a surplus of $48.7 million like Walters alleged, Perez said.
“Childhood food insecurity is a serious problem, but the mandates proposed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education are unrealistic and do not align with current Oklahoma statutes,” Perez wrote in his message to families. “It is my hope we can move beyond rhetoric and work together with our state leaders to solve this problem sustainably.”
A spokesperson for Broken Arrow Public Schools, Tara Thompson, said Walters’ allegation that it has $109.8 million in surplus is false.

This dollar figure seems to be derived by adding together funds — including bond money, debt service, scholarship funds and workers compensation — that cannot be used for anything other than their intended purpose. 
Bixby Superintendent Lydia Wilson said she is unable to verify how Walters calculated the $43.3 million he claimed her district has in surplus. 
She wrote in a letter to Bixby parents that she reached out to Walters’ office but hasn’t gotten a response.
“Upon reviewing fiscal reports submitted by the district on the state reporting website, it appears that Mr. Walters may have included multiple funding sources, some of which are legally restricted to specific purposes, such as bond funds,” Wilson wrote in her message to parents. “As he is surely aware, bond funds are governed by law and may only be used for designated projects that are clearly outlined in the bond resolution, approved by the community, and passed with a 60% supermajority vote.”
Wilson stated even a “crippling” 50% cut to Bixby’s administrator budget would allow the district to afford only 30% of the cost to provide all cafeteria meals for free. Taking on the entire $5 million cost would require “catastrophic” measures affecting programs, staffing and class sizes, she wrote in another letter earlier this week.
District officials, a leading Republican state lawmaker and the Oklahoma State School Boards Association all have said local school boards, not the state superintendent, decide whether a public school will provide free meals to all enrolled.

Larry Rhoden participate in an event on May 23, 2025, in Madison. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Reid Rasner says he’s paused his efforts to purchase TikTok for $47.45 billion and possibly place some of its operations in South Dakota.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden had thrown his support behind the bid from Rasner, a financial planner and failed 2024 U.S. Senate candidate.
Rasner Media’s website posted a press release Thursday saying the bid’s on pause “unless China makes substantial changes and demonstrates a genuine commitment to a transparent and lawful divestiture.”
The bid to buy TikTok “remains fully funded,” it said.
The press release blamed China for the pause. It said ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, “is attempting to spin off a diluted U.S. version of TikTok” that would keep the app’s core algorithm under Chinese control.
That “likely obfuscates what they have been doing to manipulate and spy on Americans,” Rasner said in the press release.
Rasner sues state lawmaker over social media slights
He’s also blamed a Wyoming state lawmaker for the TikTok deal’s troubles. Rasner filed a defamation lawsuit this week in Laramie County, Wyoming, against former state Sen. Anthony Bouchard for his alleged efforts to “jeopardize a major business acquisition” through disparaging social media posts.
Man who says he can move TikTok to South Dakota is a bust in Wyoming politics

Rasner told the Cowboy State Daily that the language in the lawsuit is a reference to the TikTok bid. 
In May 2024, Bouchard took to Facebook to call Rasner a “phony” and accuse him of misconduct during his college days, according to the lawsuit and screenshots provided in a press release from Rasner on the case.
Rasner “has suffered irreparable damage to his personal and professional reputation, which has now been forever diminished and tarnished,” the lawsuit said.
Bouchard declined to comment Friday.
Rasner Media born in February
In 2024, President Biden signed a bill into law that would either force the sale of TikTok to a U.S. owner or ban the app in the U.S. The Supreme Court found the law constitutional in January. President Trump has now twice extended the deadline for its sale, which is set for Sept. 17.
Rasner launched Rasner Media a month after the Supreme Court ruling. He’s since made the rounds in interviews on the app, calling his bid the “most Trumpian” and pledging to pay content creators dividends on the occasion of a TikTok sale if they invest in it through Rasner’s FoundersTok website.
Rasner also drew the support of Gov. Rhoden after offering to locate some of TikTok’s operations in South Dakota, calling the state the leading contender for a headquarters. The governor appeared alongside Rasner for a press conference in May at Dakota State University, a school that trains students in cybersecurity and data science.
Shortly after that visit, Rasner told a group of Wyoming business leaders that he’s always wanted Wyoming to host the company.
Financial questions
Like several of the content creators who’ve interviewed Rasner on the short-form video platform, the press release for Rasner’s South Dakota visit referred to him as a “Wyoming billionaire.”
A South Dakota Searchlight investigation called that claim into question. Rasner would not answer the question directly when asked.

The Cowboy State Daily asked Rasner about the article. He told the outlet he has “considerable wealth.”
“I’ve had very, very good success in business since high school, and I’ve built a really great life for myself,” he told the outlet.
Rasner’s financial disclosures to the Federal Election Commission for his unsuccessful campaign to unseat U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, showed that he’d earned a little more than $100,000 the year before that 2024 contest as a financial planner. 
He’d also earned more than $60,000 selling goods on eBay, owned a few pieces of property in Natrona County that brought him less than $50,000 of rental income, and had taken out a loan of more than $1 million from a family trust. 
He raised less than $35,000 in donations for his Senate campaign, excluding the money he loaned himself.
Rasner has yet to file the required paperwork to show that his campaign paid back the $1.2 million loan he made to his 2024 campaign. 
Rasner now has another U.S. Senate campaign committee — Wyoming’s junior U.S. senator is up for reelection in 2026 — that’s raised $105 in donations and lists $188,500 in loans Rasner’s made to his own campaign.
Rhoden response
Rasner has not disclosed the names of any financial backers to the TikTok bid. In a response to questions sent prior to the publication of Searchlight’s investigation, Rasner accused the outlet of liberal activism and bias.
Prior to the publication of Searchlight’s story on Rasner’s finances, Rhoden told the Scouting Report podcast that Rasner was “ready to go” to buy TikTok.
When asked last month after a tour of a Baltic-area dairy if he still has that level of confidence in Rasner’s bid, Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight that he’s “yet to have anybody tell me that there’s anything illegitimate about what he’s told me.”
“We haven’t offered him anything, and he hasn’t offered us anything,” the governor said, save the opportunity to talk about the possibility of locating the headquarters in the state.
“I’d certainly hope for that,” Rhoden said. “That’s a no-lose for South Dakota.”
Rasner did not immediately respond to a South Dakota Searchlight request Friday for comment on the pause of his TikTok bid.

(1966 file CDC photo by Skip Van Orden)A stray cat that bit and scratched a Coventry resident and later scratched an animal control officer has tested positive for rabies, the Rhode Island Department of Health announced Friday morning.
The Coventry resident was scratched after trapping the cat outside their home on Newell Court off Main Street on Monday, according to a state health official. However, a statement by Coventry Police Chief Benjamin H. Witt said the exposure was Tuesday. The cat was “acting abnormally” and had scratched and bitten the resident prior to the arrival of an animal control officer, according to the statement. The responding officer also sustained scratches while taking the cat into custody.
The health department confirmed the animal tested positive for rabies on Thursday. Following the test results, both the resident and animal control official were given post-exposure rabies treatments, the health department reported. Modern treatments are highly effective in staving off the otherwise deadly rabies virus.
 

How to reach Rhode Island Department of Health experts
Residents who believe their pets may have come in contact with the cat should call the Rhode Island Department of Health’s Center for Acute Infectious Disease Epidemiology at (401) 222-2577. The center is open weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. After normal business hours, the number to call is (401) 276-8046.



State law requires all dogs, cats, and ferrets to be vaccinated against rabies, as vaccination prevents pets from acquiring the disease and potentially sharing it with humans.
Witt’s statement noted that the Coventry residents who need help vaccinating their pets can call Coventry Animal Control at (401) 822-9106. People unsure of their pet’s vaccination status should contact their veterinarian.
Both Coventry police and state health officials recommend against feeding stray animals, or even their own animals outdoors as it can attract stray animals. “This is especially dangerous when feeding large numbers of free-roaming cats,”  according to a health department news release. 
Left untreated, rabies is nearly always fatal, with a mortality rate of around 100%. Prompt post-exposure treatment, however, virtually eliminates the risk of death. About 60,000 people receive post-exposure treatment each year in the United States, according to the U.S. National Park Service. 
There are about two or three human cases of rabies each year in the U.S. An October 2024 article in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases noted that no deaths had been recorded in patients who received modern post-exposure treatment until 2021, when an 84-year-old Minnesota man died six months after being bitten by a bat, despite receiving treatment. There are about 59,000 rabies deaths annually, mostly in developing countries in Africa and Asia where treatment access is limited.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Brooklyn Park voters will take to the polls on Sept. 16 to fill the vacant seat of Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed last month in a politically motivated assassination.
Gov. Tim Walz on Friday issued a writ of special election for the House District 34B seat, which encompasses parts of Anoka and Hennepin counties.
A special primary for the seat, if necessary, will be on Aug. 12.
Hortman and her husband were shot and killed on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home. Their deaths, along with the attempted assassination of Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, and his wife have left Minnesota in a state of shock and grief.
Hortman first ran for the House seat in 1998 and 2002 and lost both times before winning in 2004 in what was then a swing district. Like many suburban districts, it has since become solidly blue. In 2024, Hortman won her race by 26 percentage points over her Republican challenger and served as the House DFL caucus leader until her death.
Given the current status of the House — Republicans hold a 1-seat (67-66) advantage — Democrats are likely to take no chances, despite the near lock on keeping the seat. House Democrats will also likely knock on doors and fundraise to keep the seat blue in honor of their former leader. 
Brooklyn Park City Council member Christian Eriksen earlier this week announced that he intends to seek the DFL endorsement for the open seat.
“I know in our communities, this seat will endure as ‘Melissa’s Seat,’” Eriksen said in a social media post announcing his candidacy. “It is with great respect to her legacy, as well as the legacy of all those whom have served before us, that I run for this office.”
No Republican candidates have announced for the seat yet.

(Courtesy of Alexey Demin)Alexey Demin says he talks to his wife, Svetlana, on the phone almost every day. The Russian expatriate now lives in California with his stepdaughter, having been granted asylum in April. She’s at an immigration detention center in Louisiana, where she’s been held since September.
Alexey, 63, admits he holds back information from Svetlana, 56, during these calls.
“Physically, she is fine, but psychologically, it’s very difficult,” Alexey said in an online interview, translated through an interpreter. “Periodically, there are hysterics during our conversations. She throws the phone. Every call is a challenge. I also can’t tell her anything hopeful. I even hide the truth from her. The truth is the only certainty right now is that she’ll be deported.”
The truth is more like a strong hunch for Alexey, who said he’s had trouble staying in touch with the Seattle-based lawyer who has represented the couple. She’s also Russian and hasn’t returned calls, text messages or emails from a reporter. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not responded to questions about the status of Svetlana’s case. The Illuminator was able to confirm the status of the Demins’ immigration cases through an ICE online database.

The Demins are among countless families who have separated through the U.S. immigration enforcement system, though their difficulties began in the waning months of President Joe Biden’s term. The couple also followed the proper steps to obtain asylum, booking an appointment with officials online rather than trying to enter the country illegally. 
They attempted to relocate to the U.S. at a time when the federal government was trying to unravel a knotted immigration system with vast backlogs of court cases and asylum applications. Those with experience navigating the legal labyrinth say efforts to clear the bureaucratic morass under Biden have turned into a purposeful effort from Trump to expedite removals, regardless of whether families are impacted. 
ICE policy that calls for parents to be detained close to where their young children reside is now routinely ignored, said Nora Ahmed, an attorney with the ACLU of Louisiana. She was part of the legal team for Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student who was taken from his New York City apartment in March and detained at the ICE detention center in LaSalle Parish until a judge ordered his release last month. While in custody, Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdallah, gave birth to their first child.  
The Demins do not have young children, but Ahmed said their experience follows the same pattern of divisive immigration enforcement. 
“This is family separation 2.0,” she said. “It’s taking form in different ways. We’re not necessarily seeing kids in cages, but we are seeing the destruction of families and the destruction of family units.”

Punishment for protest
The Demins decided to leave Russia last year after Alexey said he had been threatened multiple times with punishment for his activism against President Vladimir Putin. Alexey’s disenchantment with his country’s leadership came after his 28-year career in the Russian navy as an engineer-geographer. 
After leaving the military, Alexey became a driver for members of the Russian cabinet during the early years of the Putin regime. He and Svetlana, who is his second wife, married in 2002, and Alexey gradually became more politically active as Putin’s autocratic power grew. Key events came in 2012, when Putin disregarded the Russian constitution and assumed his third term in office. Two years later, he annexed the Crimean Peninsula, and the Russian military steadily established its presence in the Donbas region of Ukraine. 
This led Alexey to publicly back opposition candidates, take part in protests against Putin and – in Alexey’s words – write political posts on Facebook that became “more and more dangerous.” 
Social media activity in Russia wasn’t actively policed until after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in September 2022, said Kathleen Smith, a political scientist and associate director of Georgetown University’s Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies. A law approved shortly afterward banned any criticism of Putin’s foreign policy, with penalties including hefty fines and prison time.
“Most people [in Russia] who say things on social media, nobody is ever going to get to them,” Smith said. “But you could be that unlucky person, and what you don’t want is some reason for the authorities to look at your social media or to look at your footprint.”
Alexey said he was detained twice after taking part in protests, but the real scare came from a former Russian navy colleague who threatened to ensure his punishment for criticizing Putin.    
“In addition to this constant pressure, more than once, the police showed up at my house, warning me that my activities could have criminal consequences,” he said. “My wife and I discussed this and, before the incident with my former colleague, there were many instances where we felt in danger. It was also psychologically difficult and demoralizing to know we were part of a country that, in our view, is committing crimes and acts of aggression against Ukraine.”

‘I was never denied freedom’
Alexey and Svetlana left Russia on Oct. 17, 2024, traveling through Dubai to reach Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, the next day. Once there, they made attempts every day to secure an appointment through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection app, CBP One.
It would take months for them to arrange that meeting, with the couple unable to secure jobs during their extended stay in Mexico because of their transient status. They earned money from renting their home back in Russia, but the income wasn’t going to support them for long, Alexey said. Their ultimate goal was to reunite with Svetlana’s daughter and granddaughter in California, who both have legal status in the U.S.
In mid-June – eight months after their arrival in Mexico – the Demins locked in their CBP appointment. It was set for July 5, and the couple flew to Mexicali to cross the border. Immigration personnel met them there and escorted them to the Calexico border station, where Alexey said he and his wife were handcuffed upon arrival. 
“This was not easy psychologically,” Alexey said. “I’d never been handcuffed before in my life. I was never denied freedom. I was never a criminal element. Neither was my wife.”
The Demins were then taken to the station’s second floor, where they were placed in separate sections of makeshift holding cells. They were given small, thin mattresses and foil blankets, Alexey said. He also wasn’t allowed to talk with Svetlana.
“The one time I tried to do this, a CBP officer told me the next time, he’d send me to an isolated cell,” he said.
The Demins last saw one another July 8, 2024, when Alexey was transferred to a nearby ICE detention center. It was the first of three sites where he would be held – one in Texas, another in Virginia – before he was granted asylum April 17. 
  Alexey Demin said he speaks almost daily to his wife, Svetlana, who is being held at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile. He is reluctant to tell her that he feels she will mostly likely be deported rather than granted asylum. (Courtesy of Alexey Demin).
Couple wanted to combine asylum cases
Svetlana was kept at the CBP station 10 days before she was sent to another ICE site near San Diego. In September, she was sent to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana.
While they were both in custody, communication between the couple was limited. Alexey said scheduling calls would take weeks, and coordinating their asylum cases was impossible.   
The couple’s strategy was to make their appeal for asylum together, with plans to emphasize the risk Alexey faced back in Russia for being so outspoken. Svetlana was not nearly as active in anti-Putin protests, he said. 
Smith, the Georgetown political scientist, said this approach lines up with Russian society’s prevailing paternalistic views toward women involved in political protest. Authorities typically don’t target women, she said, assuming they are following the lead of men.    
“In this case, they’d be telling her, like, ‘Grandma, go home. Mind your own business. Don’t get involved,’” Smith said. “They essentially take male protesters more seriously. So the fact that she wasn’t detained is not evidence that she didn’t participate in protests. It’s probably more about the policing system.” 
By the time Alexey was given asylum in April, Svetlana had lost her case in March. Immigration court procedure provides her 30 days to appeal her ruling, but it’s not clear where she stands in that process. 
Ahmed, the ACLU attorney, said asylum applicants were typically granted parole prior to Trump returning to office. This allowed them the time, freedom and access to information to build their case. But in ICE detention, none of these resources are available, she said.
“Your best shot at getting asylum granted is to get an attorney,” Ahmed said. “But you also need to be on the outside to be able to get the evidence because it’s not like you even have Google available to you [in detention].”
More than 1.4 million asylum applications were pending at the end of 2024, according to the most recent U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data. Just more than 100,000 were granted asylum last year.
U.S. Department of Justice numbers for 2023 showed 1,745 people from Russia received asylum out of more than 2,800 applicants. Since the start of the war with Ukraine, 118,000 Russians have filed applications through CBP One, The Moscow Times reported in January.   
In California, Alexey’s ability to assist his wife is extremely limited. He said U.S. immigration officials still haven’t returned his passport and personal documents, making traveling to Louisiana unfeasible. He can’t travel, apply for a job or open a bank account.
His sole source of support is his stepdaughter, who declined to be interviewed out of fear that bringing attention to her mother would lead to her deportation. 
Alexey was also reluctant to share their story but ultimately decided the alternative was not an option.
“I’m afraid to hurt her, but I didn’t come to America only to live the same way I did in Russia, where silence was the price for freedom,” he said. “What’s the point of coming to America if all I do is stay silent?”

Court of Claims Judge James Robert Redford, in a July 3 order, granted a host of plaintiffs class certification, allowing them to move forward with a class action suit against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Department of Natural Resources. 
The plaintiffs will move forward under three classes: the real property class, or all persons who owned property in the impacted area; the personal property class, or all people who owned or leased property in the impacted area and the business class, which encompasses individuals who owned a business in the impacted area. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The plaintiffs allege the two departments are responsible for the collapse, arguing that state regulators ignored repeated warnings about safety risks, but continued to permit the dam operator, Boyce Hydro, to raise the water levels within the lake created by the Edenville Dam. According to the July 3 order, the agencies have denied all claims in the lawsuit.
“We are pleased that the court has certified this case as a class action, allowing a single trial to determine whether the State of Michigan is responsible for the Edenville Dam failure,” Jason T. Thompson, an attorney representing the class plaintiffs, said in a statement. “This decision paves the way for thousands of individuals and hundreds of businesses—whose lives and livelihoods were upended by the catastrophic flood—to seek justice through an efficient and unified process. We look forward to presenting the case at trial in January 2026 and working toward a fair and equitable resolution to this five-year legal battle.”

Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General, which is representing the two departments, said the Edenville Dam’s failure was tragic and the Attorney General sympathizes with those impacted by the dam’s collapse. However, the state is not responsible, he said. 
“We expect this litigation will not be successful as the plaintiffs do not have evidence to support their allegations. Conversely, the evidence in this matter confirms that the state agencies are not responsible for the dam’s failure,” Wimmer said.
 The Edenville Dam was not a state dam, Wimmer noted, with flood survivors suing the dam’s owner and forcing them to liquidate their assets. State agencies also sued the dam’s owner, resulting in a nearly $120 million judgment for violating Michigan’s Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act.
“The parties agreed to the Court’s limited certification of the liability class in this matter; this was not a contested issue before the Court,” Wimmer said, noting the liability class is only tied to the matter of liability.

The civil rights nonprofit said on Thursday that Margaret Huang, the president and CEO of SPLC, was stepping down from her role. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Southern Poverty Law Center President and CEO Margaret Huang has resigned from the nonprofit after serving in the role for five years.
SPLC announced Huang’s resignation in a statement on Thursday. The release from the civil rights organization said Huang planned to focus more on her family.
“Margaret has led SPLC with deep care, clarity and conviction, guiding us through moments of growth and moments of challenge,” said Karen Baynes-Dunning, the current chair of the SPLC Board of Directors, in a statement. “Her legacy is woven into the fabric of this organization, and we are well positioned in part because of her leadership.”
Bryan Fair, a former board chair and constitutional scholar at the University of Alabama, will succeed Huang as the leader of the organization on an interim basis.
“The board is confident that he will provide steady, familiar and thoughtful leadership throughout the transition and as a national search for a new leader is conducted. With his guidance, the center remains grounded in its values and prepared to meet the future with strength and purpose,” Baynes-Dunning said in the statement.
A message was sent to SPLC on Friday seeking additional comment.
Huang, previously executive director of Amnesty International USA, took the reins of the organization in 2020 after a year of turmoil. The organization ousted co-founder Morris Dees in 2019 amid questions about racial and gender equity in the SPLC. Dees’ ouster was followed by the resignation of several top SPLC executives.

As CEO, Huang tried to steer SPLC to include community organizing in its mission, particularly as an increasingly conservative judiciary made its litigation strategies more difficult. As part of that effort, it has hosted training sessions for individuals and organizations to train them on how to advocate and organize.
But SPLC announced in June 2024 that it would lay off employees in what the organization characterized as “streamlining operations.” SPLC’s employee union indicated that at least 60 people had lost their jobs due to$13 million deficit.
That September, the union overwhelmingly approved a no-confidence motion regarding Huang’s leadership.
A message was sent to the SPLC Union Friday seeking comment.
Fair, the interim CEO, will take leave from the University of Alabama while serving in the role. He has taught constitutional law for 34 years at the law school while also previously serving as a member of several other nonprofits, from the Equal Justice Initiative to Alabama Appleseed.
According to SPLC’s most recent 990 filing, the organization had $129 million in revenue between Nov. 1, 2023 and Oct. 31, 2024, down from $169.8 million in revenue the previous year. It reported expenses of $128.9 million for the period, and total assets of $786.7 million on Oct. 31, 2024.

(Building photo via Google Earth; document excerpt from the Iowa Board of Nursing) State regulators say they have never inspected and are not investigating a home health agency alleged to have falsified records, billed for services never delivered and used an unlicensed nurse.
State records show that Compassion North America, a home health provider based in Cedar Rapids, was incorporated in 2017 with M’balu Madlene Kebbie, a registered nurse, as its director, but was not licensed by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing until September 2024.
When asked about that, department spokeswoman Diane McCool said it’s possible the company was not providing any medical services in Iowa prior to being licensed last summer.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, records from the Iowa Board of Nursing, which is administered by DIAL, and sworn testimony from a state health investigator at a hearing overseen by DIAL, indicate the company has been providing medical care for clients at least since June 2022.
In addition, the company’s archived website indicates that in February 2021, Compassion North America was offering clients and patients a range of “nursing plans” and “medical intervention” to meet their care needs.
McCool said DIAL has never inspected Compassion North America due to it being inspected and accredited by a private organization, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care. She said DIAL does not have copies of the organization’s inspection findings, and the ACHC did not respond to the Iowa Capital Dispatch’s calls and emails on the matter.
Compassion North America’s CEO, Joseph Lemor, who is married to Kebbie, referred questions on his company’s licensing and accreditation to attorney David L. Brown, who indicated he had no information to share on those specific issues.
Lemor has said the state is engaged in a “witch hunt” with regard to Kebbie.  “We did not do anything improper,” he told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last week. “We have nothing to hide.”
DIAL: No investigation of home health agency
McCool said DIAL, as Iowa’s regulator of home health agencies, is not currently investigating Compassion North America — despite the findings of the Board of Nursing or its investigator that the company falsified records, billed for services that appear to have never been delivered, and employed an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.
Those allegations surfaced recently at a Board of Nursing disciplinary hearing for Kebbie.
In September 2022, the board alleges, it received a complaint from a patient, “G.F.,” who alleged Compassion had assigned unlicensed staff to perform skilled nursing care tasks, and that the staff failed to complete documentation of the care provided in his home.
Compassion North America was approved by Iowa Medicaid’s managed care organization, Amerigroup, to provide care for G.F. from June 29, 2022, through Aug. 29, 2022 — during which time the company was not licensed as a home health provider, according to DIAL.
A state investigator allegedly reviewed the work schedules of Compassion employees, which reportedly showed the company was not actually providing 24/7 care to G.F. as ordered.  The caregivers listed on the work schedule allegedly included four individuals, only two of whom — Kebbie and licensed practical nurse Elizabeth Smith — were licensed nurses.
However, Smith’s nursing license had expired in January 2021 and was not reactivated until 18 months later, on July 6, 2022.
The state investigator reviewed thousands of pages of records subpoenaed from Compassion, the board says, and concluded Smith was the only nurse to document any nursing care for G.F. from June 29, 2022, through July 1, 2022 — during which time Smith was unlicensed.
In addition, a comparison of Compassion’s billing records with the staff work schedule allegedly showed the company had submitted payment claims for services for which there was no corresponding documentation to indicate the care was provided. There were also payment claims for services provided by a registered nurse that exceeded 24 hours in a single day, the state investigator testified.
Board cites ‘fraudulent practices,’ fabricated records 
According to the board, Kebbie had no explanation for the irregularities in the nursing documentation — including instances where it appeared Compassion had billed Medicaid twice for services related to G.F.’s care.
With regard to allegations that Kebbie had improperly delegated to Smith certain tasks that were outside the scope of Smith’s license, the board concluded the documents supporting that claim were most likely fabricated by Compassion after the fact — and so, the board reasoned, there was “insufficient evidence” to support the allegation.
The board also found the evidence suggested Kebbie failed to properly delegate G.F.’s care to Smith, and alleged Kebbie admitted she had not reviewed Smith’s documentation of G.F.’s care.
As for the allegations of falsified records, the board dismissed that charge as it related to Kebbie while noting there was evidence “someone associated with Compassion” had falsified documents. Had Kebbie properly reviewed her subordinate’s records, the board said, “she would have known fraudulent practices had occurred.”
Citing what it called Kebbie’s “lack of previous disciplinary history,” the board ruled that she could retain her Iowa nursing license subject to two years of probation. However, the board’s own records indicate that in 2012, it fined Kebbie $50 for briefly working as a nurse while her license was inactive.
Nurse appeals board sanction
Earlier this week, Kebbie’s attorney filed an appeal of that decision in Polk County District Court, arguing the sanctions are “unreasonable, arbitrary, and excessive.”
In her appeal, Kebbie alleges the matter should never have proceeded to a disciplinary hearing because the board “erred in its rejection of a settlement agreement” she and her attorney negotiated with Assistant Attorney General Samantha Wagner.
Kebbie also claims Wagner had suggested that continuing-education courses “or even a simple essay” describing the proper process for delegating duties would have been an appropriate way to address Kebbie’s conduct.
The appeal also takes issue with the fact that the state’s only witness at the hearing, aside from Kebbie, was state investigator Kathleen Beebout. In the absence of corroborating testimony to back up Beebout’s claims, Kebbie alleges, the board lacked a factual foundation to support any of the allegations against her.
Kebbie also claims the board’s allegation that she admitted failing to review a subordinate’s care for G.F. is false, and says Wagner admitted the state “has no reason to disbelieve that Ms. Kebbie is a caring nurse, that she works very hard, and that the services she provides herself are excellent.”
The state has yet to respond to the appeal.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)A new lawsuit filed this week in Dane County Circuit Court seeks to have Wisconsin’s congressional maps declared an unconstitutional, anti-competitive gerrymander and thrown out. 
The suit, filed Tuesday, is another attempt by Democrats and their allies to have new maps drawn before the 2026 midterm elections. Just a few weeks ago, the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to hear two challenges to the current congressional districts. 
Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional districts. Democrats have focused on southern Wisconsin’s First District, currently held by Rep. Bryan Steil, and western Wisconsin’s Third District, currently held by Rep. Derrick Van Orden, as possible targets. 
The current maps were drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and selected by the state Supreme Court, which was at the time controlled by conservatives. In that case, the Court had ruled that any proposed maps must follow a “least change” standard and adhere as closely as possible to the maps installed by Republicans in 2011. 
The new lawsuit was filed at the local level, rather than directly with the Supreme Court as an original action, a slower process but perhaps more likely to be taken up by the Court — which has declined to hear challenges to the congressional maps a handful of times in the last few years, despite the Court’s liberal wing gaining majority control after the 2023 Supreme Court election. 
The new suit was filed by attorneys from voting rights focused Law Forward on behalf of the bipartisan business group Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy Coalition, arguing that the current maps are unconstitutional because they’re anti-competitive. Previous challenges to the maps argued the districts were rigged to benefit the Republican party and violated equal protection laws. 
“Wisconsin’s current congressional plan presents a textbook example of an anti-competitive gerrymander,” the lawsuit states. “Anti-competitive gerrymanders are every bit as noxious to democracy as partisan gerrymanders and racial gerrymanders.”
The lawsuit adds that Wisconsin’s maps are an “anti-competitive gerrymander that artificially suppresses electoral competition.” The suit argues that when the congressional maps were drawn in 2011, the lines were drawn to protect incumbents of both parties. When those maps were largely kept intact by the Supreme Court’s “least change” standard in 2021, the decision to insulate incumbents was carried over. 
“After the Wisconsin Legislature adopted the 2011 congressional map, congressional races over the ensuing decade were, as intended, highly uncompetitive,” the lawsuit states, noting that only one congressional election under those maps was decided by less than 10 percentage points. “The Court’s adoption … of the ‘least change’ congressional map necessarily perpetuated the essential features — and the primary flaws — of the 2011 congressional map, including the 2011 congressional map’s intentional and effective effort to suppress competition.”

Canvassers met Thursday initially to move the initiative forward, but they walked back an earlier approval of the Invest in MI Kids summary language, noting that the proposal’s committee altered the language hours before the public comment period closed.
On Friday, the committee said in a news release that it has already trained thousands of volunteers and plans to restart in August. The committee also blamed the situation on a clerical delay.
“This delay is a blessing in disguise; now we get to lay more solid groundwork with our grassroots partners who’ve been chomping at the bit to get started,” Charlie Cavell, an Oakland County coordinator with Invest In MI Kids, said in a statement.
The Invest in MI Kids’ proposal would add a 5% surcharge on state income taxes over the constitutional flat tax rate of 4.25% for individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million.
The state’s schools are estimated to be underfunded at $4 billion to $5 billion annually, the coalition said. The ballot measure, which needs 600,000 signatures to be placed on the statewide ballot in the next election cycle, would direct new revenue to Michigan’s School Aid Fund and allow funding for things like career and technical education, attracting and retaining teachers, and reducing class sizes. That would have a positive impact on underfunded and underserved communities, the coalition added, with the revenue estimated to generate $1.7 billion annually for public K-12 schools.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from KU Health video)Michelle Williams describes herself as a challenge medically.
While battling numerous chronic illnesses related to her lungs and heart, her doctors noticed her parathyroid levels in her throat were impacting her calcium, which were causing her to have severe brain fog, fatigue and muscle pain.
Williams first noticed that something was off when she couldn’t remember what she was grabbing from the refrigerator. Then she would forget what she was going to say halfway through her sentences.
“I wasn’t even thinking things through,” Williams said. “I would start a sentence and then lose my train of thought.”
Williams, from Lawrence, shared her story of hyperparathyroidism during a recent University of Kansas Health System news briefing.
She was given the option of medication for her hyperparathyroidism, but medication doesn’t fully resolve the issue on its own. With help from her doctors, she made the difficult decision to have surgery to remove two of her four parathyroid glands in her throat.
“To find a doctor that was willing to do the surgery and do it as safely as we could, that was exciting to me,” Williams said. “Everything affects everything else. I was really eager to do whatever was necessary.”
The glands are each the size of a grain of rice and are unrelated to the thyroid’s function. They can be very hard for doctors to locate even with scans. The surgery is very delicate, and with Williams being a singer, her doctors warned her of the possibility of damage to her voice.
“The risk is low, but not zero,” KU Health head and neck surgeon Erin Buczek said. “In Michelle’s case, all the imaging indicated the problem parathyroid gland was on the right. We removed it but the parathyroid levels didn’t drop as expected. At this point, we explored the left side and found the culprit parathyroid gland.”
Williams’ operation was a success, with her coming out of surgery with her voice fully intact.
Buczek performs 80 to 85 parathyroid surgeries every year. She says symptoms often start at different times, which make it much more difficult to diagnose.
“Symptoms can be subtle or not very severe and also attributed to a lot of other medical problems,” Buczek said. “Hyperthyroidism can cause pain over all parts of the body. When someone has an elevated calcium level, it can affect everything.”
Williams has made a full recovery after her operation but still takes a variety of medications for her other health issues. Her morning medications add up to 12 pills. 
“I take meds about five times a day,” Williams said. “Just some of those retail at $60,000 a month.”
Because of the high prices of her medications, Williams applied for grants to get help.
“The hospital and doctors told me to call this organization, or funding is open so make some calls,” she said. “Private donations help people like myself with very rare diseases.”
Williams will not need any other treatment for hyperthyroidism after the surgery. 
Buczek said anyone who is experiencing symptoms should get lab work done by a doctor.
“I want to share because someone out there is suffering silently,” Williams said. “I want to share my story so people don’t think they’re alone.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/MichelleWilliamsKU-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-11 14:12:28.048957

A new study sheds lights on the increasing loss of obstetric services across America. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.
Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.
“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.

Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).
Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

(Photo by William Thomas Cain/Getty Images)The country’s largest venture capital this week announced it is moving its state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, and it encouraged other venture capitalists to follow suit.
Andreessen Horowitz’s move is the latest sign there may be momentum in the push to establish the Silver State as a premier destination for corporate litigation.
In its lengthy post announcing and explaining the move, the firm criticized Delaware’s Court of Chancery, writing that it has “injected an unprecedented level of subjectivity into judicial decisions, undermining the court’s reputation for unbiased expertise.” Nevada, by contrast, has “historically been a business friendly state with fair and balanced regulatory policies,” read the blog.
Why some think Nevada should challenge Delaware as premier destination for corporate lawsuits

The post continued to say that Nevada codifies business judgment rules in statute, “making it more predictable and less subject to court reinterpretation.” And that Nevada only allows shareholders with 15% or more ownership to inspect records, “reducing legal fishing expeditions.”
Andreessen Horowitz referenced two recent legislative measures in Nevada “that take significant steps toward upgrading its existing business courts into specialized venues to resolve complex commercial disputes.” The first, Assembly Joint Resolution 8, would have Nevadans in 2028 vote to approve the creation of a specialized business court with judges appointed by the governor. The second, Assembly Bill 239, allows jury trials in civil cases to be waived.
Both bills were sponsored by first-term Assemblymember Joe Dalia, a Democrat from Las Vegas.
Paralleling Dalia’s efforts, Nevada Supreme Court Chief Justice Doug Herndon in May announced he would be taking steps to internally establish a specialized business court, which he believes can happen “within a year” and without changing the state constitution as proposed in AJR8. No update on that effort was available Thursday.
Dalia and other proponents of a specialized business court argue it could become a significant revenue maker for the state. They also believe Nevada needs to move on the idea and capitalize on corporations’ frustrations with Delaware, which have prompted what some call a “Dexit” from the state.
Other companies that have left Delaware for Nevada in recent years include X, Dropbox, and TripAdvisor, which overcame a lawsuit from shareholders who tried to bar it from incorporating in Nevada.
Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat whose office oversees business entity formation, filed an amicus brief in that case defending Nevada as a viable place for incorporation.
A social media post by Andreessen Horowitz highlighting the decision was shared by Dalia, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, and Democratic State Treasurer Zach Conine.
One of Andreessen Horowitz’s co-founders already has strong personal ties to Las Vegas. Benjamin Horowitz and his wife, Felicia, have lived in the Las Vegas area since 2021 or 2022, according to media reports, and have quickly become prominent local donors. 
Horowitz made headlines earlier this year when he was identified as the donor of 10 Tesla Cybertrucks given to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. The Horowitzes have reportedly donated at least $7.6 million to the police department.
The donations have raised concerns about conflicts of interest as some of the technology donated came from companies Andreessen Horowitz is invested in.
Horowitz has defended the donations, writing in a blog post that “the public sector often has trouble budgeting for strategic technology projects” so his donations “give LVMPD a running start.”
The Horowitzes have donated $300,000 to political candidates in the last four years, according to the state’s campaign contribution database. That included $20,000 each to Lombardo (for his 2021 gubernatorial campaign), Kevin McMahill (for his successful run to replace Lombardo as Clark County sheriff), and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson (for his latest re-election campaign).
Last year, during the 2024 election cycle, the Horowitzes gave $220,000 to Republicans candidates running for the Nevada State Legislature. Those donations included $20,000 each to Republican incumbents Assemblymember John Ellison and state Sen. Carrie Buck, as well as $20,000 each to John Steinbeck, Lori Rogich, Rebecca Edgeworth, and Lisa Cole, who secured seats last year.
An additional five candidates received $20,000 in donations but were not elected. That group of candidates included Annette Dawson Owens, who ran against Dalia for an open seat.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2994066-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-11 13:20:49.840125

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Days after declaring victory in his administration’s push to cut regulatory red tape by 25%, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is now looking to artificial intelligence to help push that number even higher.
In an executive order issued Friday, Youngkin announced Virginia will launch the nation’s first “agentic AI” pilot program designed to streamline state regulations and guidance documents. The initiative will scan thousands of pages of agency rules using generative AI to identify redundancies, contradictions and overly complex language — all in the name of efficiency.
“We have made tremendous strides towards streamlining regulations and the regulatory process in the commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Using emergent artificial intelligence tools, we will push this effort further in order to continue our mission of unleashing Virginia’s economy in a way that benefits all of its citizens.”
The move builds on the administration’s broader deregulation campaign, which this week marked a milestone by surpassing a 25% reduction in regulatory requirements across state government six months ahead of schedule. It’s unclear exactly which regulations have been shaved off, and Youngkin’s press officer hasn’t responded to questions about the methodology powering the process.
“The 25% was broken through, and I’m convinced we can get to 35,” Youngkin said Tuesday at an event in Richmond. “It’s about setting targets and hitting them — and then blowing through them and doing even more.”
The new AI pilot, officials say, is a first-of-its-kind effort at the state level. The technology will comb through existing regulations and guidance documents to flag conflicting language, suggest clearer phrasing, and help agencies that haven’t already met or exceeded the 25% reduction benchmark hit the mark. The administration says the tool will also empower agencies to conduct future reviews with greater ease.
“The ‘Virginia model’ for regulatory modernization has become the gold standard across the U.S., with other states and federal agencies looking to replicate our reforms,” said Reeve Bull, director of the Office of Regulatory Management. 
A Youngkin spokesman did not respond Friday to a question asking whether artificial intelligence had already played a role in reaching the initial 25% cut. But officials say the new pilot will “supercharge” the process — especially for agencies still struggling to hit the original target.
As of this week, Virginia agencies had eliminated 47.9% of the words in their guidance documents and streamlined 26.8% of the regulatory requirements on the books, the administration said in a news release, emphasizing that most agencies are on track to meet or exceed the 25% goal, while a handful may need an extra push — potentially from AI.
“The Office of Transformation continues to look for ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our state government,” said Chief Transformation Officer Rob Ward. “We look forward to working with our Office of Regulatory Management to apply the power of AI to our regulatory environment.”
Youngkin has tied the regulatory rollback to what he views as broader economic success in Virginia. At Tuesday’s event inside a sweltering Southside Richmond warehouse, he rattled off investment and job creation numbers alongside regulatory cuts — $120 billion in new business commitments, 270,000 new jobs, and 15,000 high-growth startups.
“Today is about results,” he told supporters and business leaders. “Today is about commitments kept. Today is about promises made — and a team of extraordinary individuals working together to keep those promises.”
The reform effort stems from Executive Order 19, signed in 2022, which launched a sweeping, government-wide audit of regulations, permitting practices, and guidance documents. That process has resulted in the streamlining or repeal of nearly 89,000 individual requirements, officials said.
Among the most visible impacts are regulatory timelines at the Department of Environmental Quality that have reportedly dropped by 65%, while the Virginia Department of Transportation has cut 20,000 regulatory items. 
In housing, Youngkin said updated building code rules reduced the cost of constructing a new home by nearly 6%, saving homebuyers roughly $24,000. Brian Horn, at the time director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, led the charge on that front, streamlining more than 48,000 housing-related regulations. 
Environmental regulations were also a target. Andrew Wheeler, former EPA chief under President Donald Trump and now a key architect of Virginia’s regulatory review system, said his office found that more than half of all regulations had been drafted by agencies without external review. He highlighted stormwater regulations as one area where the volume of rules was drastically reduced — from 23 inches of printed materials to just five.
Still, Youngkin has emphasized that the effort wasn’t about cutting corners. “We’re not saying all regs are bad,” he said. “What we’re saying is excess regulation is bad.”
To track agency progress, Youngkin told reporters that the administration has been using a color-coded dashboard — green for those ahead of schedule, yellow for those close behind, and red for laggards. 
And as Virginia eyes a new 35% reduction target, the AI pilot is expected to help maintain momentum across the board, the administration said.

The U.S. is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain roughly 300 men at the prison.ProsecutionAs soon as Wednesday, Abrego Garcia could be released from pre-trial detention on charges that accuse him of human smuggling that stem from a 2019 traffic stop. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in Tennessee federal court on an order pausing Abrego Garcia’s release, at his lawyers’ request over concerns the administration could deport him if he is released from jail.DOJ attorneys have said that the Trump administration intends to deport Abrego Garcia before his trial in Tennessee is complete.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges. His attorneys have accused President Donald Trump’s administration of using the indictment to save face in light of court orders finding Abrego Garcia's deportation unlawful and the Supreme Court’s order for the federal government to facilitate his return.Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections in place since 2019, barring his removal to his native El Salvador due to concerns he would experience gang violence there.The Trump administration has labeled Abrego Garcia a leader of the gang MS-13, but has not produced any evidence of those allegations in court.Xinis also raised the concern that Abrego Garcia could face harm in a third country because the Trump administration has labeled him a gang leader.She raised the possibility that if Abrego Garcia is deported to a third country, that country could then take him to El Salvador.ICE detainer producedThe Trump administration has placed a detainer on Abrego Garcia upon his potential release, meaning U.S. Marshals would hold him until immigration agents can arrest him and take him into custody.Xinis has repeatedly asked DOJ lawyers for a copy of the detainer to determine what statue Abrego Garcia is being detained on.DOJ attorneys said they were still working on it and Xinis slammed them for not producing it and said she wouldn’t take the DOJ's word that the detainer even existed.“You have taken the presumption of regularity and you’ve destroyed it, in my view,” Xinis said.Halfway through the hearing, DOJ attorney Sarmad M. Khojasteh produced the detainer and gave a copy to Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, who have also been asking for a copy of the form.Rossman said the detainer “has a massive hole in it.”He said that according to the detainer, the reason for holding Abrego Garcia is a final order of removal.However, a top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified Thursday that because Abrego Garcia is not in removal proceedings yet, the federal government cannot detail what actions it will take in removing him.“We have an obvious chicken-and-egg problem,” Rossman said.DOJ argument ‘defies reality’Thomas Giles, ICE’s assistant director for enforcement and removal operations who testified Thursday, could not detail which track the Trump administration planned to take for Abrego Garcia. The agency is likely to try either deporting him to a third country or  challenge the bar on removal to El Salvador.Xinis also expressed doubt that the Trump administration has not had conversations on what to do about Abrego Garcia, given the high-profile nature of the case.Khojasteh said that an immigration officer would determine next steps for Abrego Garcia.“It defies reality that this is going to be left to a desk officer,” Xinis said.Xinis said she’ll make a decision before Wednesday on a temporary restraining order.",,,,2025-07-11 13:20:49.840125

Gov. Jeff Landry announced Friday that Michael Hare will become the new executive director of the state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. The governor moved his predecessor, Glenn Ledet Jr., to the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, where Landry is leading a reorganization effort. 
Hare graduated from Louisiana State University in 2002 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and earned a master’s degree in foreign policy from American University in Washington, D.C., in 2004. He returned to LSU for master’s degree in business administration in 2019
Hare ran his own environmental markets advising company, Wildhare Solutions, based in Lafayette. Previously, he was director of government affairs and business development at Resource Environmental Solutions and a legislative assistant to former U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette.

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.


Measles in Washington
Washington state has confirmed 10 measles cases this year in three counties: King, Snohomish and Whatcom.
But Washington hasn’t seen any outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases, according to the state Department of Health.
The agency posts measles updates on its website.


“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

Pete Ricketts. He is pictured presiding over the Nebraska Legislature in 2022. (Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State Auditor Mike Foley says some struggles continue for Nebraska’s African American Affairs Commission, citing new concerns about how the commission has documented its meetings and expenses. 
Foley released a 60-page audit of the commission Friday, highlighting issues including potential violations of the Open Meetings Act and inadequate documentation of commission expenses. Foley said his office focused attention on the fairly young commission — established by the Nebraska Legislature in 2020 — because of its brief history of staff turnover and turmoil 
“They’re just struggling to get started,” Foley said. 
Commission officials defended some individual allegations in the commission’s response that was included in the audit, but the group largely agreed to enforce more robust policies, procedures and documentation going forward. 
“With the Commission being newly formed, there was difference of opinions regarding the recording of the minutes,” the commission wrote in response to the Open Meetings Act allegations. “We will require that the Commission is trained on Roberts Rules of Order. Also, that the Chairs are trained on the proper conduct of meetings and transparency with documenting the public meeting notices.”
A history of turnover 
This isn’t the first time Foley has raised concerns with the commission. In 2024, Foley and Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers called out “substantial defects” in how the commission handled the appointment of its former interim director, John Carter. This audit addressed the incident, too.

It alleges that Carter “fraudulently misrepresented” his appointment to the state’s Department of Administrative Services, claiming the commission had voted him in as interim director when multiple commissioners claimed there was no formal vote. This vote also allegedly happened in a closed session, which would violate Nebraska’s open meetings law, the audit alleges. 
Carter was interim director for less than three months in early 2024. At the time, Carter said he felt he was being forced out and accused the governor’s office of “weakening” the commission’s independence by appointing “hand-picked” members whose jobs relied on state funding. 
“This Commission was formed to guard against the very Jim Crow tactics that are being used to hinder, delay, or destroy the rise and effectiveness of black leadership in the State of Nebraska,” Carter said in his resignation letter. 
Foley at the time urged state officials to consider taking back the roughly $13,000 paid to Carter while he was interim director. Whether Carter’s actions constituted a crime was up to law enforcement, he said, but to his knowledge no actions were taken against Carter since his resignation. 
Including Carter, the commission has had four executive directors in its four-year lifespan, each of which has served less than a year. The most recent director, Simone Smith, replaced Carter in August and resigned in April. 
Foley said it was this history of turnover that prompted the audit. He said it points to a pattern of infighting that likely contributed to the procedural violations exposed in the report. 
What’s in the audit
In addition to reviewing the concerns with Carter’s appointment, the audit alleges multiple violations of the Open Meetings Act — most over how commission meetings were recorded — and several expenses that either were not adequately documented or otherwise failed to follow proper procedure. 
The audit tracked 10 commission meetings from October 2022 through July 2024. For many of these meetings, Foley alleged the minutes kept were insufficient. Eight out of 10 failed to share the location of the meetings, and nine of 10 did not properly disclose details about closed sessions. 
In at least one instance, Foley claimed the commission met without an official quorum, conducting business with just seven of its 12 members present. State statute dictates that a quorum for the commission is made up by a minimum of eight members, Foley said. 
The audit also alleged that the commission occasionally conducted business via email, including taking votes through email, in violation of law. In one 2023 example, Foley reports that commissioners voted by email to hire Zelle Inc. as a recruitment service to find candidates to fill the vacant executive director position. 
Foley outlined dozens of other expenses that the audit questioned. Most raised concerns over how the purchases were documented. The largest single expense was the hiring of Zelle Inc. for $7,500. 
Foley acknowledged that the financial concerns in the audit were not of “enormous significance,” going so far to say they represent “typical” errors found in state agencies. What’s less normal is the continued pattern of errors spanning multiple years. 
Foley said he was encouraged by how seriously commissioners took their response to the draft audit he sent them before the report went public. He said members were “meticulous” in their review. 
He also said he has no immediate plans to keep monitoring the commission.
“I’m hoping that this report will kind of clear the air and set the tone for a new beginning for the agency,” Foley said. 
Members of the commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Cannabis Control Commission’s training program for those most impacted by the war on drugs is set to resume September 8 after a year-long delay the agency attributes to budget constraints. 
The post Cannabis social equity training program back on after a year-long pause  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION’S social equity program – which has been on pause for a year due to budget constraints – is back on track for the fall.  
Last year, the commission accepted 229 individuals into the cannabis industry training program for individuals most impacted by the war on drugs, but said that the agency didn’t have funding from the Legislature to operate the program as promised. The course is aimed at providing industry training, technical assistance around regulatory requirements, networking opportunities, and fee waivers for those impacted groups to make it easier for them to enter the industry as cannabis business owners or employees.  
Now, with pressure from advocates to get the program restarted, CCC leadership says it is now kicking off on September 8 with the current round of applicants and will accept more applicants starting August 1.  
The Legislature capped the agency’s budget at $19.88 million – about $10 million less than the commission’s $30 million budget ask for fiscal year 2026. This kicked off a back-and-forth between the commission’s leadership and lawmakers over whether the CCC is adequately funded to complete crucial IT infrastructure updates, hire for important positions, and conduct public awareness campaigns.  
Bruce Stebbins, the commission’s acting chair, said to CommonWealth Beacon after the commission’s public meeting on Thursday that he is excited for the social equity programming to begin again and that he is appreciative of the agency’s staff for working within the current budget to keep the process moving along. 
“They’ve understood the constraints of the level [of] funding that we’ve gotten over the last couple of years, and I think they’ve pivoted effectively,” said Stebbins. “They’re trying to make changes so that the program remains open to everybody and everybody has access to the program material.” 
The cohort that was accepted last summer was given access to virtual training on an online platform called TalentLMS, but didn’t receive the in-person instruction and networking opportunities that previous cohorts did. Starting in September, there will be updated courses on the platform and trainings offered through Zoom. The classes will be virtual in order to limit costs.  
Many accepted individuals have been waiting for the programming to begin in earnest for over a year, expressing open disappointment with the delays. 
“I understand the tensions around the budget and the fact that the Legislature has kept the commission on a pretty tight string, and that the commission has had to make tough choices, but it’s definitely frustrating to those who were really eager to get into the industry and looking at this as their pathway into it,” said Kevin Gilnack, deputy director of the cannabis advocacy group Equitable Opportunities Now, who was one of the applicants accepted in last year’s cohort. 
Gilnack – who was once arrested for cannabis possession – said he is eager to take the business- and cannabis industry-specific classes offered by the program, so he can figure out if there is a viable path for him to enter the competitive industry.  
Part of the pitch in the successful 2016 ballot measure for cannabis legalization in Massachusetts included assisting those harmed by the war on drugs to participate in the legal industry. The subsequent law legalizing cannabis and creating the CCC, passed by the Legislature in 2017, directs the commission to ensure full participation – still a somewhat ambiguous metric – in the industry by those disproportionately harmed by marijuana prohibition.  
The commission often touts its work as a nationwide model, in part because of its social equity training program. 
But the funding issues are not likely to resolve soon. Lawmakers have kept a critical eye on the turmoil and regulatory delays at the commission in the past two years. Issues include allegations of bullying at the agency, failure by the commission to collect over $500,000 in licensing fees, and long delays in major regulatory changes. The House passed a cannabis reform bill on June 4 that would restructure the commission to a three-member body appointed solely by the governor as a way of addressing some of the agency’s leadership issues. 
Gilnack’s group is advocating for a bill put forward by state Sen. Liz Miranda of Boston, who co-chairs the joint committee on racial equity, civil rights, and inclusion. The bill would automatically set aside funding from cannabis tax revenue to go towards the social equity program, even if the Legislature chooses not to fully fund the commission through its ordinary process and without considering how the commission chooses to allocate its budget. 
“I think the important thing is that we figure out a way to make sure that future social equity program participants aren’t held back by these funding challenges,” said Gilnack. “It would be great to see the Legislature actually set up automatic funding so that regardless of what else is going on, social equity will remain a priority that actually gets fulfilled every year.”

For I.M. Aiken, writing is a process that isn’t just about writing. It is also about speaking her vision and characters to life. As a author diagnosed early with dyslexia who struggled mightily discerning words/stories/information from those symbols we call letters on the page, “reading became joyful” for Aiken when she “started getting books-on-tape.” 
She says, “My first memory of an audio book is a record album set (LP) of EB White reading Charlotte’s Web. I would listen often. I also had a recording of the Velveteen Rabbit, but that was so sad.” 
Her collection of physical audio books is massive and includes a course on Shakespeare from the 1980s and copious amounts of fiction. “There are over thirty years of audiobooks in this house,” she reveals.
Harry Potter audiobook (tapes) in the cutest wooden boxes, made by IM Aiken.
After writing three Trowbridge Vermont novels in rapid succession—The Little Ambulance War (2024), Stolen Mountain (forthcoming, 2025), and Captain Henry (forthcoming, 2026)—IM Aiken has turned her pen to short stories—or as her publicist refers to them, “micro-masterpieces”—for The Trowbridge Dispatch (2025, 2026), offering readers a deeper, more intimate look at Vermont and the Vermonters who populate the novels. 
The main characters in Aiken’s work are ambulance drivers, first responders, rescue workers, military folks, people who have something to stand for, people who do for others, though always in a nonchalant, “this is just my job” sort of way that masks their discomfort, physical and emotional pain, and trauma, even if they manage to ask, “Who is rescuing we rescuers?” 
Given the love affair between Aiken and the audiobook, it’s only natural that she would want to offer that level of joy and access to her own readers. She records her own audiobooks for all her works. As effortlessly as the words seem to flow from her tongue, the amount of work that goes into recording one’s own audiobook might be surprising—from initial recording, to painstaking editing, to sending it off to a sound engineer for final polishing. Aiken has also recently revamped her sound studio with state-of-the-art equipment, which she is kind enough to describe for us:
“My studio is a niche in a dormer window draped with wool. To my left is my radio-voice mic (a Shure SM7B), in front of me is my laptop with the manuscript displayed, to my right is the small multi-channel recorder/mixer. I tend to fail with fidelity between my reading and the words I wrote. After recording, I adjust text and I adjust audio. I want to feel something when I read.” Aiken continues:
“Should I admit to embarrassment when I make myself laugh? I cannot read the final paragraphs of The Little Ambulance War without choking up—which I then later hear on the tape.
The first pass editing happens in my office where I have four monitors. Audio waves here, narrative there, annoying email being annoying. On the “tape”, I trim small mouth noises, and add silence. Yes,I add silence. Having now recorded two novels (twenty-six combined hours) and a dozen short stories, I must remember, the effort to record a book is likely treble the effort of simply reading silently.”
Aiken says that when she reads a work aloud in the recording process, speaking each character’s lines, a next level of magic happens, and the story more fully reveals itself in her sometimes deadpan, sometime intense emotion; hear her break into joyous song in the decadent, buttery “First Corn” (2025, Trowbridge Dispatch), or hear her voice break in pain with the ever-so-intimate “The Joker” (2025, Trowbridge Dispatch -13 minute audio/written short story at Amazon, Libro.FM and others). 
At once hilarious, gorgeous, honest, elegant, messy, comforting, visceral, painful, immaculate, much of Aiken’s work sticks close to Vermont, its land and roads and mountains and hills, its laws and its history, its traditions, its needs and wants—and gives it all the attention it deserves. (Yes, we can surely taste the maple syrup and breathe the piney air.) This becomes all the more a treat when read by Aiken in her ever-delightful brogue.
According to the American Audiobook Association, audiobooks were born in vinyl, in the spirit of accessibility, starting with the Talking Book Program, in the early 1930s, which saw test recordings (in vinyl) of works by Helen Keller and Edgar Allen Poe. This was followed by a steady climb in popularity and production, aligned with the emergence of new technologies, and we now spend billions a year on audiobooks, which have become a go-to format for people of all ages. We listen while we drive, jog, cook, play, work, workout, relax, and educate ourselves.
All that being said, we pass the mic back to Aiken:
“My last confession… I will listen to my own audiobooks and my own short stories. It is centering and soothing. Sometimes, I surprise myself with phrasing, emotions, or movement. That’s not supposed to happen is it?”
To fully experience Aiken’s works, even print lovers will be wise to read along with the audio book version—her wit, sardonic humor, deep love for humanity, and intense passion for life cannot be fully experienced without it. For those of you who live for your audiobooks, please put these on your list—your ears will thank you.

Forecasts anticipate further rains in the area, worrying local officials. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico Ryan Ellison Friday morning issued a message to Ruidoso residents to be on the lookout for fraud in the aftermath of this week’s catastrophic flooding.
In a news release, Ellison said the flooding, which took three lives and destroyed homes and businesses, had prompted “countless acts of generosity and resilience as neighbors, volunteers, and organizations step forward to help those in need.” However, historically natural disasters “like this also attract individuals seeking to exploit the situation for personal gain. Fraudulent activity undermines recovery efforts and diverts critical resources away from genuine victims.”
Those types of fraudulent activities include: fraudulent charities “or the diversion of donations intended for legitimate relief organizations”; fraudulent applications for grants and loans; “not affected by the flooding who attempt to claim disaster benefits,” the news release said.
Ellison said his office has “zero tolerance for those who seek to steal from disaster victims or misuse funds meant for recovery” and has established a disaster fraud working group with members from its office, the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service and several other federal agencies.
“This group is actively reviewing potential cases and will work closely with the New Mexico Department of Justice, local and tribal law enforcement, and community partners to ensure that fraudsters are brought to justice,” the release said.
The office also encouraged residents who observe suspicious or fraudulent behavior to contact the 24-hour National Disaster Fraud Hotline at (866) 720-5721, or you email disaster@leo.gov.
President Donald Trump on Thursday granted an emergency declaration for Chaves, Lincoln, Otero and Valencia counties, which authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency “to identify, mobilize and provide, at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency” at 75% federal funding.
The state’s congressional delegation subsequently sent Trump a letter urging him to issue a major disaster declaration, noting that the weather pattern that began June 23 has taken three lives, impacted approximately 675 homes, “with hundreds more under immediate threat of ongoing flooding in burn scars” and damaged “70 distinct pieces of critical infrastructure,” including roads and bridges; water control facilities; and at least eight public buildings.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ZAM0817-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-11 13:20:49.840125

The most important commandment in the Gospel is to love God and love those around you. 
 As a child, growing up in a small church in California, love was a message I received every time I went to church. I absorbed the message of the Good Samaritan, of the forgiveness of Zacchaeus, of Jesus’s outreach to the poor, the sick, and the outcast. I learned that God loved me, and that He called me to love everyone around me, to spread His love to all the peoples of the earth, and be a reflection of His light. I learned that all human beings are made in the image of God, and that we are all brothers and sisters in Christ.


 I do not see the love of God in contemporary politics, even (or especially) in the people who loudly proclaim their faith and use it to justify their beliefs. I do not see the Good Samaritan stopping on the side of the road to help a stranger in the person who ignores a homeless person begging for food to feed their family, and then votes against funding resources for them. I do not see Jesus feeding the hungry in the person who votes to cut resources to food banks, and restricts access to food stamps. I do not see Jesus reaching out to the leper, the outcast of society, in the person mocking individuals with disabilities. I do not see Jesus in cuts to programs for children, students, and volunteers seeking to give back to their communities that impact people across Connecticut.
 Of course, no Christian would claim perfection, “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). However, Jesus calls us, as Christians, to spread his love to everyone. Jesus spent time with prostitutes and outcasts, preached to the poor and condemned. Even as he died on the cross, he reached out with compassion to the criminals on either side of him. How does seizing someone from the streets for writing an opinion piece, or forbidding someone from witnessing the birth of their son for their political beliefs entail loving your neighbor? How does deporting an innocent man to a prison notorious for human rights violations spread the love of God?

 The Trump administration is vocal in its embrace of the Christian faith. Cabinet meetings beginning with prayers, impromptu hymn sing-a-longs breaking out in the White House. But Jesus doesn’t call on us to display our faith loudly, in fact he condemns the Pharisees for doing the same, saying “when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full” (Matthew 6:5).
In addressing those gathered during the National Prayer Breakfast on February 6, President Trump repeatedly extolled the value of religion, saying, among other things, that “People of religion are going to be happy again.”
I call on all Christians to look within themselves and see if that is really the case. Are you happy that someone found liable for sexual assault is our President? Are you happy that federal programs protecting the most vulnerable members of our society, including undocumented children, are being slashed? I know for certain that I am not.
In Connecticut, I do see the love of God in groups like the bipartisan End Homelessness Caucus, which formed in the state legislature in February. Part of their purpose is to prevent anti-homeless policies being passed in the state following the Supreme Court decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson (2024) allowing ordinances banning public camping, and to increase funding towards state resources for homeless individuals.
A famous sculpture by Timothy P. Schmalz that depicts Jesus as a homeless individual sleeping on a bench has been placed in locations across the world. I encountered it in Rome, in the neighborhood of Trastevere. I was with some friends, but I stopped for a moment, and thought about the life of Jesus. Jesus, above all, taught compassion for the downtrodden and outcast members of society. During the Last Judgement, he tells the righteous “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me” (Matthew 25:40). 
Near the end of his life, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech. It might not be as famous as some of the other speeches he made, but I think his “Beyond Vietnam” speech holds important lessons for us as Christians today. In it, he calls on Christians to love and support all of humankind, referencing 1 John 4:7-8: “Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.” 
In his letter to the Phillipians, Paul writes “In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus [who] … made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness” (Philippians 2:5-7). I don’t want to follow a God who encourages his followers to insulate themselves and harm innocent people. 
But a God who is love, and calls his followers to love others unconditionally? I could get behind that.

A new study sheds lights on the increasing loss of obstetric services across America. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.
Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
 

The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.

 
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.
“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).
Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

Phil Murphy signed legislation on Wednesday, July 9, 2025, to expand access to free preschool and full-day kindergarten in New Jersey. (Photo courtesy of Murphy administration)Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation this week that will expand free preschool in New Jersey, as well as full-day kindergarten to the few remaining districts that don’t yet offer it by 2030.
Early childhood education has been a Murphy priority, with his administration adding 20,000 new free preschool seats in 229 districts since he took office in 2018. Still, almost half of New Jersey’s school districts don’t have public preschool and 10 don’t have all-day kindergarten.
Legislation Murphy signed Wednesday mandates full-day kindergarten in all districts by 2030.
It also codifies the state’s preschool funding formula into statute and requires the state Department of Education to provide annual preschool expansion grants. It establishes a three-year preschool cost-sharing pilot program, creates a committee to guide preschool expansion, and requires state agencies to post preschool information on their websites and annually report on expansion efforts and preschool efficacy to legislators.
Another measure extends contract lengths for preschools to three years.

Murphy signed the bills at the Plainfield Early Learning Center, with state legislators and education officials at his side. The measures, he said, will help parents save on child care costs while ensuring children get more solid educational foundations that will set them up for lifelong success.
“With the steps we are taking today, we’re going to ensure that every parent in New Jersey will eventually be able to enroll their child in a high-quality pre-K program at no additional cost,” Murphy said. “The very future of our state, our economy, our workforce, our quality of life, you name it, hinges on the health, success and well-being of our children.”
New Jersey now spends $1.2 billion to create and sustain public preschool programs. Roughly 80,000 3- and 4-year-olds now are enrolled in free preschool around the state.
State Education Commissioner Kevin Dehmer noted that Plainfield was an Abbott district, required by courts in class-action litigation filed in 1981 to provide universal preschool to remedy longtime funding disparities between poor urban districts and their wealthier suburban peers.
“As a former Abbott district, Plainfield is where New Jersey’s state-funded preschool program began more than 25 years ago,” Dehmer said. “Since its inception, the Abbott preschool model has been a national benchmark because of its focus on quality, equity, and community partnership. Each year we’ve seen how this has had a lasting impact on our students, our families, and their communities.”
Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington), one of the bill sponsors, echoed that sentiment, calling universal free preschool “a game-changer.”
“We all know that the most important issue facing our state is affordability, and pre-K is going to make a huge difference in so many families’ lives,” Katz said.

,DC,2025-07-11 16:14:06+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Judge’s order blocking Planned Parenthood funding ban unlawful, Trump DOJ says",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judges-order-blocking-planned-parenthood-funding-ban-unlawful-trump-doj-says,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Justice asked a federal judge Friday to reverse course and allow the Trump administration to implement a provision in the “big, beautiful” law that prevents Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for one year.The request was filed just days after Judge Indira Talwani issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the federal government from implementing that section of the law while the case progresses.The Department of Justice’s motion asks Talwani to withdraw her prior order, arguing she didn’t follow procedure and should have given the government’s lawyers time to respond before ruling.“Enjoining an Act of Congress signed by the President of the United States is among the most serious and consequential exercises of the judicial power,” the DOJ filing states. “It must be exercised with caution and restraint, as the separation of powers counsels against one branch of government effectively seizing for itself the powers of the other two branches.“Yet here, without even awaiting a response from the Government, the Court exercised that power through an extraordinary, highly unusual temporary restraining order (TRO), preventing the enforcement of duly enacted legislation approved by Congress and signed by the President barely a week ago.”Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Monday, alleges the law violates the organization's equal protection and represents First Amendment retaliation.“The Defund Provision purposefully treats Planned Parenthood Members unlike other organizations that provide the same medical care,” the lawsuit states. “Others who provide abortion and also receive Medicaid payments for Medicaid-covered care are not similarly targeted by the Defund Provision and are not prohibited from receiving Medicaid funds as a result.”The filing contends that “unequal treatment burdens Planned Parenthood Members’ fundamental right to free association under the First Amendment.”Congress already bars federal taxpayer dollars from going to abortion, with limited exceptions. The new law would prevent Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood for other types of health care services, like annual physicals, birth control and cancer screenings.Planned Parenthood asked for the temporary restraining order shortly after filing the lawsuit Monday and Talwani, who was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama, issued it a few hours later.The Department of Justice wrote in its Friday brief the temporary restraining order should have never been entered.“As the Government’s forthcoming opposition will make plain, Plaintiffs’ claims are devoid of merit from start to finish,” the DOJ filing states. “Granting a high-stakes motion based on such empty legal theories cries out for explanation; indeed, everything about this case makes following the rules especially critical. But the Court did not follow them.”",,,,2025-07-11 12:25:52.348171

“Emergency response knows no borders, and we are dedicated to working alongside Texas to provide the necessary assistance and resources,” ADEM Director AJ Gary said in a statement. 
The Arkansas team will provide support in resource tracking, documentation, situational awareness and operational reporting, according to the release. They will also act as liaisons between Texas and assisting states.  
Their deployment is scheduled for an initial eight-day period, with team members working 12-hour shifts with state and federal partners. The mission may be extended as needed, the release states. 
The Arkansas National Guard sent 22 troops to Texas on Tuesday to assist with recovery efforts as well. Their mission was scheduled through Saturday, but could be extended. 
At least 120 people were killed and another 172 were still missing as of Friday morning, according to The Texas Tribune.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Forty-three hours after a man dressed as a police officer shot DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife at their home in Champlin, state patrol officers handcuffed the suspect in a field outside the rural community of Green Isle. 
Elected officials and law enforcement leaders commended police for the investigation that led to the the capture of the suspected shooter — alive — following the largest manhunt in state history. 
“To the law enforcement who stand here, and the hundreds who were involved in this, the state of Minnesota owes you a deep debt of gratitude. Thank you,” Gov. Tim Walz said at a press conference announcing the apprehension of the suspect. “You ran towards the danger, and you served the state of Minnesota.”
But law enforcement didn’t capture the suspect, Vance Boelter, in time to prevent the murders of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their dog Gilbert. 
And, while the suspect was on the loose, some elected officials wondered whether they were potential targets, left exposed without any protection. 
In the weeks since the Hortmans’ deaths, law enforcement leaders, elected officials and the Minnesotans they represent have questioned how the investigation and pursuit could have gone differently.
“It’s just unprecedented,” said Bob Jacobson, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. “It’s just one of those things that, you know…wasn’t necessarily in the playbook.”
Boelter is facing federal and state murder charges for the killings of the Hortmans, plus charges related to the attempted murder of the Hoffmans. Federal charges allege that after Boelter shot the Hoffmans, he went to two other Democratic state lawmakers’ homes before killing the Hortmans. 
One of those homes was empty — state Rep. Kristin Bahner of Maple Grove was on vacation with her family. Down the street from the home of Sen. Ann Rest in New Hope, a police officer going to check on the senator encountered Boelter, who was dressed like a police officer and sitting in a Ford Explorer decked out like a police vehicle. He fled after the officer unsuccessfully sought his attention before moving on to check on Rest.
Boelter was a Christian, according to his roommate and videos of his sermons posted online. He seems to have been motivated by an opposition to abortion and voted in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. His apparent targets were Democratic elected officials, abortion providers and abortion rights activists.
Some lawmakers wonder why they didn’t learn until hours after the shooting of the Hortmans that they were on the suspect’s “hit list” — while he was armed and on the loose. Others who lived close to the sites of the attacks want to know why they weren’t offered any protection.
Residents of north Minneapolis have questioned why they weren’t warned that the shooter had a home in their neighborhood and that he had traveled through the neighborhood in the hours after the attacks.
And law enforcement leaders are asking themselves, and each other, how they could have communicated better in the midst of the chaos.

Why did it take so long for police to check on the Hortmans? 
At 2:06 a.m., the Hoffmans’ daughter called 911 to report that her parents had been shot at their home in Champlin. Brooklyn Park police assisted Champlin officers in responding to the shooting.
As one Brooklyn Park police officer prepared to go home at the end of his shift, he suggested to his colleagues that they drive over to the Hortmans’ home to make sure they were safe. 
The officers arrived at around 3:30 a.m. — about an hour after a New Hope police officer went to check on Rest, and an hour and a half after the attack on the Hoffmans. 
Around 10 seconds after officers arrived, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said, they witnessed a man dressed as a police officer shoot Mark Hortman in the entryway. One Brooklyn Park officer fired at the shooter, who entered the home and later escaped.
Bruley said officers were busy providing aid to the Hoffmans and assisting with the shooting crime scene, which is why they didn’t get to the Hortmans sooner.
“Do I wish they were there three minutes earlier and potentially save Melissa and Mark’s life?” Bruley said. “Of course I do. But the truth was, it just wasn’t in the cards.”
State leaders have credited Brooklyn Park police with interrupting Boelter and forcing him to flee on foot, abandoning his imitation police car at the scene. According to the federal charges, police found five guns in the vehicle, including semi-automatic, assault-style rifles; loaded magazines; a storage unit bill with Boelter’s name on it; and several notebooks. 
  Images from the federal charging documents against Vance Boelter show weapons and other items inside of his car.
The notebooks were full of handwritten notes, including the names of more than four dozen Democratic Minnesota elected officials, some with home addresses listed next to the names. 
Bruley said he scanned the list for other lawmakers in his jurisdiction, then his staff emailed the list to Jacobson at approximately 6 a.m.
“I need everything you’ve got to try to get to these people on this list, because the suspect is not in custody,” Bruley recalled telling Jacobson.
Why were some lawmakers uninformed and unprotected for hours while the suspect was armed and on the loose?
The law enforcement effort to protect legislators, which was directed by a patchwork of state and local agencies, appears to have been inconsistent. Some lawmakers received immediate protection, while others waited nearly a full day to hear anything.
Anoka police were outside the home of Republican Sen. Jim Abeler by 3 a.m., he said. Rep. Danny Nadeau, R-Rogers, said he learned police had been protecting his home for hours by the time he woke up at 6 a.m.
Rep. Mike Freiberg, DFL-Golden Valley, and Sen. Bonnie Westlin, DFL-Plymouth, both praised their police departments.
“I don’t believe every legislator felt that they got the same level of support I did from the Golden Valley police, which is unfortunate,” Freiberg said. “I do think we need to make sure everyone feels secure.”
After Jacobson received the list of Boelter’s potential targets around 6 a.m., he sent it to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension’s Fusion Center with instructions to reach out to the people on the list. The Department of Public Safety also provided the list to local law enforcement agencies, Jacobson said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers had learned about the shootings via word-of-mouth and feared for their own safety, not knowing about the list or whether they were on it. Some local law enforcement agencies started sending patrol cars out to local lawmakers’ houses in the early hours of the morning, regardless of their status on the list. 
Rep. Huldah Momanyi-Hiltsley represents Brooklyn Park and lives within a few miles of the Hortmans’ home. She woke up early that Saturday morning and learned from colleagues that the Hortmans had been shot — and shortly after, that the suspect hadn’t been caught.
“Immediately I started freaking out, because I’m the closest to Speaker Hortman’s house, four minutes away,” Momanyi-Hiltsley said. “We don’t know if this monster was working alone. We didn’t know anything.”
She reached out to Bruley, but he was busy. With no information or directions from law enforcement, Momanyi-Hiltsley and her family fled their house as a precaution.
Bruley called Momanyi-Hiltsley back that evening to let her know she wasn’t on the list of names in the suspect’s notebooks. Momanyi-Hiltsley said she’s grateful for Brooklyn Park Police Department’s work, and that lawmakers should find a way to clarify who is responsible for their safety.
“I think that both realities can exist, where they did great, but also there were gaps that we are addressing right now as legislators and as a community,” Momanyi-Hiltsley said. “And unfortunately, I was just one of those legislators that fell through the cracks.”
During an interview nearly two weeks after the killings, Bruley said he wished he had contacted lawmakers who live in close proximity to the Hortmans, rather than only the ones he saw on the suspect’s list. But his department simply didn’t have the extra resources to stand watch outside lawmakers’ homes, he said.
In nearby Spring Lake Park, DFL Rep. Erin Koegel said she woke up around 7 a.m. Saturday to multiple voicemails, including some from law enforcement. Koegel was home alone for the weekend with her 13-year-old lab, Spud, while her husband, 6-year-old kid and their other dog were spending time at their cabin.
After talking with her local police chief, who offered to send extra patrols by her house, Koegel instead decided to hit the road. Her haste meant she left behind her medicine, which she later had to coordinate with police to collect from her house.
“I immediately knew I was going to leave,” Koegel said. “I didn’t want to be by myself, and dude (Boelter) was still on the loose. Melissa lives — lived — just across the river from me. I was worried that I was in too close of a proximity.”
Koegel didn’t learn that she was on Boelter’s list until around 9 p.m. Saturday, when the FBI called, she said.
Police in Apple Valley were not made aware that DFL Sen. Erin Maye Quade was on the list until around 9 a.m., about three hours after DPS received the list.
Some local law enforcement agencies, including the Minneapolis Police Department and the Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office, didn’t have ready access to elected officials’ addresses. In Minneapolis, officers scrambled to compile lawmakers’ addresses, then sent patrols out to the homes, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the Reformer.
By the time officers started knocking on elected officials’ doors, some had already fled, O’Hara said. 
Complicating the situation: Boelter had been impersonating a police officer. Some elected officials called their local police departments when a patrol car arrived, or when an officer knocked at their door, fearing it could be the assassin.

Who is in charge of lawmaker safety?
As elected officials sought information and protection, it wasn’t always clear who was responsible for their safety. 
The Minnesota State Patrol, under the DPS umbrella, is responsible for protecting lawmakers on the Capitol grounds, Jacobson said. The state patrol has a division responsible for protecting the governor and lieutenant governor at their residences — but not legislators.
Jacobson said the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms are responsible for communicating with lawmakers about their safety. In a message to DFL senators via a DFL senate staffer at 6:42 a.m. on June 14, Jacobson told the elected officials to check in with their local law enforcement agencies and to “alert them that there may have been threats made against you and please take precautions to stay safe.”
Lawmakers should reach out to their sergeant-at-arms for more information about the threats, Jacobson wrote.
The sergeants-at-arms did not respond to the Reformer’s interview requests. 
O’Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, said when someone makes a threat against a lawmaker, it’s generally the responsibility of the local police in the area where the threat originated to address the crime.
But there’s no consensus about this, apparently. A spokesperson for the St. Paul Police Department deferred the Reformer’s questions to the Minnesota State Patrol, “as they are ultimately responsible for the safety of our lawmakers.”
Throughout that Saturday’s chaos, Bruley said he didn’t know if there was a clear communications stream from the top down because he was overwhelmed with the manhunt. Lawmakers were frustrated with the lack of information provided, and by a midday check-in with the state’s chiefs and sheriffs, Bruley said local police departments were implementing their own protection strategy.
In a July 7 letter to the Chief Sergeant-at-arms for the House and captain of the State Patrol’s Capitol Security Division, Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher wrote that “many of the targeted legislators were left uninformed for several hours that danger lurked.”
He posed the following questions:
“Who, or which agency, is responsible to notify legislators quickly that they are potential victims of a violent criminal stalking them? 
“Who, or which agency, is responsible to notify law enforcement agencies in a timely fashion that legislators in their jurisdiction are in potential immediate danger?”
Why wasn’t north Minneapolis warned that the suspect had been in the area?
In the late morning of June 14, dozens of police officers from local, state and federal agencies descended on the Lind-Bohanon neighborhood in north Minneapolis, preparing to execute a search warrant at a house on Fremont Ave. where Boelter lived part-time. 
Lind-Bohanon and north Minneapolis are home to a large Black community. When the U.S. Department of Justice investigated the Minneapolis Police Department in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, investigators found that the department routinely discriminated against Black and Native American residents and violated their constitutional rights. 
When Minneapolis police joined the other agencies in executing the search warrant, officers knew that Boelter had been at the house earlier in the day — his roommate had called 911 that morning. While police believed that Boelter had left the house, they did not have confirmation that he had left the area, O’Hara said.
Children were playing outside that day, unaware that an armed suspect had been nearby, the Star Tribune reported.
Some neighbors questioned why Minneapolis police did not issue a shelter-in-place warning, when Brooklyn Park police had done so earlier in the day.
“What happened on June 14 is a symptom of much deeper issues in how north Minneapolis is treated. We need transparency, accountability and community-centered response, not silence when our lives are on the line,” said Marvina Haynes, a candidate for the Minneapolis City Council ward representing Lind-Bohanon and other parts of north Minneapolis.
O’Hara said the reason for not issuing a shelter-in-place order was that the department “did not have the information to define where he might be at that point.”
Law enforcement officers entered a woman’s home across the street from Boelter’s house as they prepared to execute the search warrant.
“(An officer) said, ‘We need to get in your house now’ and I’m just like, ‘Huh? You need to get in my house?'” the woman told KARE 11. “They go in my room and they have big bags with them. They lay every gun out on the bed.”

  BROOKLYN PARK, MINNESOTA – JUNE 15: Windows are seen broken at the home of DFL State Rep. Melissa Hortman on June 15, 2025 in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.

Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting “appears to be a politically motivated assassination.” (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)
Why did police walk back their story of a shootout with the suspect?
In initial news reports and press conferences regarding the attacks, Bruley said that a Brooklyn Park police officer exchanged gunfire with the suspect at the Hortmans’ house. That’s no longer part of the official narrative of events.
Bruley attributed the change to uncertainty about Boelter’s actions — he may not have been shooting at the Brooklyn Park officers, but a member of the Hortman family instead.
The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating the use-of-force incident, as is standard practice. Bruley said he doesn’t know how many rounds the officer fired, but it is “extremely unlikely” that a Brooklyn Park officer accidentally shot the Hortmans. 
Bruley said his department and other law enforcement officials will find a third-party investigator to compile an after-action report to learn what could have been done better.
Though limited in what he could say by the ongoing investigation, Bruley recounted the body camera footage of the incident and said the officers did not enter the Hortmans’ house, as doing so would have gone against their deescalation training, he said. He also noted the scrutiny behind officer-involved shootings in Minnesota.
“There’s no way you can do something of this magnitude for the first time and think you’re gonna get it right,” Bruley said. 
A New Hope police officer drove to Rest’s home around 2:30 a.m. and encountered Boelter down the street in his imitation police car, apparently wearing a mask. But Boelter remained in his car and ignored the officer, who pulled up to Rest’s house. Boelter drove away, and allegedly shot the Hortmans around an hour later.

Jerry Moran of Kansas urges sustained military support for defense of Ukraine or risk further Russian aggression in Europe.,"U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, affirms support for U.S. military aid to Ukraine  in the third year of a war initiated by Russia because failure to deter President Vladimir Putin can have ramifications for NATO and U.S. military commitments to Europe. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas emphasized in a speech the importance of sustained support for Ukraine in the battle against Russia’s invasion and praised President Donald Trump’s commitment to resume weapon shipments authorized by Congress.
Moran, a Republican, said Trump would rely on authority granted the administration to oppose aggression of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who dramatically escalated conflict in Ukraine during 2022. This week, Trump said Russian forces were violating human rights and Ukraine needed arms such as the Patriot air defense missile.
“This commitment is vital, ensuring that Ukraine has the capabilities it needs to protect its people and its territory against ongoing aggression,” Moran said. “If we allow a dictator to redraw borders by force, then what message does that send to other authoritarian regimes watching closely around the globe, including China? It sends a message of weakness, it invites further aggression and it threatens our allies and partners around the globe.”
In a speech on the floor of the Senate this week, Moran said the cost of inaction by the United States would far outweigh the cost of action.
“If Putin is not stopped in Ukraine, the likelihood of a direct confrontation between Russia and a NATO ally dramatically increases. That would mean a far greater cost, not just in resources, but potentially in American lives,” the Kansas senator said.
On Thursday, Trump said U.S. weapons would be transferred to NATO for delivery to Ukraine. The military alliance would pay the brunt of the cost.
“We need to make certain Ukraine has the equipment necessary to win a just and lasting peace,” Moran said. “We are interested in that peace. We want that peace.”
Moran said one goal should be to strengthen domestic defense production capabilities to “ensure that we have a resilient industrial base with the ability to handle all the possible threats the United States faces now and into the future.”
He said 90% of aid delivered to Ukraine would create jobs and bolster defense manufacturing in the United States.
“By aiding Ukraine, we are replenishing our own stockpiles with new, more advanced equipment and demonstrating American leadership on the global stage,” Moran said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jerry-Moran-in-Senate-1024x520.png,,,2025-07-11 12:25:52.348171

(Stock photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)The costs of Sundi Herring’s breast cancer started adding up before she was even diagnosed.
After her doctor spotted a suspicious spot during an annual mammogram, Herring needed three needle biopsies, two MRIs and two sonograms to determine the spot was a cancerous tumor. Her insurance fully covered the initial mammogram, but for the rest, she paid thousands of dollars out of pocket.
“You just don’t know what you’re going up against,” the 49-year-old said.
A bipartisan bill introduced at the Statehouse this year would require private insurers to cover the cost of follow-up diagnostic tests if doctors have concerns. Federal law already requires most insurers to pay the entire cost of annual mammograms for women over 40. But that requirement refers only to the initial visit — not any additional steps needed to diagnose or rule out cancer.
The bill would also require insurers cover tests for women who need more examinations because of a family history of breast cancer or dense breast tissue, which can increase cancer risk and make tumors harder to detect.
Those follow-up tests are essential to catch cancer early, potentially saving lives, said Beth Johnson, a lobbyist for the state Cancer Action Network.
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in South Carolina, with more than 22,000 cases diagnosed between 2017 and 2021, according to the most recent data from the Department of Public Health.
But many insurance companies don’t cover the full cost of diagnostics, leaving some women deciding whether to skip follow-up appointments or cover costs that could range from hundreds to thousands of dollars, Johnson said.
“Then you’re stuck in the position of, ‘How do I pay for this? What’s my portion of it? Where do I go?’” Johnson said.
Herring, who lives in North Charleston, was strict about getting regular mammograms, since her grandmother, mother and aunt had all battled breast cancer. Her sister, however, skipped several years after spending $1,300 for diagnostic tests to determine a suspicious lump was benign.
That’s the case for many women, Johnson said.
An estimated 378,000 women skipped their regular screening last year because of the associated costs, according to a study commissioned by the American Cancer Society.
In recent years, with Herring’s persuading, her sister has started regular screenings again. She’s still not sure how she’ll handle the costs if doctors again raise concerns.
“We’re just taking care of each other the best that we can through this,” Herring said.
Out-of-pocket costs
Facing a cancer diagnosis, Herring was already worrying about whether she would have a future with her children. With costs that amounted to more than $5,000 for diagnostics alone, she also worried about her family’s economic future, she said.
Would she and her husband still be able to help put their children through college, as they had planned? Would they have to give up family vacations? Would their children have to quit expensive after-school activities?
Herring had long prided herself on providing for her family. With her diagnosis came a shift in identity as she began to see herself instead as a financial burden on her loved ones, she said.
“That was the darkest curtain that fell,” said Herring, the American Cancer Society’s director of philanthropy for North and South Carolina.
Because Herring’s cancer required so many different tests to diagnose, and because her insurance didn’t cover much of that testing, what she paid was more than most. In 2023, patients paid an average of $170 out of pocket for follow-up tests, according to the American Cancer Society study.
The cost varies depending on a patient’s insurance coverage and what tests they need. An ultrasound, for instance, cost patients an average of $108 out of pocket, while a biopsy cost an average of $447, according to the study.
The uncertainty is part of the problem, Johnson said.
If a patient doesn’t know how much they might have to pay, they might avoid preventative screenings altogether. Eliminating the cost would ease that burden, she said.
Scared of facing the price if doctors found cancer in her other breast, Herring found a surgeon willing to perform a double mastectomy despite only having cancerous tumors in one breast, she said.
Still, doctors found a lump in Herring’s remaining breast tissue in December of last year. She spent another $400 to determine the lump was benign, while also trying to buy her children Christmas presents, she said.
“It was such a winding mental road, thinking about the finances, thinking about the hurdles,” Herring said. “I just locked in on, ‘I’ve got to do this. I don’t have a choice.’”
A potential solution
Rep. Sylleste Davis, who sponsored the bill, said she’s been fortunate enough to never have a cancer scare that led to follow-up tests after a breast cancer screening. So, when she learned some insurance companies don’t cover the full cost of those tests, she was shocked, she said.
“I’ve never quite thought through, ‘Well, what happens if you do find issues from your initial mammogram?’” the Moncks Corner Republican said. “What steps are taken after that, and who pays for it?”
The bill, pre-filed in December, didn’t get a committee hearing in the session that ended in May.
Davis is chairwoman of the House medical committee, but her bill was sent instead to the Labor Commerce and Industry Committee for review because it affects insurance.
She plans to make it one of her top priorities when legislators return in January, she said. She has bipartisan support from a dozen co-sponsors.
If the bill passed, South Carolina would join 26 states that require private insurance companies cover costs for tests beyond an initial mammogram, according to nonprofit FORCE, which focuses on supporting families with hereditary cancer.
Patients diagnosed with cancer would still have to pay the cost of their treatments. The average hospital stay for people battling breast cancer costs more than $120,000, without accounting for medications and other at-home costs, according to the state Department of Public Health.
For women facing the prospect of an expensive and taxing medical treatment, not starting out thousands of dollars in debt could make a big difference, Herring said.
“This would allow a pathway to at least know that you have that underpinning so that you can get through the series of tests that you may need to find out what’s really happening with your body,” Herring said.
That’s important not only for Herring but for her 14-year-old daughter, who asks her mother whether she’ll one day develop breast cancer, too.
“I just say, ‘I can’t tell you yes and I can’t tell you no,’” Herring said. “‘All I can tell you is that we are working so hard to make sure that it doesn’t happen, but if it does, there will be resources there for you.’”

(File photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A long expected shift in New England electricity consumption – from using less power each year to consuming more as residents embrace electric vehicles and heat pumps – is beginning to happen, but the shift isn’t expected to be quite as dramatic as forecasters were predicting just a year ago.
The operator of the New England power grid released a study on Thursday saying a 10-year downturn in consumption of electricity from the region’s generating plants is coming to an end and giving way to the need for more electricity production over the next decade.
A year ago, ISO New England forecast a 17% increase in consumption of electricity generated by the region’s power plants by 2033. The latest report, citing a slowdown in electric vehicle and electric heat pump adoption rates, pares back the increase to 11% by 2034.
The shift is still fairly dramatic. According to the grid operator, electricity consumption steadily increased between 1995 and 2005, as the region experienced economic growth and New Englanders installed air conditioning in their homes and businesses. That trend reversed after 2005 as many residents reduced their consumption of electricity from power plants by embracing energy efficiency measures and by meeting all or some of their own power needs by installing solar panels.
Energy efficiency and home-grown solar production are continuing. Overall, solar power production in New England is forecasted to grow 88% over the next decade to 14,343 megawatts. Massachusetts is the leader, expected to generate 6,952 megawatts by 2034.
Still, ISO New England predicts the growth in solar and energy savings from efficiency measures will not be enough to offset the forecasted increased demand for electricity to power vehicles and home heating systems. The regional grid operator is forecasting that the electrification of the transportation and heating sectors will boost summer peak demand by 68 megawatts in 2025 and 956 megawatts by 2034. Peak demand during the winter heating season is expected to rise by 300 megawatts in 2025 and 6,529 megawatts by 2034.
Those increases are being predicted even though the Trump administration in Washington is pulling back support for electric vehicle, heat pump, and solar power subsidies.
The New England grid operator is forecasting that “net” electricity use – which is defined as electricity imported into the region or generated locally but not including solar home installations – will hit 130,665 gigawatt hours by 2034. That’s up from 116,813 gigawatt hours in 2024 and below the 2005 peak of 136,425 gigawatt hours.
ISO New England is not currently sounding alarms about its ability to secure enough electricity to meet future demand growth. A spokeswoman for the grid operator said it is currently counting on the construction of two offshore wind farms – Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts and Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island. Both wind farms are currently under construction and haven’t been blocked by the Trump administration, which opposes the development of offshore wind.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Nebraska Examiner)President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states. North Carolina stands to lose the seventh highest total of jobs at 188,000 — 82,000 of which would effect U.S.-born workers.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

The man, whom authorities identified as David Franklin Slater, 64, of Nebraska, had access to classified and “top secret” information as a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel working in the defense industry.
He worked from August 2021 to April 2022 at StratCom, essentially the command and control center for nuclear and conventional strategic deterrence of attacks against the U.S. and its international allies.
Much of the information discussed in the spaces at Nebraska’s Offutt Air Force Base, where he had access, was considered “secret.” His alleged coconspirator told him she was a woman living in Ukraine.

Court documents indicate he was pumped for information by the woman about NATO plans to help Ukraine during its war with Russia and shared info about military targets and Russian military capabilities.
In correspondence included in the court file, the woman called him “my secret agent” and referred to him as her “secret informant love.” She thanked him for sharing the information, which he later admitted he had.
At one point, the two exchanged messages about Americans traveling to Ukraine, knowledge that could have made them targets of foreign espionage or put them at risk of potential military operations.
“The Department of Justice stands ready to hold accountable those who violate their obligation to protect sensitive national security information,” said John A. Eisenberg, an assistant U.S. attorney general, said in a statement.

Eugene Kowel, the special agent in charge of the Omaha FBI Field Office, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Nebraska Lesley Woods said Slater should have known better, given his years of military experience.
The FBI and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations investigated the case, according to a news release from the Nebraska U.S. Attorney’s Office in Omaha.  
“Mr. Slater betrayed an oath he made to safeguard our nation’s intelligence,” Kowel said. “Leveraging his access to sensitive information, Mr. Slater chose to transmit material that put our country at risk.”
Slater faces up to 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine. He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 8. Prosecutors dropped two charges alleging disclosure of national defense info in exchange for his plea.

The appropriations were already approved by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump.
But the administration informed states that they would be withholding the funding for five programs that support educator development, student enrichment programs, migrant education, English learners and 21st-century learning centers.
While data isn’t available for the program supporting migrant education, federal data organized by New America shows that Michigan stands to lose $81.6 million across the other four programs – accounting for more than $65 per student in the state.
The deepest cuts are in areas represented in Congress by Democrats, with those school districts facing a loss of $45 million compared to nearly $36.6 million in areas represented by a Republican.
That’s an average of $7.5 million per school district in Democratic areas compared to $5.2 million per district in Republican areas.


Michigan’s seven Republican members of Congress represent 713,666 students, while the six Democrats in Michigan’s congressional delegation represent 530,785 students.
On average, school districts represented by a Democrat would lose about $84 per student, while school districts represented by Republicans would lose about $51 per student.
That’s a reversal from the national trend, where the average school district represented by a Republican would lose 1.6 times as much funding per pupil than those represented by a Democrat.
That’s in part because while 91 of the 100 school districts nationwide facing the deepest cuts are in Republican congressional districts, Detroit is one of the ten districts with the most funding at risk.


They would lose the third most funding nationwide for student support and enrichment programs and the sixth most funding for education development.
In total, the district has more than $16 million on the line.
U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Detroit) represents the hardest hit congressional district, which stands to lose about $210 per student, followed by U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) at about $87 per pupil.
The school district has the highest poverty rate across the 46 states for which data was available at 46.9%.
Detroit Public Schools Superintendent Nikolai Vitti could not be reached for comment.



Zahava Stadler is the project director of the Education Funding Equity Initiative in the Education Policy Program at New America.
She told Michigan Advance that highly impoverished districts are likely to face significant cuts since poverty rates are a consideration for some federal grants.
 “Higher poverty districts are going to be hit again and again and again as the federal government dithers over whether or not to release all of these individual funding streams to which school districts are legally entitled,” Stadler said.
The federal government withholding the already-allocated funding has made it even more difficult for schools to plan their budgets after the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives failed to pass a budget by their deadline of July 1.
Even if school districts are able to maintain the programs through other funding sources, Stadler said they wouldn’t be able to then reimburse those funds later on if the federal funds came through.
“Money can’t just get moved around at will,” Stadler said. “Federal dollars have rules. And the administration is throwing districts into chaos as they are rapidly approaching a new school year.”
Beyond the programs themselves having an impact on students, Stadler said the fight over funding also symbolizes the wrong message for the students who benefit from them.
“The message that these kids are getting is that their country doesn’t want to invest in them, their schools aren’t able to invest in them,” Stadler said. “And that is a really difficult and tragic thing to hear as a young person who is just trying to grow and thrive in a community of which they’re a member.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-11 15:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Mississippi, where ‘We Dissent’ means nothing to elected officials",Adam Ganucheau,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/11/congress-republicans-we-dissent/,Column: Thousands of Mississippians spent months imploring our congressional Republicans to consider the broad and harmful consequences of passing President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.” They didn’t listen.,"Cindy Hyde-Smith did not appear to enjoy being approached in late April by voters who were concerned about reports that President Donald Trump’s administration was pushing to slash federal Medicaid spending.
“Medicaid is not going anywhere,” the U.S. senator assured a group of three constituents at a Ridgeland Chamber of Commerce event in April before being ushered away by a staffer, according to people who witnessed the exchange. “Nothing is going to happen to Medicaid. Why is everyone’s head exploding? I can’t understand why everyone’s head is exploding.”
Fast-forward two months, and Hyde-Smith gleefully voted to do exactly what she had so quickly dismissed that day: cut Medicaid funding.
In Washington, shielded by the Beltway and a perceived security blanket of Trump’s MAGA acolytes, Hyde-Smith and the other four Mississippi congressional Republicans in Congress gloated about their votes.
Back home in Mississippi, however, many heads did indeed explode — and with good reason.
Because of Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” that every state delegate except Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson voted to pass, an estimated tens of thousands of Mississippians will lose Medicaid coverage and rural hospitals will lose millions annually in federal funding. While wealthy individuals and corporations will see sizable tax cuts under the legislation, most Mississippians will barely benefit. The bill strips away much of the nation’s safety net for our poorest residents — of which there are obviously many in our poorest state in the nation — and it will add an estimated $3 trillion to our national debt.
For the thousands of Mississippians who had spent weeks trying to relay the long list of negative consequences of the bill to their Washington delegation, final passage felt like a punch to the gut.
It’s a tale as old as time in Mississippi: voters of any and all political persuasions were ignored by their Washington representatives. Mississippi’s congressional representatives have long been out of touch with their constituents once we send them to the halls of the U.S. Capitol, but their avoidance this time felt especially pronounced as valid concern after valid concern was raised about the bill. Their sustained promises to not cut Medicaid, to not significantly raise the national debt and to take good care of people in their home state were not remotely kept here.
If you’re an everyday Mississippi citizen and you want to lodge concerns to your congressional delegation, good luck. Unless you’re deemed important enough to land on their Washington office schedule, you’ll need to get creative. You can call their D.C. or district offices, but you’ll either be directed to a voicemail box or talk briefly with an intern or other low-level staffer whose mandate is to take some notes and move on.
Over the past few months, there has been a loosely coordinated statewide effort to get the attention of those leaders. Thousands of Mississippians took part.

They called. They emailed. They protested outside district offices. They rallied in front of the state Capitol and courthouses. They sent letters, knocked on doors and jammed phone lines. They followed our senators and representatives to luncheons and business forums. They told them — over and over — that they were afraid about the real harm the “Big Beautiful Bill” would do to health care access in one of the sickest, poorest states in America.
In many cases, though, their cries were likely never heard at all by the elected officials.
On June 30, the day before the Senate passed the bill, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker’s Washington office was not accepting calls or even messages from constituents because “the voicemail inbox was full.” Five days earlier on June 25, an automated phone message at Wicker’s D.C. office said, “Calls to this number have been suspended.”
On July 3, the day of the final House vote to pass the bill, Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest’s D.C. office phone line had a busy signal most of the day. When a group of about a dozen people showed up to Guest’s district office in Brandon on July 3, the doors were locked and a sign was taped to the door with a number to call. An organizer of the protest called the number and spoke for a few minutes by phone with a Guest staffer, who some attendees believed to be inside the Brandon office all along.
Since February, groups of Mississippi constituents made three trips to Wicker’s Jackson office and three trips to Hyde-Smith’s Jackson office. Each time, they were either locked out of the offices or granted just a few minutes with staffers inside who worked to downplay their concerns.
So why, exactly, do our elected officials feel so confident ignoring the will of so many constituents or transparently voting against our state’s interests?
There’s certainly a long conversation to have about how special interest groups, led by the uber-wealthy who have never stepped foot in Mississippi, have commandeered our representative democracy. There’s even more to say about how our nation’s shadowy campaign finance regulations, successful efforts to gerrymander congressional districts and a slew of shady election laws allow D.C. incumbents to cling to power.
But in this instance, the answer could be a lot less about our government systems and a lot more about what’s right in front of us.
“They’re more afraid of Trump than they are of their own constituents,” surmised Kathleen O’Beirne, one of the people who confronted Hyde-Smith about the Medicaid cuts back in April. “Looking specifically at their votes on Medicaid, it sure seems like their disdain and hatred for poor people and people of color is stronger than their love for Mississippi. There’s no other explanation, especially if you understand how health insurance works. And I’d assume and hope they all do.”
O’Beirne, a retired attorney and mother of two in Ridgeland, has helped organize nine Mississippi rallies since February. She’s emerged as a leader for thousands of Mississippians who are feeling more than overlooked or slighted right now by our elected officials.
“It’s definitely frustrating at times,” she acknowledged of not being able to get through to congressional leaders. “But we aren’t going to stop. We’re not easily deterred. We’re seeing what’s happening, and we’re adding more Mississippians who are tired of this. If they (members of the congressional delegation) aren’t going to listen, we’re making it our job to be a thorn in their sides.”
As the negative effects of the legislation will become clearer in Mississippi over the next few months and years, it’s worth closely observing whether our state’s congressional delegation starts feeling a prick from that thorn. For now, they don’t seem to notice it.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/21135136/Advocates-speak-out-1.jpg,,,2025-07-11 11:24:02.608448

About 44% of recipients work full time and 29% work part time.,"The number of people receiving Medicaid in Connecticut has grown sharply over the last decade.
In Connecticut, Medicaid operates under the name HUSKY and insures about one-quarter of the state’s population.
The number of people served through any Medicaid-funded coverage steadily grew over the last decade, rising 61% from 2012 to 2023.
In 2024, total enrollment decreased 6%. HUSKY A, for low-income children, caregivers and pregnant women, has the largest number of people served, with about 606,000 enrollees this year. This is about 43% of all Medicaid members in the state. HUSKY D, which covers adults 19-64 without dependent children who don’t get Medicare, had the most growth over time, increasing 202% from 132,000 people in 2012 to 397,000 in 2024.
According to KFF, the majority of adults enrolled in Medicaid programs in Connecticut are working. About 44% work full time and 29% work part time. Of all Medicaid enrollees in Connecticut, about 30% are children, 4% live in a rural area and 17% have three or more chronic conditions, according to a May report from KFF. According to census data, less than 2% of the people in CT are noncitizens receiving public health insurance coverage.
Connecticut is projected to spend $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year, with the federal share accounting for 59% of that.
When it comes to the average annual Medicaid cost of covering one beneficiary, Connecticut spends less money than its neighboring states and less than the national average. 
In 2022, the latest data publicly available, the national average was $9,108 per person. Connecticut spent about $8,289 per person, less than Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-09-at-1.34.50 PM-1024x495.png,,,2025-07-11 11:24:02.608448

Gov. Maura Healey immediately appointed Dr. Kiame Mahaniah, who for nearly Walsh’s entire time in office has served as undersecretary of health, to take over the Executive Office of Health and Human Services’s top job starting Monday.
Mahaniah steps into the role on a permanent — not interim — basis at a critical point as Massachusetts braces for significant funding cuts and enrollment changes at MassHealth stemming from a new federal law.
“Dr. Mahaniah has an outstanding record as a physician, a community leader, and a valued member of the EOHHS leadership team,” Healey said in a statement. “As the Trump Administration undermines health care and food access for hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents, Dr. Mahaniah will be committed to making high-quality health care more affordable and accessible for all of our residents, bringing an urgently needed focus on primary care and behavioral health care, and maintaining our nation-leading health and human services system in Massachusetts.”
Walsh decided to step down for personal reasons after more than four decades of leadership in the health care sector, according to an official, and she will remain involved as an advisor to the Healey administration.
She oversaw the largest department in state government, whose work reaches across MassHealth, the opioid epidemic, child welfare and more. It’s also the single largest area of state spending, and arguably serves the most constituents of any executive office.

The move is part of a broad effort to limit access to federal benefits for immigrants who lack legal status.
People in the country illegally are largely ineligible for federal public benefits such as food stamps, student loans and financial aid for higher education. But for decades they have been able to access some community-level programs such as Head Start and community health centers.
HHS said it will reclassify those programs as federal public benefits, excluding immigrants in the country illegally from accessing them. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the changes were part of a larger effort to protect American citizens’ interests.
“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” Kennedy said in a statement. “Today’s action changes that — it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.”
A spokesperson for the Administration for Children and Families, which administers Head Start, said that eligibility will be determined based on the child’s immigration status.
Requiring proof of immigration status would likely create fear and confusion among families seeking to enroll their children, said Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association.
“This decision undermines the fundamental commitment that the country has made to children and disregards decades of evidence that Head Start is essential to our collective future,” Vinci said.

The changes are part of a multi-agency announcement rescinding an interpretation of federal law dating to former President Bill Clinton’s administration, which had allowed immigrants in the country illegally to access some programs. The Education Department, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labor announced similar changes affecting a range of workforce development and adult education programs.
The changes will affect community health centers that immigrants rely on for a wide range of services, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president of immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
“People depend on those services to get cancer treatment, to get ongoing maintenance for a variety of different health needs,” she said.
Students in the country illegally will no longer be eligible to participate in postsecondary career and technical education programs or adult education programs, the Education Department announced. The department also issued a notice to grant recipients to ensure programs receiving federal money do not provide services to immigrants without legal status.
Education advocates said the decision would harm young people who have grown up in this country. EdTrust Vice President Augustus Mays said the intention appears to be creating fear among immigrant communities.
“Policies like this don’t exist in a vacuum,” Mays said. “They are rooted in a political agenda that scapegoats immigrants and uses fear to strip rights and resources from the most vulnerable among us.”
Head Start was started six decades ago as part of Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty. It operates in all 50 states, providing preschool, developmental therapy and child care for families who are homeless or are in poverty.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dims.apnews-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-07-11 11:24:02.608448

The money collected will go toward anti-addiction programs.,"Connecticut and New York are part of a multi-state, $720 million settlement with eight drug manufacturers. Officials say the money collected will go toward anti-addiction programs.
Connecticut could get up to $8.4 million, and New York could get up to $38.7 million.
Attorney General William Tong (D-CT) said the companies have massively contributed to the opioid crisis in America. They are Mylan (now part of Viatris), Hikma, Amneal, Apotex, Indivior, Sun, Alvogen and Zydus.
“They knew that these drugs were highly addictive,” Tong said. “They knew that their products were being overprescribed, oversold, that communities that received their products were generating, receiving much more opioids than these communities could ever hope to consume.”
Payments are expected to begin as early as 2026. To date, Connecticut has used the money for mobile opioid treatment vans, housing programs, harm reduction, and more.
The overdose death rate in Connecticut declined 26% last year.
Seven of the companies involved in the settlement will be banned from promoting or marketing opioid products and making or selling any product with more than 40 mg of oxycodone per pill. They will also have to monitor and report suspicious orders.
So far, Connecticut has been awarded $600 million from opioid manufacturer settlements, while New York has received $3 billion.
“For years, drug companies prioritized profits at the expense of struggling New Yorkers who became trapped in deadly opioid addictions,” New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) said. “While communities throughout our state continue to suffer from the opioid crisis, these resources will help us begin to heal.”

(KCTCS photo)A new scholarship for Kentucky Community and Technical College students is aimed at preventing damage to utility lines.
The Kentucky Public Service Commission is providing a $66,000 annual fund to support training in how to safely locate and manage underground utility lines.
​​The PSC 811 Damage Prevention Scholarship will support training in three programs — construction technology, heavy equipment operations and plumbing technology — at 10 community and technical colleges, according to a KCTCS news release.
The 811 Damage Prevention program, commonly known as the “Call Before You Dig” program, encourages people to call 811 before digging to be sure underground utility lines are not in the way.
Public Service Commission chair Angie Hatton said damaged utility lines “interrupt vital services, damage property, and, in the case of gas and electric lines, can even cause injury or death. Despite ongoing efforts to promote the use of 811, dig-ins continue to happen.
“ That’s why we partnered with KCTCS to sponsor these scholarships — to better educate the future workforce that will be responsible for working around underground utilities.”
The PSC’s funding will support $2,000 scholarships during the 2025-26 academic year. The funds may be used for tuition, course fees, books, supplies and other education-related expenses, as approved by KCTCS. Scholarships are not automatically renewable, but previous recipients may reapply and be considered for future awards.
To qualify, students must have unmet financial need as determined by the FAFSA and be credential seeking with a minimum 2.0 GPA. Preference will be given to Kentucky residents enrolled full time or planning to enroll full time.

Sewer projects this year became eligible for public financing from the New Mexico Finance Authority's Water Project Fund. (Courtesy Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority)The organization that represents all 106 incorporated cities and towns across New Mexico wants state lawmakers to speed up the process the state government uses to approve drinking water and sewage infrastructure projects.
The state Water Trust Board makes loans and grants using the Water Project Fund.
The nonprofit New Mexico Municipal League is asking lawmakers to consider temporarily suspending the legal requirement that Water Project Fund plans receive their approval during legislative sessions, which only occur once per year.
The board evaluates drinking water project applications by the end of October each year; however, the league argues this legislative bottleneck means money isn’t released to local communities until the following March or April.
This has led to increased costs, the league says, including inflation, supply chain constraints and communities missing construction windows.
“The smaller the water system, the more difficult this process is,” said Marquita Russel, chief executive officer of the New Mexico Finance Authority, the state agency that oversees financing of public infrastructure projects.
The league wants lawmakers to allow NMFA to directly approve eligible Water Project Fund plans for three years, which it says would allow for money to be delivered more quickly and for projects to have better outcomes.
Even though the amount of public money going into the Water Project Fund has dramatically increased over the past six years in line with growing revenues from oil and gas extraction, local communities’ applications for funding have still exceeded the fund’s total amount, legislative analysts reported in May. In the most recent session, lawmakers added $200 million to the fund and for the first time allowed localities to use the money for sewer projects.
Across New Mexico, water systems need more than $3 billion for their drinking water infrastructure, according to a presentation on Wednesday by the Municipal League to the NMFA Oversight Committee.
Looking only at municipal water systems, the projects that cities have identified as needed over the next three years will cost at least $1.2 billion, according to the presentation. That only includes projects for which cities have applied for funding from the state Water Trust Board.
“Until the applications come in, we won’t know what that true need is,” said AJ Forte, executive director of the Municipal League, who by law also serves as vice chair of the Water Trust Board.
“I wish they would all apply, because then we could make the case to all of you: here’s the number that would be needed to get these systems up and running,” Forte told the committee. “We know it’s in the billions.”
Some examples include big cities like Albuquerque, which has more than $294 million in identified, unfunded drinking water projects, to small villages like Des Moines in northeast New Mexico, which needs just over $1.9 million for its drinking water infrastructure.

,California,2025-07-11 14:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Deaf Mongolian immigrant held by ICE in California for 4 months with no access to interpreter,Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/ice-detention-deaf-asylum-seeker/,A disabled immigrant’s detention underscores the shift in asylum policies at the Mexico border since President Trump took office.,"In summary
A disabled immigrant’s detention underscores the shift in asylum policies at the Mexico border since President Trump took office. 


A deaf and mute Mongolian man has spent more than four months in a Southern California immigrant detention center without the opportunity to communicate with anyone who understands Mongolian Sign Language, according to his civil rights attorney. 
“He’s basically been in solitary confinement because he has not had one person actually speak to him in Mongolian Sign Language for the entirety of the time that he’s been in proceedings and detained,” said his attorney, Alegría De La Cruz, director of litigation for the Disability Rights Legal Center.
U.S. Southern District of California Judge Dana Sabraw this week ordered officials at the Otay Mesa Detention Center to provide him with a Mongolian Sign Language interpreter. 
The judge also directed immigration authorities to redo two assessments that could affect his request for asylum. One would examine his mental health, and the other would evaluate whether he has a credible fear for his safety if he returns to his country. 
“How can he meaningfully participate if he doesn’t know what’s being said and he cannot communicate?” Sabraw asked a federal attorney at the hearing on Wednesday. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Dimbleby said many people don’t fully understand the legal proceedings in immigration court. 
The man’s family requested that CalMatters identify him by the name Avirmed because of their fear that he could be harmed by the Mongolian government if he is returned to his home country. 
Avirmed’s detention after seeking asylum underscores the sharp shift in border policies from the Biden administration to Trump’s. 
Under Biden, asylum seekers who were not threats to public safety were often released on bond rather than being detained while their cases moved through immigration court. The Trump administration has taken a much stricter approach with detention numbers reaching record highs – a tactic his supporters say is working. Since President Donald Trump took office, unauthorized border crossings have plummeted to historic lows.  
But Avirmed’s representation by the Disability Rights Legal Center also shows how some immigrant advocates are changing tactics in response to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. In this case, they’re drawing on federal disability laws that prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities by any federal program, including the immigration court system.
The Trump administration recognizes its “own power, and it can be very dangerous unless someone checks it the way the judge did,” said Sylvia Torres-Guillen, the president and CEO of the organization.
Key ICE interviews without interpreters
Avirmed left Mongolia early this year and entered the U.S.in February seeking asylum from persecution because of his disability. A 2020 assault in Mongolia left him with a traumatic brain injury that causes seizures and memory loss. He was attacked because of his disability, according to court records. His family declined to say how he reached the U.S.
A legal complaint filed on his behalf says Avirmed gave border officials a letter written in Mongolian and translated into English, notifying them of his disability and his intent to seek asylum. Customs and Border Protection agents refused to read or accept the letter, his attorneys allege in the complaint against the Department of Homeland Security. 
Agents transferred him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where he was placed in detention at the for-profit Otay Mesa Detention Center, run by CoreCivic, where he is still being held. 
Agents interviewed him without an attorney or sign language interpreter and tried using Google Translate to ask him if he feared returning to Mongolia, according to the complaint. They badly misunderstood him, identifying his sponsor as a daughter named Virginia Washington when he does not have a daughter, according to the lawsuit. His sponsor is his sister, who lives in Virginia. 
Avirmed also underwent a mental health evaluation without any interpretation, which the judge ordered ICE to repeat, saying he “has a right to be involved where he understands and can respond and communicate, and be part of the process, not a bystander.” 
California officials have been critical of mental health resources in ICE detention centers. By law, they have access to inspect federal immigration detention facilities. An April report from California’s Attorney General’s office documented what it described as severely inadequate mental health care services inside ICE facilities.
“No facilities consistently offered adequate psychotherapy services for the mental health conditions most commonly observed in detainee populations in California,” the report states, naming detention centers in Imperial and San Diego counties that California officials found to have behavioral health staffing vacancies.
The companies that operate the detention centers contested the attorney general’s findings, with one calling the report an example of a “politicized campaign” to interfere with deportation efforts.
‘Like Greek to me’
Avirmed has no criminal record. According to ICE’s data, which shows less than 10% or 125 out of 1,350 people currently detained at Otay Mesa have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor.
Sabraw, the judge, agreed with De La Cruz and Avirmed’s other attorneys that the 48-year-old man was likely unable to understand what was happening during earlier proceedings, so they should be repeated with an interpreter and in a language he understands. 
“He has a right, doesn’t he? To be able to fully participate in any significant proceeding?” Sabraw asked Dimbleby. 
“MSL (Mongolian Sign Language) is not a super common language,” Dimbleby argued at one point. 
For future proceedings, the federal government had proposed providing Avirmed a “relay team” that would allow him to testify through a certified deaf interpreter. The interpreter would then translate the testimony into American Sign Language, and then the ASL would be translated into spoken English. 
 “Under this relay proposal, everyone would understand except for Mr. Avirmed,” Sabraw pointed out. 
The judge said the government’s plan does not allow Avirmed to participate in court proceedings because he does not understand English or ASL.
“That’s like speaking Greek to me,” Sabraw said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/051818_Otay-Mesa-Detention-Center_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-11 11:24:02.608448

(Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)Democrats had little nice to say about the budget- and tax-cutting One Big Beautiful Bill that was the subject of a town hall in Germantown Thursday night, but they still tried to leave the audience with some hope.
“If our courts hold, we’re going to be OK,” Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th) told the crowd of about 100 at the Montgomery College campus in Germantown. “We’re going to get through this, and we’re going to be able to turn this back.”
McClain Delaney was joined at the 90-minute event by Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) and Attorney General Anthony Brown to discuss the fallout of the budget reconciliation that was a top priority of President Donald Trump, who signed it amid considerable ceremony on the Fourth of July.
The bill extends tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term, which were scheduled to expire this year, but it also makes steep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance program and prohibits federal funds to Planned Parenthood. Its passage last week capped a tumultuous first six months for Trump, who has tried to make sweeping cuts to federal agencies and the federal workforce, a mainstay of Maryland’s economy.
As comptroller, Lierman said she sees every dollar going in to and out of state government. From March to May, she said, 8,500 Marylanders lost federal jobs. The months since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration have been an “existential crisis” for Americans, she said.

“It’s also incredibly personal,” Lierman said. “It’s our neighbors losing their jobs. It’s my sister-in-law being laid off from her refugee resettlement agency because USAID [the U.S. Agency for International Development] was canceled.”
One audience member asked whether there is anything Marylanders can feel hope about. Lierman pointed to the record numbers of people who have turned out to protest.
“It’s not just that; it’s also the work that’s happening in our community every day — whether it’s extra volunteers showing up at the Upcounty Hub, whether it’s folks showing up at some of the other food banks around the state, donations to libraries,” Lierman said. “One of the things that we’re seeing is that people are recognizing the need to support our institutions.”
Brown said, who has joined other states on dozens of lawsuits challenging Trump administratiion actions, said he has felt hopeful after seeing that the courts are still working. Judges who were appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents have invalidated the actions of the administration, he said — such as in the birthright citizenship and Kilmar Arbrego Garcia cases. 
Lierman said that, despite seeing what she called a deconstruction of norms and federal agencies that the country has relied on for decades, the community has continued to show up.
“It’s incredibly cool and chaotic,” she said. “And it’s hard to witness — but we are witnessing it, and we’re not backing down.”

(Courtesy of Samantha Warren/ UMaine System)A Belfast church is appealing a federal judge’s decision that allowed the University of Maine System to rescind the church’s winning bid for a university-owned building, arguing that the university discriminated against the church over its religious beliefs.
Liberty Counsel, a Christian legal and advocacy organization, filed a brief on behalf of Calvary Chapel Friday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, seeking to reverse federal Judge Stacey Neumann’s denial of a preliminary injunction that would have paused the sale of the Hutchinson Center in Belfast to another bidder.
The church’s lawsuit stems from the system’s decision last year to reject the church’s initial winning bid for the Hutchinson Center, a 38,000-square-foot former continuing education center, after a wave of public backlash. 
UMaine initially accepted Calvary Chapel’s offer to purchase the Hutchinson Center, which at one point used to house the only in-person higher education programming in the region. Two other community nonprofit organizations in the area also bid for the building, and raised objections when the system initially accepted the church’s bid. UMaine then determined that its original criteria for evaluating the bids were incorrect, and reopened the bid. Waldo Community Action Partners won the second round, with a promise to keep housing the internet hub the Hutchinson Center hosts.
“Calvary Chapel Belfast rightfully won the University of Maine System’s first bidding process. The church participated in the bidding process in good faith, but UMS then unlawfully rescinded their winning bid due to its religious beliefs under the excuse of procedural deficiencies,” Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said in a statement. “Such discrimination is unlawful, and an injunction is necessary to restore the church’s bid award and stop these unconstitutional actions.”
Neumann rejected the appeal due to lack of direct evidence of religious discrimination, and UMaine has also denied allegations of discrimination. In the second round, Waldo CAP offered to pay $3.06 million for the property, compared to $1.1 million offered by Calvary Chapel Belfast and $1.8 million offered by another bidder. 
“The court has repeatedly upheld that the transparent, competitive process through which our system has sought to sell the Hutchinson Center offered fair opportunity to all parties,” said system spokesperson Samantha Warren in response to the appeal and the most recent filing. “That includes those who may be disappointed by our decision to ultimately award the right to negotiate sale terms and conditions to a community organization that offered more than double the purchase price of any other bidder.”
However, Liberty Counsel pointed to rulings from other federal appeals courts that, according to the brief, establish that when government decisions closely follow community backlash rooted in bias, both direct and indirect evidence of discriminatory intent can be considered valid.
. The Hutchinson Center closed in 2022 as part of the university system’s cost-cutting and consolidation efforts. Its sale has since drawn statewide attention due to the controversy over the church’s involvement and the broader questions about religious freedom and government neutrality, and even involved a failed legislative attempt to allow municipalities first right of refusal, sponsored by Democratic Belfast Rep. Jan Dodge.

Free.,"New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-national-school-voucher-program-included-big-beautiful-law-no-cap-cost,,"WASHINGTON — A national private school voucher program is now law, though the school choice initiative comes with a huge caveat. States also choose — whether or not to participate. It’s a setback for advocates who hoped to see the program — baked into the mega tax and spending cut bill President Donald Trump signed into law on July Fourth — mandated in all 50 states.The permanent program, which starts in 2027, saw several versions between the House and Senate before getting to Trump’s desk as part of congressional Republicans’ massive reconciliation package.Robert Enlow, president and CEO of EdChoice, touted aspects of the program, but said his organization would have preferred to see a 50-state program, rather than allowing states to opt in or decline. “I think I’m really worried about that because this is seen as a sort of more partisan issue and as a result, what would make a governor in a blue state say, ‘Let me bring in school choice’?” said Enlow, whose nonprofit focuses on advancing school choice options.Still, Enlow described the program as “just another step along the way of giving parents more choices.”Who will join?It remains to be seen which states will participate, including those with their own voucher programs already underway.Jon Valant, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said he’s “not clear on how states will shake out on the question of whether or not to participate.”“I’m sure the vast majority of, really, all red states will participate in this thing, but I don’t know what’s going to happen in blue and purple states,” said Valant, who also serves as director of the think tank’s Brown Center on Education Policy.Despite that unknown, Valant said that states “do have some incentive to participate because if they don’t, then they’re potentially losing access to some funds that they wouldn’t otherwise get.”How the program worksThe program allocates up to $1,700 in federal tax credits for individuals who donate to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.There is also no cap to the cost of the program, unlike earlier versions seen in both chambers of Congress.The scholarship funds would be available to families whose household incomes do not exceed 300 percent of their area’s median gross income.More than 138 million people could be eligible to make use of the tax credit in 2027, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.However, Carl Davis, research director of the left-leaning think tank, notes in the analysis that “most of those people will not contribute” given the necessary paperwork and vouchers’ unpopularity with the public.A state’s program participation will be decided by its governor or “by such other individual, agency, or entity as is designated under State law to make such elections on behalf of the State with respect to Federal tax benefits,” according to the final bill text.The GOP’s school choice pushThe umbrella term “school choice” centers on alternative programs to one’s assigned public school.The effort has sparked controversy, as opponents say these programs drain critical funds and resources from school districts, while school choice advocates describe the initiatives as necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools.Trump and congressional Republicans have made school choice a major part of their education agenda.The program also reflects a sweeping bill that GOP Reps. Adrian Smith of Nebraska and Burgess Owens of Utah and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana reintroduced in their respective chambers earlier this year.'Very little quality control'Valant, of the Brookings Institution, expressed several concerns about the program, saying “there’s very little quality control, transparency or accountability for outcomes in this program, and it’s potentially a major use of public taxpayer funds.”He said he doesn’t see anything in the program’s text that “protects against widespread waste, fraud and abuse and from programs and schools that aren’t providing much value at all to students from continuing to get a large amount of funding.”The program also came as Trump and his administration continue to dramatically redefine the federal role in education.Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for $12 billion in spending cuts to the Education Department. A summary from the department said this cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.”Billions on holdThe administration has also taken heat for its recent decision to put on hold $6.8 billion in federal funds for K-12 schools.Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy at AASA, The School Superintendents Association, said that a time when the administration is withholding billions of dollars in these funds for public schools, “the idea that we’re going to spend an unlimited amount of tax dollars to support private and religious schools is unthinkable, unimaginable — it’s horrific.”“This is yet another handout to wealthy Americans who can already afford to send their children to private religious schools and at a cost that comes from tax dollars being deferred away from public education that serve the poorest and neediest students in America,” added Pudelski, whose organization helps to ensure every child has access to a high quality public education.",,,,2025-07-11 11:24:02.608448

Article Summary

Longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, who spent decades as a close friend and advisor to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, is scheduled for sentencing later this month as part of separate hearings for the “ComEd Four” beginning next week.
McClain and his co-defendants were convicted in 2023 for their roles in bribing Madigan with jobs and contracts for his political allies at electric utility Commonwealth Edison while the company was pushing for legislation in Springfield.
Federal prosecutors are asking a judge to sentence McClain to 70 months in prison, while the ex-lobbyist is asking for probation.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


CHICAGO — Federal prosecutors are recommending nearly six years in prison for ex-Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, the longtime friend and advisor of former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan.

McClain was the marquee defendant in the 2023 “ComEd Four” trial, which ended in across-the-board bribery convictions for former lobbyists and executives of electric utility Commonwealth Edison. The four were found guilty orchestrating a yearslong bribery scheme targeted at Madigan, in which the powerful speaker’s allies got jobs and contracts at ComEd while the utility pushed for favorable legislation in Springfield.

For more than two years, McClain and his co-defendants have been awaiting sentencing, delayed by concerns of possible impact from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the death of the judge who oversaw the ComEd Four case, and Madigan’s own lengthy trial, in which McClain was also a defendant.

But after a jury in February delivered a split verdict in Madigan’s case, including deadlocking on all six corruption counts McClain was also charged with, sentencing hearings for the ComEd Four were scheduled for July. And on Thursday, prosecutors asked a federal judge to give McClain 70 months — nearly six years — in prison.

“McClain’s plan was illegal to its core,” prosecutors wrote in their 48-page sentencing memo Thursday. “In securing benefits for both Madigan and ComEd, McClain corrupted the legislative process and the internal control processes of a large, regulated utility.”

The feds also pointed to “McClain’s repeated overstepping of legal lines,” which they characterized as “stunning” and “egregious” — especially when it came to the $1.3 million ComEd paid out in contracts to a handful of Madigan allies who did little to no work for the company. Prosecutors referred to the no-work contractors as the former speaker’s “cronies” and accused McClain of knowing the contracts were a quid pro quo.

But in a competing filing Thursday, McClain’s attorneys asked for probation for the ex-lobbyist, citing his health and warning that a long sentence could mean he’d “die alone in prison.” His lawyers also reiterated their longtime argument that McClain’s efforts to get jobs and contracts for those in Madigan’s orbit was merely “legal and constitutionally protected lobbying.”

“Simply put, over almost a decade, Mr. McClain passed along and advocated for a handful of job recommendations from Madigan because of Madigan’s position both as an influential member of the General Assembly and, in no small measure, because Madigan was Mr. McClain’s old and close friend,” McClain’s attorneys wrote.

Madigan last month was sentenced to 90 months in prison and a $2.5 million fine for his guilty convictions, the majority of which stemmed from the same ComEd scheme.

Starting in 2011, ComEd notched several big legislative wins in Springfield, turning the tide of Madigan’s longtime opposition to bills pushed by utility companies. The General Assembly’s actions were worth millions of dollars to ComEd and its parent company Exelon.

During trial, McClain and his other co-defendants pointed to ComEd’s sophisticated — and expensive — multi-year lobbying strategy as the reason for the company’s luck changing in Springfield. But jurors sided with prosecutors’ theory that the company effectively bribed Madigan, showering the powerful speaker with a “stream of benefits” in the form of jobs and contracts, which greased the wheels of the legislative process.

In their filing, the feds characterized McClain as “politically savvy,” glossing through his decades in Springfield, which included 10 years as a Democratic member of the Illinois House, where he first met Madigan in the early 1970s.

“McClain’s tight connection with Madigan translated into McClain, without hesitation, making demand after demand of ComEd to fulfill Madigan’s directives, for which, in return, McClain expected ComEd would get the legislation it wanted,” prosecutors wrote. “McClain dealt with both Madigan and ComEd with eyes wide open and with full knowledge of the mutually beneficial, and wholly illegal, arrangement he helped to bestow on each of them.”

In addition to the no-work contractors, the alleged scheme also included ComEd’s multi-year contract with a law firm co-owned by Democratic fundraiser and Madigan ally Victor Reyes. Madigan also pushed for the appointment of Juan Ochoa to ComEd’s board, and prosecutors outlined several other jobs and internships at the utility that originated from Madigan.

But McClain’s attorneys insisted McClain simply took “into account” the fact that Madigan was an influential public official and treated his requests with more attention than those “from a less influential official.”

“That, too, is not only legal and rational lobbying but is true of any request for a favor anyone gets from anyone: the more important the relationship, the more effort will be spent to try to accommodate the request,” McClain’s lawyers wrote.

Though U.S. District Judge Manish Shah granted a partial retrial in March after throwing out some bribery counts, prosecutors instead asked to forge ahead with sentencing.

The feds earlier this week also recommended a 70-month sentence for former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, who testified in her own defense at trial. And last week, prosecutors asked that former ComEd exec John Hooker be sentenced to 56 months in prison. Both instead asked for probation. Sentencing recommendations have not yet been filed for ComEd lobbyist Jay Doherty, whose Aug. 5 hearing will be the last of the ComEd Four.

Record outbreak comes as vaccine skepticism increasingly gains a federal foothold.




Measles cases have surpassed a recent 2019 record to reach the highest level since 1992, with at least 1,289 cases reported in 39 states.
The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
SC reports first measles case of 2025 amid national outbreak

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Low prices for row crops and high costs for fertilizer are squeezing Midwest row-crop farmers while the Southeast is still on an economic winning streak, according to a Stateline analysis of federal economic data for the first quarter. (Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.


There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

I haven’t tracked all those efforts but my impression is that a majority of them, especially the better-funded ones, are warmed-over echoes of the old Democratic Leadership Council.
During the ‘80s and ‘90s, trying to cope with the conservative ascendancy personified by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, the DLC was the brain trust driving Democrats to capitulate to Republicans and parrot Republican talking points. 
As a result, the nation was saddled with an economic policy “debate” spanning the ideological spectrum from A all the way to B, as Democratic surrender cemented a bipartisan dominant narrative of market worship that continues to handcuff policy options to the present day. 
And all the while, the wealth gap broadened, and economic inequities intensified, to the point that a critical mass of voters, and a majority of them in Nevada last year, said oh what the hell we might as well elect Pennywise president.
Of perhaps particular interest to Nevadans, that miserable Democratic surrender led to the cynically triangulated center-right policies of Clinton and Clintonism. Ooh, let’s show how pro-business we are by deregulating the financial services industry and see what it does to the housing market!  What could possibly go wrong? etc. (Entrenchment of a bipartisan “pro-business” mantra also led to the popularization of tax credits and other government giveaways in the name of “economic development,” which are now, well, the status quo.)
Today’s Democrats may think that vowing to protect health care and hoping for tariffs to wreck the economy while otherwise broadly caving to Trumpism may be the best strategy they’ve got. But this isn’t 1992. A year from now, when election season is in full swing, rising prices and Democrats constantly chanting “Medicaid” might not be near as important to the contemporary electorate as a UFC show on the White House lawn.
Meanwhile, a separate Times story Thursday about yet another new Democratic organizing effort to save the Democratic Party mentioned Nevada Assemblyman Howard Watts, who was at the group’s kickoff event in Philadelphia.
The group, earnestly called States Forum, is focusing on the importance of policies implemented at the state level (Watts, according to the Times, spoke about how hard it can be to recruit candidates to run for the state office), the idea being that … Trump has rendered the federal government a lost cause for the foreseeable future so our only hope is saving democracy and the rule of law one state at a time? Or something like that.
State-level elected officials nationwide, chips permanently lodged on their shoulders, frequently crow about how innovative and successful they’ve been on the policy front while whining that they don’t get the credit they’re due. Sometimes they’re right.
But states of course can also be the laboratories of deplorable policy. 
And states can bitterly cling to those policies.
A couple Nevada examples that come to mind… A few years ago, when Democrats controlled both houses of the Nevada Legislature and the governor’s office for four years, there was (and remains) no appetite to reform a regressive and unfair state tax structure that’s both morally and intellectually bankrupt. And attempts to fix a notoriously tenant-hostile quickie eviction process collapsed under the weight of special interest clout.
And yet there is no question that some great innovations are happening at the state level that can and should be tailored for and adopted by other states.
For example, Washington state, like Nevada, has no state income tax, and hence, like Nevada, had a regressive tax structure in which the smaller your income, the larger the percentage of that income you pay in taxes. So in 2021 the state enacted a tax on wealth. That tax not only raised far more revenue for schools, child care and other public programs and services than expected, but has proven popular, and Washington voters overwhelmingly approved retaining it last year. 
That’s just one of countless smart ideas that have been devised and implemented by states. There are oodles more.
And it’s not as if they’re a secret. Sure, a national coordinated organization urging the sharing and adoption of state-level policies to remove barriers that make life harder than it needs to be might be nice. State-level political will would be nicer.
All these new attempts to determine what Democrats will be when they grow up might contribute to the sum total of human goodness or whatever.
More likely, they’ll push Democrats closer to Trumpism — on immigration and LGBTQ+ rights, in addition to economics — effectively assuring it will be even harder and take even longer to reverse Trump-era policies.
That’s more or less what happened when Democrats surrendered to Reagan-Thatcherism, as evidenced by steadfast affection among so many Nevada elected Democrats for tolerating regressive taxation or tenant-hostile statutes, or giving public subsidies to private sector interests that don’t need public subsidies. That’s why so many elected Nevada Democrats can still be relied upon to preserve and protect, well, the status quo.

Ed Lewis, R-Moberly, stands on the House floor Wednesday during the last day of special session. Lewis sponsored legislation seeking to restrict teachers from using a controversial method of reading instruction as their primary tool (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers have banned educators from leaning on a model of reading instruction called the “three-cueing” method as part of a bipartisan education package signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe on Wednesday.
The law mandates that three cueing, which teaches students to read using context clues, can be used to supplement lessons, but phonics should be the majority of instruction.
State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican and sponsor of the legislation, told The Independent that the law builds on prior legislative efforts and work from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
“We’ve come to the realization that phonics is crucial,” Lewis said. “The three cueing system, when used as the primary source, evidence shows a decrease in the amount of learning that occurs, and for that reason, we want to use it less.”
Three cueing is widely criticized for encouraging kids to make guesses when reading and doesn’t show how to sound out words, which is important for understanding complicated texts.
Missouri isn’t the only state to ban three cueing. By the end of 2024, at least 11 states had explicitly banned the method.
The problem with three cueing, which once was lauded as an alternative to phonics, came to public attention when American Public Media reporter Emily Hanford investigated reading instruction and later launched the podcast series “Sold a Story.”
The series armed those backing the “science of reading” in a longstanding war between phonics instruction and context-clue-based models and state laws followed — including a literacy bill passed in Missouri in 2022.
The 2022 legislation required state education officials to create a teacher preparatory course on literacy. DESE, in turn, launched its “Read, Lead, Exceed” initiative, including instruction for educators.
As of this spring, 429 school districts and over 8,600 educators have had training in Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS.
“It is pretty intense training,” Missouri Education Commissioner Karla Eslinger told The Independent. “It creates an opportunity for the teachers to use that science of reading, that evidence-based best practices on how you teach reading.”
The training and other science-backed materials provided by the department are not mandatory but participation has been encouraging, Eslinger said.
She expects elementary literacy rates to rise as a result of the training and other efforts since 2022, like literacy coaches the department hired.
With a charge to ban three cueing as the primary form of reading instruction, Eslinger said the department will continue to push best practices.
“We are not going to police this,” she said. “We are going to show good practice and give support to good practice, so it just bolsters what we’re doing.”
As part of a checklist school districts provide annually to the department, they will be required to confirm that they are not using three cueing as a primary instructional model.
“The work that our literacy teams are doing in the state is all being very well received. (Educators) are wanting more and more,” Eslinger said. “It is not because it is mandated, it is because it works.”

	An interdisciplinary team of scientists, collaborating with Alaska Native whale hunters and other North Slope residents, studied bowel samples taken over nearly two decades from 205 subsistence-harvested bowheads, looking for evidence of toxins from algae.
According to the findings published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, a dangerous neurotoxin called saxitoxin turned up in at least half of the whales sampled.
Produced by algal blooms, saxitoxin can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, an often agonizing and untreatable condition that can be fatal in humans. They also found varying levels of domoic acid, another neurotoxin produced by algal blooms, a phenomenon increasingly common in northern waters.
Warming Arctic conditions resulting from climate change are increasing the prevalence and concentration of neurotoxins in the whales’ poop, researchers found. These conditions include shrinking sea ice, expanding tracts of open water and more sunlight penetrating the ocean’s depths.
“We have a direct relationship between higher toxin concentrations and warmer ocean conditions,” said Kathi Lefebvre, the paper’s lead author and a research biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle. “There is a very strong mechanistic link.”
Marine biologists consider whales a sentinel species because they feed throughout the water column by scooping up tiny crustaceans, namely krill and copepods.
“They’re going through the ocean basically with their mouths open,” said Rick Thoman, a climate scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and co-author on the paper. “They’re not selective. What’s ever in that water, what’s ever in that krill, they’re ingesting into their bodies.”
Understanding what’s inside these filter feeders unlocks knowledge about what’s happening in the ocean and food web.  
“They’re a good proxy for what’s in the environment,” Thoman said.

	Through prior research, scientists already knew that melting sea ice and growing tracts of open water spur proliferation of two marine algal species, Pseudo-nitzschia and Alexandrium catenella. These algae produce domoic acid and saxitoxin respectively, nerve toxins that accumulate in creatures like clams, krill, plankton-eating fish and zooplankton.
These organisms, in turn, pass the poisons on to larger marine wildlife or humans who eat them.
There’s no evidence that the levels of neurotoxins found inside the bowheads pose any human health risk, Lefebvre noted.
But because the whales are a sentinel species, the results from 19 years of fecal samples are worrisome, especially in a remote region where residents heavily depend on ocean animals for a huge portion of their diet and in a place where temperatures are accelerating nearly four times faster than the rest of the world.  
The 10th-warmest set of ocean temperatures in northern Alaska waters since 1900 have been recorded since 2000. As the ice melts, warmer waters are pushing northward, leading to cascading effects on marine ecosystems, according to previous research. Given those trends, scientists expect the prevalence and concentration of neurotoxins in whales and other species to increase over time.  
Some of the world’s largest beds of Alexandrium cysts already exist in northern Alaska waters, according to the study. Until recently, cold ocean temperatures prevented algal cysts, or seeds, from germinating. But that’s radically changed in the last 10 or so years as ocean warming has accelerated. 
To understand the dynamics of how ocean temperatures influence toxin levels, scientists used a mooring in the Beaufort Sea, about 93 miles east of Point Barrow, that’s been maintained since 2002. Researchers outfitted the mooring with an array of instruments to monitor water temperature, velocity and other metrics.
The data showed that whales feeding in warmer spots had higher concentrations of algal toxins. And in places with big stretches of open water with sunlight penetrating, algae grow more quickly, boosting the odds of whales ingesting toxin-laden krill and other food. 
Besides finding that anywhere between 44% and 100% of fecal samples contained saxitoxin, the scientists also found between zero and 100% of samples had domoic acid present. Domoic acid can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, a condition that can cause seizures and coma. 
Given the overall direction of where conditions seem to be headed, there’s an urgent need for greater surveillance of algal blooms, marine mammals and other ocean species, said Gay Sheffield, a marine biologist and extension agent with Alaska Sea Grant, a partnership between NOAA and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
A study co-author, Sheffield said there’s been too many deaths and close calls already with people eating clams, crab and other ocean foods containing dangerous levels of neurotoxins. 
Five people in Alaska died of paralytic shellfish poisoning in 1994, 1997, 2010 and 2020, according to a bulletin from the state epidemiologist. During the time period from 1993 to 2021, the epidemiology section reported 79 total incidents.  
Paralytic shellfish poisoning is a condition to be avoided at all costs. Mild symptoms can include tingling, difficulty swallowing, dizziness and muscle weakness. If the condition worsens, it can lead to brainstem dysfunction, respiratory failure and death. 
“There is no antidote for people. You just have to ride this out. It’s palliative care. You have to ride it out. You get IVs, you’re throwing up and you’re pooping. You’re peeing it out. But it’s a strain on your intestine, liver and kidneys,” Sheffield said.  
Of the patients for whom race was recorded, more than half were Alaska Native, according to the bulletin. 
While changing conditions in Alaska’s Arctic are stressful and cause for concern, one positive trend Sheffield points to is that diverse communities are now actively working together, sharing data and traditional ecological knowledge, and otherwise collaborating to find solutions and to protect public health and the food web.
The whales in the study were harvested by subsistence hunters from the Beaufort Sea region between 2004 and 2022. Eleven bowhead whaling communities participated, along with the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission and the North Slope Borough, through its bowhead harvesting management program. 
“Through the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management, and the (whaling) captains’ associations for the Beaufort Sea, we have access to the whales,” for study purposes, said Sheffield. “It’s like giant teamwork.” 
Lefebvre and others on the research team are gearing up for their next research project, which she said will expand the search for algal toxins in other marine species used for food, including walrus.  
Although government downsizing and funding cuts have thrown many federally funded research projects into doubt, Lefebvre is crossing her fingers that algal toxin work in Alaska’s Arctic will continue. 
“I know it’s of great importance to lots of people,” she said.

To spur more housing in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature carved out notable exceptions to California’s 54-year-old environmental review law as part of the state budget deal they hammered out last week. But rolling back parts of the landmark statute might have not happened had it not been for one particular construction union.
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang and Ben Christopher explain, the California Conference of Carpenters worked with Democratic lawmakers to push the law’s exemption for certain apartment developments by supporting a proposal that would have allowed developers to pay residential construction workers — who are mostly all non-union — a lower minimum wage than those required for publicly subsidized projects relatively on par with union-level pay.
The proposal was ultimately scrapped after drawing severe criticism from the influential State Building and Construction Trades Council, which argued that it would undercut pay standards. But the rift between the two groups highlighted the Carpenters’ alternative approach to view non-union workers not as competition, but as prospective members worth protecting. Having the support of the Carpenters, if not the Trades, has been crucial for lawmakers seeking changes to state housing policy.

Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and author of several housing bills: “It changed everything. It created more space for more dialogue and less of the ‘my way or the highway’ approach.”

Another housing shakeup: Ben also reports on California’s newest state agency exclusively focused on housing and homelessness issues. Spun out of the reorganization of an existing state agency that oversees a grab bag of other policy matters, the new cabinet-level department would prioritize two of California’s highest-profile, persistent crises, as well as streamline the state’s various affordable housing financing systems.
Though it’s too soon to know what effects the agency will have on increasing housing and making it more affordable, some legislators and housing advocates have expressed skepticism about whether a bureaucratic reshuffling could significantly turn things around.

Can AI help prevent homelessness?

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
New data suggests artificial intelligence can be effective at preventing homelessness, according to an analysis of a Los Angeles County-based program that uses an algorithm to predict who is likely to end up on the street.
As CalMatters previously reported, the program, which launched in 2021, reaches out to those people before they lose their housing and gives them each an average of about $6,500 to pay for necessities such as rent, utilities, transportation and resolving debt. 
People who participated in the pilot program between May 2022 and February 2023 were 71% less likely to end up in a homeless shelter or make contact with a street outreach team than people with similar risk factors who weren’t enrolled in the program, according to a California Policy Lab study released Thursday. 
But getting people signed up is a challenge. Only about one in five people the program administrators reached out to during the pilot period ultimately enrolled. 
The program is ongoing, and additional data from a more formal randomized trial will be available after 2027.

The Assembly is considering a bill with strong bipartisan support that would prohibit online streaming services from increasing the volume during commercials, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow. 
But does the state have the authority to regulate streaming services, or would this undermine federal regulations?
In 2010 President Barack Obama signed a law granting the Federal Communications Commission the ability to issue rules that ensured that the average volume of TV commercials couldn’t be louder than the programming they aired with. In recent years, some members of Congress have tried, and failed, to include streaming platforms to the law.
Citing a 2014 federal appeals court case, UC Berkeley Law Professor Tejas Narechania said California could attempt to achieve what Congress couldn’t do by enacting “consumer protections aimed at California residents, even if they affected out-of-state content providers.”
California’s entertainment industry opposes the bill. During a June Assembly committee hearing, Melissa Patack, a spokesperson for the Motion Picture Association, argued that streaming services have already done “a significant amount of work” to address excessive volume with ads.

""When Aiden Became a Brother"" can be seen in the front. Pierce County LibraryA south Georgia public library system is under pressure to rehire a librarian whose firing over a book about a transgender child has led to the resignation of a board member and a wrongful termination lawsuit, according to emails and text messages obtained by the Georgia Recorder.
At the start of June, former Pierce County Library Manager Lavonnia Moore said she approved a display of children’s books collected by young library patrons that included “When Aidan Became a Brother” by Kyle Lukoff, which is about a transgender boy whose family is expecting another child.
On June 18, Moore was fired over the display. A group called Alliance for Faith and Family, which called on followers to register complaints with Three Rivers Regional Library staff and Pierce County commissioners, took credit for the sacking on social media.
The Georgia Recorder filed an open records request for all communications received by library staff and county commissioners relating to Moore during the month of June.
The county produced 77 files, some of which were repeat copies of emails sent by the same person to multiple recipients in the government. Accounting for duplicates, about four times as many people contacted the government in favor of reinstating Moore than did firing her.
The emails, text messages and voicemail reveal more about the decision to let Moore go and the resulting backlash. That correspondence also shows that local officials are considering reinstating Moore but have not yet done so.
Transgender people, particularly minors, have been the focal point of political debate at the state and federal levels. Georgia lawmakers passed or considered multiple high-profile bills this session and President Donald Trump has signed numerous executive orders aimed at transgender people.
Fallout
In text messages with Pierce County Manager Raphel Maddox and a human resources staffer from the day Moore was fired, Pierce County Library Board Member Lana Blankenship, who also works in the county finance department, reposted Alliance for Faith and Family’s calls to fire Moore.
“I am so mad right now,” Blankenship said with an angry emoji. “She needs to go immediately.”
The book display stirred back up a local conflict over other LGBTQ-related issues at the library. The Pierce County library left the Okefenokee Regional Library System last year, joining the Three Rivers system last July after controversies including over a Pride display and bathroom policies.
But in an email addressed to Pierce County’s library board members, Three Rivers Regional Library Director Jeremy Snell, who Moore said fired her, proposed a special called meeting to discuss bringing her back, citing an outpouring of support.
“It is within the power of this board to make action calling for reinstatement if that is a desired result of the executive session discussion,” Snell wrote. “At this point, I have received more communication regarding reinstatement (than) I did regarding the original issue earlier this week.”
In an email to the Recorder Thursday, Snell said the board was set to hold a regular meeting July 15 but since a quorum is not expected, a special called meeting will likely be held sometime in July. Snell said an agenda has not been set but the meeting could include an executive session.
On June 25, Snell received an email from an attorney representing Moore informing them of a wrongful termination suit and calling on them to hang onto any documents that may become evidence.
The next day, Laci Gillis Tippins resigned from the Pierce County library board, citing “recently developing political controversies” as well as time constraints and workloads in her private law practice. Tippins requested that her name be promptly removed from all websites and literature associated with the board.
“It has been a pleasure to serve on the Board,” she wrote. “I hope the current political climate cools and all disputes are resolved swiftly so the Library may thrive and flourish once again, as it did in my childhood.”
Emails
Some of the pro-Moore emails were form emails from pro-LGBTQ advocates not directly associated with the library. Some writers said they were from other parts of Georgia or other states.
Others, like Blackshear resident and Friends of the Library Treasurer Thomas Strait, said they had dealt with Moore personally.
Strait said he had asked around at multiple libraries and bookstores about a certain history book but had no luck tracking it down. He said he was delighted to come to the library and see a copy in the new books section.
“Unbeknownst to me, LaVonnia had tracked down the book and arranged to have it as part of our library,” Strait wrote. “This is not unique to me. She has done this for others. With limited funds, she focused on bringing books that patrons actually requested! That is only the bare tip of the iceberg as to what LaVonnia did for Pierce County Library. She has many exciting and creative programs that engage patrons, young and old, regardless of their religious affiliation or background, across the spectrum of race, color, creed, and, yes, sexual orientation. Libraries are for EVERYONE!”
Some in the anti-Moore faction largely made faith-based arguments that transgender people are the result of wickedness and expressed concern that the book could lead to children becoming transgender.
After Moore was fired, Pierce County Commissioner Troy Maddox responded to one local resident who had pushed for the book’s removal: “Situation taken care of. Thanks for bringing to light.”
Moore said she has received an outpouring of support from librarians around the nation and from people at home.
She said she was particularly touched by one person who reached out to say a class Moore held 15 years ago helped give her the knowledge to start her own business.
“You do your job because you love it, you don’t think you’re making big changes,” Moore said. “I didn’t know how much I was worth in the community. I just loved doing my job. And sometimes when someone comes up to me, I feel like an imposter. I’m so happy that I made a change in your life. I just didn’t know I was that change.”
She said she’s hoping for a happy ending, but she’s not sure what that might look like.
“Getting my old job back would probably be difficult for not only the library, the county, but also the library patrons, because if I do get my job back, that group would still be after me,” she said. “They would probably have me under a microscope.”

(Getty Images)You’d be forgiven if among all the scary national and international headlines of the past few weeks you missed the first meeting of the newly formed Religious Liberty Commission.
You may not have even heard of this Trump-appointed commission of almost entirely Christian Nationalists tasked with “safeguard(ing) and promot(ing) America’s founding principle of religious freedom.” If religious freedom is something you value, you need to add this to your list of things to follow, because the first meeting made it clear that we are headed towards the end of religious freedom for all in our country. As an atheist, that really scares me.
President Donald Trump announced the commission during the National Day of Prayer event May 1. It is responsible for creating a report with recommendations for the president, due on July 4, 2026 (the 250th anniversary of our independence, just in case their intent to push the falsehood that the USA was founded as a Christian nation isn’t clear enough). The commission is just one of Trump’s many actions to appease his evangelical base, including his establishment of a “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias” in February.
Religious extremists have been messaging around “Christian discrimination” for decades. They have fabricated a narrative where they are victimized by anyone who believes, lives, loves, or looks different than they do. This effectively scares the public into putting its trust into officials who say they will protect them against “the other.” Evidence of these anti-Christian offenses that the commission is meant to investigate is twisted to privilege extremist religious beliefs over the safety and wellbeing of others.
As an example of so-called anti-Christian offenses, Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the arrest of 23 anti-abortion activists who were charged in 2020 with conspiring to storm an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C. Kansans are intimately familiar with the violence directed toward abortion clinics and providers after the assassination of physician George Tiller in 2009, and we don’t need to look beyond last month’s assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband to see how religious extremists target Planned Parenthood and their supporters. Instead of understanding this, Trump pardoned all 23 activists this January.
The commission is made up of almost entirely of known right-wing Christians — including Texas Lt. Gov. and Chair Dan Patrick; former HUD secretary and vice chair Ben Carson; son of Billy Graham, disgraced evangelist Franklin Graham; former Miss California Carrie Prejean Boller; lawyers from Project 2025-affiliated organizations such as First Liberty Institute and Ethics & Public Policy Center; and right-wing TV and radio hosts such as Dr. Phil. A bishop, cardinal, and rabbi round out the members in what they tout as a “diverse” representation of faiths in America.
The commission will hold several more hearings over the next year to investigate the tired list of Christian Nationalist priorities, including so-called parent rights and “school choice,” prayer in schools, vaccine mandates, government displays of religious iconography, and “anti-Christian offenses.” As expected, the other key priority voiced throughout the day was to attack the LGBTQ+ community — especially trans kids.
During this first hearing, the real objectives of the commission became abundantly clear:

Rewrite history to make America a Christian nation. A key tenet of the Christian Nationalist political ideology is that America was founded as a Christian nation, and must return to this status to secure our future success. The commission repeatedly embraced this very narrow interpretation of key historical documents, including writings by the founders and the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of the First Amendment. Both commissioners and witnesses denied the principle of church-state separation and a secular government.
Remake the courts with “courageous” Christian Nationalists. The courts, specifically the U.S. Supreme Court, will be the subject of many recommendations in the final commission report. The commission discussed which cases should be overturned, how Trump’s administration can assist with that, and how to make sure pesky state and local courts don’t get in the way. The Supreme Court has been chipping away at church-state separation for the past decade with crucial victories this term, but for this commission, this isn’t happening fast enough.
Promote religion in all parts of American culture, politics, and public life (but only if it’s their version of “Christianity”). Expert witnesses referred to a divine truth — the existence of a Judeo-Christian God — as the foundation for a moral, happy, and politically good society. Many devout Americans hold similar beliefs about their faith, but also recognize that our government should not prioritize one religion in a pluralistic society. Not only does this push minority faiths and nonbelievers such as myself outside of the bounds of this “virtuous citizenry,” but it asserts that one religion (Christianity) must be imposed on every person to create and maintain this good society.

In a world where we are facing very real threats to our physical, mental, and financial health, why did I spend five excruciating hours listening to a commission whose only job is to make recommendations? The obvious answer is because these individuals were hand-selected for holding a world view that advances the Christian Nationalist agenda and threatens any religious beliefs that fall outside of this ideology. The uncomfortable truth is that this rhetoric justifies hate crimes and the dissolution of rights for women and minorities has a new platform with the divine weight of presidential approval. As a lifelong atheist, I’m scared that we’re looking at the end of church-state separation and the rise of a theocracy weaponizing religion against people who don’t fall in line.
American Atheists just announced that it will no longer be hosting the 2026 World Humanist Congress in Washington, D.C., because the “Trump Administration’s actions … have created an environment that is not only incompatible with our values but also inhospitable to members of our global secular community.” They feared for the safety of their attendees because we are no longer a country welcoming of visitors, and especially not visitors who fall outside of a specific Christian identity.
But it’s not just the secular community who should be worried right now. Every person who has found within their faith the mission to love their neighbor, feed the hungry, protect the vulnerable, and embrace the stranger should be fighting for the sanctity of their beliefs. The members of the Religious Liberty Commission will not be including these priorities in their final report, and you will not find a place for your faith in their new America.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Deep cuts to Medicaid in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will likely force thousands of Marylanders off the Medicaid rolls, creating ripple effects that advocates fear could strain and disrupt the state’s overall health care system.
“The whole situation is incredibly frustrating and a lot of harm has been done to the Maryland health care system with this bill,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society.
President Donald Trump (R) signed H.R. 1, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” last week. In addition to permanently extending some tax cuts and slashing food stamp benefits, the new law aims to cut $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over the next 10 years by reducing aid to states, imposing work requirements on benefit recipients, tightening registration rules and more.
Federal budget analysts say that 11.8 million people across the country could lose health care coverage over the next decade as a result of the changes during that time.
While the final version of the budget reconciliation act gives states more time to implement the changes than in previous versions, advocates still fear the massive cuts to funding and changes to Medicaid eligibility will disrupt Maryland’s overall health care system.
New Medicaid work requirements
An overarching concern for providers are the increased eligibility requirements under the law, particularly a stiffer work requirement. Any Medicaid recipient whose income exceeds the federal poverty level would have to work 80 hours a month, or 20 hours a week, in order to maintain coverage.
State officials, advocates map out a grim future for food benefits under federal cuts to SNAP

Maryland is one of 40 “expansion states” that accepted a Biden-era policy that let states expand Medicaid coverage to those making up to 138% of the federal poverty level. About 330,000 Marylanders are part of the “expansion population” and would be subject to the work requirement, which would take effect no later than 2028.
Supporters of the work requirement say it will cut back on wasted taxpayer dollars by ensuring that Medicaid recipients are contributing to the workforce. Opponents argue that most recipients are already working, and that they are more likely to be tripped up by the increased paperwork that will be needed to prove that they are fulfilling the 80-hour per month requirement.
Some people would be able to opt out of the work requirement, including families with children under age 14, those who are pregnant, and some people who have disabilities.
U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the only Maryland lawmaker to vote in favor of the bill, recently said that Medicaid coverage will continue for the “people who need it the most.”
“No one is taking Medicaid from those who truly need it,” he said in social media posts Monday. “Women, children, the elderly, and the disabled are protected. Period.”
The legislation also requires that the expanded Medicaid population prove eligibility every six months, beginning in 2027. Critics see that as just another hurdle for recipients, who will struggle to keep up with the frequent eligibility checks and will lose coverage as a result.
  U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st),  (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
With both of those provisions going into effect in the coming years, health care advocacy group KFF estimates that around 130,000 Marylanders will lose coverage.
Analysts from the Maryland Department of Legislative Services say that the two provisions could slash $1.1 billion in Medicaid costs in Maryland, $112 million of which would be state dollars. Those savings would be slightly offset by the increased administrative costs of having to conduct more-frequent eligibility checks.
But Ransom, with MedChi, said  those would be short term savings for the state that would be quickly eaten up by the increase in uninsured Marylanders who would lead to more expensive care and a greater strain on the health care system as a whole.
“All of these things are going to mean that we have more people who either don’t have access to a physician or don’t have insurance, so they end up not getting preventative care,” Ransom said. “They end up not getting their regular primary care visits, then they’re going to wait until they’re really bad, they’re going up in the emergency room and then we all end up paying for it.
“There might be some savings in the short run, because you throw people off – in a very mean-spirited way by making them fill out forms every six months to make sure that they’re eligible,” he said, “but the reality of it is that it’s going to hurt all of us.”
Reproductive health care
Reproductive rights advocates warn that a provision that prohibits Medicaid funding for any reproductive health care at a facility that also provides abortions — such as Planned Parenthood — will reduce access for low-income people to receive services like cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted infections.
Karen Nelson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Maryland, said that about one-third of the patients at its seven centers located throughout Maryland are Medicaid recipients.
“What it effectively did was eliminate Planned Parenthood from participating in the federal Medicaid program … and [made it] ineligible to receive payments from Medicaid,” Nelson said.” These are vulnerable populations and people are coming to us for wellness visits, cancer detection, STI testing and treatment, birth control and all of the preventative health care that keeps the community healthy.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State analysts estimate that it would cost the state about $2.5 million to make up for federal funds lost as a result of that provision.
While Planned Parenthood is often thought of as just an abortion provider, and is often the target of anti-abortion attacks. The organization believes the budget reconciliation unfairly targets it, and it filed a lawsuit to block the provision. A federal judge in Massachusetts issued a temporary restraining order this week, meaning that for the time being, Medicaid recipients can still be covered for services rendered in Planned Parenthoods.
Nelson explained that even if Medicaid recipients could continue to seek care at Planned Parenthood, the anticipated loss in health coverage due to the increased eligibility requirements will further reduce access to reproductive health services in the state.
“It is going to be devastating,” Nelson said. “The big fear is that people are not going to be receiving the life-saving cancer detections. They’re going to not have their STI treated, and people won’t be able to access birth control.
“You have an already stressed system and the amount of uncompensated care that’s going to be needed is going to be very taxing on the providers, not just Planned Parenthood, but across the board,” she said.
Maryland Health Benefit Exchange 
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said that the state insurance marketplaces, where people can shop for individual private insurance through the Affordable Care Act, fared better than originally anticipated under the budget reconciliation legislation — though it will also face challenges.
The legislation will create barriers for certain immigrants to purchase health care on the marketplace and receive tax credits to help bring monthly costs down for coverage. Some changes in Marketplace rules that were implemented outside of the budget reconciliation bill will also narrow the time that people can sign up for new health plans.
She is more worried about something that was absent from the legislation – an extension on the federal tax credits that have boosted enrollment through the exchange.
Insurers seek 17% hike in state marketplace premiums, amid ‘wild uncertainty’ at federal level

“We’ve had huge success in enrollments,” Eberle said of the federal tax credits.  “It makes it affordable for people to use their tax credit to pay for their health care that they’re purchasing in their own right.”
Insurance companies have already warned state officials that those who bought health insurance on the state marketplace could see the cost of coverage increase an average of 17% next year unless Congress extends those federal subsidies.
Eberle said that Congress still has time to act.
“It’s got to be solved or we’re going to lose enrollees — we know that,” she said.
Eberle warns that all of these factors together will likely reduce the size of the insurance pool, which could lead to increased costs for everyone, even those on private insurance through employers.
“That will effect, not only on the exchange, but off-exchange, individual marketplace,” she said. “That will affect the doctors that are providing those services, the hospitals where the people go. All of that trickle-down effect the small business employer who has lost coverage and now gets sick and can’t be at work – I mean all of those things.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Medicaid-checkin-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-11 10:06:34.522147

A proposed California law would turn down the volume,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/california-streaming-service-ad-volume/,"After his staffer’s baby was woken up by a loud ad on a streaming service, a California senator took action to force streamers to turn down the volume on commercials. The entertainment industry is fighting it.","In summary
After his staffer’s baby was woken up by a loud ad on a streaming service, a California senator took action to force streamers to turn down the volume on commercials. The entertainment industry is fighting it. 


Ever been streaming a show or a movie and been jolted out of your entertainment reverie by an ad so loud it felt like it rattled the windows?
If California’s lawmakers have their way, those blaring commercials on streaming platforms might soon have the volume turned down.
A bill sailing through the Legislature with bipartisan support would prohibit online streaming services like Netflix and Hulu from cranking up the volume during commercials. The proposal would make the platforms comply with the same standards as a 15-year-old federal law that limits how loud traditional television and cable broadcasters can make their advertisements.
Senate Bill 576 hasn’t been a very tough sell for its author, Democratic Sen. Tom Umberg of Santa Ana, despite opposition from California’s influential entertainment industry.
“This is the most popular bill I’ve introduced this year,” Umberg said in an interview with CalMatters.
Case in point: Every senator who was present that day voted for the bill when Umberg brought it to the Senate floor in late May. Umberg appealed to their annoyance.
“I’m guessing that all of you have been annoyed when you’re … streaming television, and a commercial comes on and it is exponentially louder than the other shows,” Umberg told his colleagues.
He glanced around the chamber. “You see heads nodding aye.”
President Barack Obama signed the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act in 2010, which gave the Federal Communications Commission authority to issue rules ensuring that the average volume of TV commercials does not exceed the volume of the programming they accompany, according to the bill’s analysis. It notes that streaming services were still nascent at the time. Members of Congress have since tried to add streaming platforms to the law, but two 2023 federal bills didn’t get hearings.
Umberg’s bill aims to make streaming services in California follow the same rules despite Congress not yet taking action.
But would it be legal for California to do so?
UC Berkeley Law Professor Tejas Narechania told CalMatters that federal courts have ruled “that the California Legislature could enact consumer protections aimed at California residents, even if they affected out-of-state content providers.”
Narechania cited a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of a California deaf-rights organization that sued CNN for violating state law by failing to put closed captioning on videos it had on its website.
Umberg: Don’t wake the baby! 
While a significant amount of legislation comes to lawmakers through lobbyists pitching their proposals, this one came to Umberg from a baby. Well, the baby’s parents anyway.  
He said his legislative director, Zach Keller, has an infant daughter named Samantha Rose. The baby had finally settled down to sleep and her parents, in turn, settled down to relax and watch a show when an ad came on so loud it woke the baby.
“Her father, at the behest of the baby’s mother, brought a bill idea to me,” Umberg said. “I thought, ‘That’s a good bill idea,’ so we introduced it.”
The plight of parents with sleeping babies hasn’t been enough to ward off opposition to the bill from California’s entertainment industry, including the Motion Picture Association of America. It has donated at least $204,000 to lawmakers since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 34 (Santa Ana)



Opponents, including the Streaming Innovation Alliance, argue that the proposal would be difficult for streaming services to implement. 
Streaming service ads don’t work the same way as commercials at cable and television networks, Melissa Patack, a representative for the Motion Picture Association, told the Assembly’s Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee last month.
“When you choose a program on your streaming service, you’re actually calling up a digital file and advertising is paired up with that in real time,” she said. “The streaming platform may not be able to control the loudness of a particular ad.”
Patack added that the streaming industry has done “a significant amount of work” already to “address loudness issues and develop best practices to match the loudness of ads with programming.”
Umberg isn’t buying it.“I have a great deal of faith in the entertainment industry, in the technology that they both currently use and are developing, that if they can make ads louder, they can make them less loud,” he said.
Umberg’s bill now moves to the Assembly floor where Umberg is again likely to appeal to lawmakers’ desire for streamers not to wake up more babies such as Samantha Rose",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070725_Toddler-TV_ISTOCK_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-11 09:07:59.748350
,California,2025-07-11 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California courts owe defendants a jury of their peers. It’s still too hard to get one,Denise Amos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/california-courts-jury-pay-peers/,California is ending an experiment to raise juror pay in seven counties. It would would have encouraged moderate-income people to serve and helped diversify juries.,"A San Diego man accused of murder went on trial for four weeks earlier this year. After closing arguments, the jurors — myself included — re-examined hundreds of photos of exhibits and re-listened to hours of testimony before finding the man guilty on most counts. 
Before we left the jury room, we dropped our anonymity and shared a little bit about ourselves. 
Some jurors were business owners or managers. One was a nurse. Two of us worked in news media. There was an interior decorator, an accountant, a researcher and a computer analyst. 
Almost everyone had attended or graduated college. White people made up about half the jury panel.
By contrast the defendant, a Latino man, had the equivalent of a high school education and had long been unemployed. Prosecutors painted him as a long-time drug abuser and dealer. He denied killing his nephew.
We considered him innocent, until the evidence proved him guilty. Yet as I rode down the courthouse escalator one last time, I couldn’t shake a nagging question: Were we really a jury of his peers? 
That wasn’t a rhetorical question. It’s especially germane now, because California lawmakers and the governor just killed an 8-month-old program that was supposed to help ensure more diverse jury pools so defendants could be judged by their peers. 
Courts have long interpreted the “jury of peers” standard to mean a jury “of equals,” taken randomly from a pool that includes “a broad spectrum of the population, particularly of race, national origin and gender,” according to Law.com’s online legal dictionary.
But while about 9 out of 10 defendants nationwide are too poor to afford lawyers, most jurors aren’t in that low of an income bracket. I discovered that firsthand. And for decades, prosecutors have used so-called peremptory challenges — challenges that don’t need a cause — to manipulate the makeup of juries. 
Public defenders say this forces even innocent clients to take plea bargains, rather than face a jury that doesn’t look like them. That isn’t justice.
Even some California prosecutors acknowledge that the courts would be fairer with more diverse jury panels. Yet the state is backing away from a common sense strategy to fix that. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom recently axed $27.5 million from the state budget that funded a two-year pilot program paying $100 a day to jurors serving in Alameda, El Dorado, Fresno, Imperial, Monterey, San Bernardino and Shasta counties. 
The seven counties are part of a study. Supporters were hoping that higher juror pay would spread throughout California, but lawmakers haven’t put a penny toward it in next year’s budget. 
California courts currently pay jurors $15 a day. The idea behind the experimental raise, which Newsom signed into law in 2022, was to test whether better pay leads to more racially and economically diverse juries.
It was modeled after a similar program started in San Francisco in 2021 that increased pay to $100 for lower-income jurors. After one year, more than 8 in 10 program participants said they wouldn’t have been able to serve on a jury without that money. 
It sure would have made a difference in the jury selection I was a part of. 
Picking a jury when there’s ‘undue hardship’
For the San Diego murder trial, the judge called in a jury pool of nearly 110 people. He explained that it takes that many people and two full days to eventually select 12 jurors and four alternates for a criminal case expected to last several weeks. 
Some prospective jurors won’t serve because of “undue hardship,” he said. Too many employers are refusing to pay workers on jury duty. California law says employers can’t fire workers serving on juries, but it doesn’t make employers pay them. 
That’s why California consistently fills juries with retirees or people who work in white-collar jobs or who have the money to go without pay. Equal justice is just an empty promise if a minimum wage worker earns eight times more than jurors make in a day.
Add to that, a juror’s expenses can easily outstrip the daily pay. In San Diego, jurors who drove had to pay to park —- that’s $25 to $40 a day — and pay for lunch, which ran about $20 at nearby restaurants. I rode the trolley and packed lunch to save money.
During my first two days of jury duty, people described their financial hardship. One young man told the judge — in front of everyone — that he had been unemployed for months and was still looking for work. A woman complained she couldn’t afford several weeks of child care. Another man was unsure he’d keep his job beyond two weeks on jury duty. 
None of them were picked for the jury.
Besides finances, certain life experiences can be factors in shaping a jury. In this trial, the 108-member jury pool was given a 75-question survey designed to identify bias.
Some questions made me suspect I might be disqualified, like the question about whether I or a family member had been a victim of a crime. Yes, my mother was violently mugged years ago, I wrote, and the police didn’t arrest anyone. 
I answered ‘yes’ to a question about whether anyone in my family had been arrested. When my brother was a preteen, he got caught entering an abandoned factory with friends. He took a plea deal and stayed out of jail, but knowing how few Black boys got breaks, I was terrified for him, I wrote.
While scribbling my answers I wondered how many other juror candidates had similar responses? Would negative experiences with police make us unsuitable? 
There were other, more obvious potential disqualifiers: I’m a Black woman, so a lawyer might assume I don’t trust police or the courts. And I’m a journalist, a profession often excluded from juries for various reasons.
Read More: Another California professional group wants a free pass from jury duty. This lawmaker says noI was surprised at how many held that view. But a woman next to me whispered that they weren’t all taking principled stands; some just thought it might get them out of jury duty. 
After reading the questionnaires, the judge interrogated us. By the time he got to me, about a dozen people — including several white people — told the judge that they were not confident a person of color could get a fair shake in the legal system. 
The judge grilled me about my family’s encounters with police. He asked point-blank if I thought my brother was treated fairly by the court. I told him that since my brother didn’t have to serve jail time, maybe he was.
I guess my answer was acceptable. When the judge empaneled the jurors and sent the rest home, I was the last juror selected.
The right to a jury trial is so vital that it’s spelled out in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. But seeking a jury of peers does not mean that male defendants will only be tried by men, or Asians by Asians, or African Americans by African Americans. It does mean a court cannot intentionally exclude someone because of race or gender.
To me that doesn’t go far enough. California should make it easier for jurors to serve, especially those who come from the world the defendant lives in.
If it costs California $27 million to try to reach that standard in seven counties, it’s worth it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/013005_Jury-Box-Santa-Maria_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-11 09:07:59.748350

Aside from giving housing and homelessness its own box atop Gov. Gavin Newsom’s organizational chart, the reorg is supposed to simplify the state’s snarled affordable housing financing system.


After years of soaring rents, increasingly out-of-reach home prices and an enduring homelessness crisis that touches every corner of the state, California is finally creating a state agency exclusively focused on housing issues.
You might wonder what took so long.
Earlier this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced a proposal to split up the Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency — an awkward grabbag of disparate bureaucratic operations — into two fresh agencies: One just for housing and homelessness-related departments and one for everything else. 
The Legislature had until July 4 to veto the plan. It didn’t (though some Republicans tried). Now the work of standing up California’s first housing agency begins. 
Supporters of the bureaucratic reshuffle say the move is long overdue. In surveys, Californians regularly name housing costs and homelessness as among the state’s top concerns. That alone warrants the creation of a new cabinet-level adviser to the governor, said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing development.
“A cabinet-level secretary who will sit with other cabinet secretaries, whose purview will be housing … that is elevating the agenda to the highest level,” he said.
Pearl, like virtually every expert interviewed for this article about the new agency, described the reorganization as “just the first step” in bringing much-needed order and efficiency to California’s network of funding programs for affordable housing. 
“Simply moving people around and giving them a new business card doesn’t change the system,” he said.
A spokesperson for the governor stressed that the creation of a new housing agency is part of a broader effort by Newsom to prioritize one of California’s most vexing issues. Since taking the helm of state government in 2018, the governor has ramped up pressure on local governments to plan for more housing, urged them to clear encampments of unhoused Californians and pushed for legislation aimed at ramping up construction.
“This is the first administration to make this a part of our everyday conversation — putting a magnifying glass on the issue of homelessness and finding ways to effectively address it. These structural and policy changes are going to create a generational impact,” said spokesperson Tara Gallegos.
Among the seven cabinet-level agencies, the BCSH has always seemed like the “everything else” wing of state government. Affordable housing grantmakers, lenders and urban planning regulators share agency letterhead with cannabis and alcohol industry overseers, professional licensors, car mechanic watchdogs and everyone at the California Horse Racing Board. 
“We used to call it ‘The Island of Misfit Toys,’” said Claudia Cappio, who ran both the California Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Community Development in the years immediately before and after 2012 when both were packed into the newly created BCSH. “Imagine a staff meeting of all those things … I learned a lot about horse racing.” 
How many financing systems is too many?
Aside from giving housing and homelessness its own box atop Newsom’s organizational chart, the chief selling point of the reorganization has been to simplify the state’s hydra of affordable housing financing systems. 
Currently, there is one state organization where affordable housing developers apply for loans, another where they go for most grants, a third where they apply for the federal tax credits that builders use to entice private investors to back their projects and a fourth for the bonds needed to secure many of those credits. This doesn’t include one-off programs for veterans, transit-oriented development and short-term housing for homeless people, which are sprinkled across state government. 
Complicating things further, the tax credit and bond funding programs — the backbone of funding for affordable housing development across the country — aren’t even under the governor’s control. Those programs are run by the state’s independently elected treasurer.
“Many, many states have what is essentially a housing finance agency that controls the majority of affordable housing funds,” said Sarah Karlinsky, who directs research at UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation. California’s programs are split up, which is unusual. 
Beyond that, “what makes California so unique,” said Karlinksy, “is the fact that the resources are spread across two different constitutional officers.”
That fragmentation appears to be adding to the cost of construction in California. A Terner Center analysis this spring estimated that each additional public funding source delays a project by, on average, four months, and adds an additional $20,460 in costs per unit. 
Affordable housing construction is already distinctly expensive here. Building a publicly funded project in California costs more than 2.5 times more per square foot than in both Texas and Colorado, a recent report from the Rand Institute found.
The dance of secretaries
Will the new housing agency solve that problem? Not everyone is convinced.
Of the many ways in which the scarcity of affordable housing affects most people, “the lines on the org chart” don’t crack the “top 100 list,”  Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat, said about the governor’s proposal at a hearing in March. 
Cabaldon noted that executive reorganizations are a semi-regular feature of California governance. The Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency is itself the product of a reorganization which spun off California’s independent transportation agency.  
“The dance of the secretaries we do constantly, always with grand ambitions,” said Cabaldon. “Simply saying that it’s going to cause more focus, that it will be streamlined, that it will cause leadership level action — but how?”
As written, the new housing agency will consist of the current agency’s housing-related entities along with a new Affordable Housing Finance Committee, which will be tasked with coordinating the housing subsidy programs currently under the governor’s control. 
But the major funding sources managed by the treasurer’s office will remain where they are. The California constitution wouldn’t have allowed Newsom to commandeer those functions from the independent treasurer even had he wanted to.
That’s a significant shortcoming, according to the Little Hoover Commission, the state government’s independent oversight agency, which reviewed the governor’s plan before it was passed along to the Legislature. In its final report, the commission recommended that the governor and treasurer strike a formal deal to “create a unified application and review process” for all the affordable finance programs under their respective purviews.  
Neither the governor’s office nor the office of state Treasurer Fiona Ma would say if or how they are pursuing that goal.
A single, unified application for every one of California’s public affordable housing funding programs has been the bureaucratic holy grail of California affordable developers and policy wonks since at least the mid-1990s. Though the reorganization stops short of requiring that, it set up both constitutional offices to better coordinate in the future, said Matt Schwartz, president of the California Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing.
“There’s going to be a bit of diplomacy” between the two executive branches to work out a joint application, said Schwartz, who spoke to CalMatters earlier this year after the governor first introduced the proposal. “That’s the longer-term prize that many of us will be pushing to come out of this process.”
Some affordable housing advocates have urged lawmakers to be cautious in mushing the various bureaucracies together.
In a letter to four powerful Democratic legislators, the California Housing Consortium stressed that the application systems administered by the treasurer’s office already “function extremely well.” 
That process “is not broken and doesn’t need fixing,” said Pearl, the consortium’s director. Before monkeying with it, he said, “let’s get the agency set up.”
Pearl and the consortium also noted that past legislation has already mandated the creation of a working group to propose a consolidated application. The findings of that group are due on July 1, 2026. That’s the same day the current BCSH is set to officially dissolve and the two new agencies will take its place. 
That’s also just five months before statewide elections will be held to replace Newsom and Ma, giving voters a chance to decide who will shape the future of affordable housing policy in California.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HOUSING-ORG_AH_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-11 09:07:59.748350

Can California candidates replicate his success?,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/california-progressives-zohran-mamdani/,"California progressives, who have long struggled for influence, hope to break through to mainstream voters by challenging the establishment and rejecting corporate spending.","In summary
California progressives, who have long struggled for influence, hope to break through to mainstream voters by challenging the establishment and rejecting corporate spending.


For California progressives, Zohran Mamdani’s New York City mayoral bid offers something of a formula to follow.
When the 33-year-old democratic socialist pulled off a historic upset in the primary last month, Golden State progressives rejoiced. Some deemed his victory a sign that they do not need to pivot to the center to resonate with voters as many California leaders have in recent years.
“It gets people to say … ‘Maybe I can actually be myself and do this,’” said Neel Sannappa, chair of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus and an organizer with the Working Families Party, which supports universal health care, the Green New Deal and taxing the rich.
Mamdani is young and charismatic. He chatted people up in the streets with an army of volunteers, drew a cult following with young voters and built a solid base among middle- and upper-class progressives. It helped that his main opponent, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was embroiled in sexual harassment allegations. 
But Mamdani’s victory may be much harder to replicate in California, where progressives have had some success — like when U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont won California handily in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary — but have struggled to fully break through.
“Do I see a Mamdani-like election somewhere in 2026 here in California? Potentially,” said Michael Trujillo, a Democratic strategist who worked on former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa’s campaigns and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
“But if that person exists, they haven’t emerged yet.”
Over the years, California progressives have failed to gain more influence within the state Democratic Party. Voters have rejected left-leaning ballot measures and progressive legislation has stalled. Fueled by frustration over crime and homelessness, voters have recalled progressive district attorneys and elected moderate local leaders.
California progressives who spoke to CalMatters primarily faulted their lack of success on the political influence of corporations, arguing that special interests have spent big to elbow out left-wing Democrats. They pointed to Sacramento’s mayoral race last November, where business-backed Democrat Kevin McCarty defeated his left-leaning opponent Flo Cofer after outspending her two-to-one. Nationwide, progressive members of Congress such as Cori Bush of Missouri and Jamaal Bowman of New York lost to well-funded primary opponents.
The sheer vastness of California also makes it hard to mount effective door-knocking campaigns like Mamdani’s. 
“There’s no doubt that Zohran is a unicorn,” said Jane Kim, head of the Working Families Party in California. “There are unicorns that break out that are able to fly at an altitude that’s very hard for us to reach.”
But progressive strategists and candidates argue that Mamdani’s victory demonstrates a desire for a departure from the establishment. They argue that there is a path to victory if they present themselves as agents of change and craft relatable messages that resonate with the working class, especially on affordability.

“(Mamdani) made the campaign not about progressive vs. moderate. He made it about change vs. the status quo,” said Saikat Chakrabarti, a progressive seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco next year.  He is the former chief of staff to progressive U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
“People are sick of the status quo,” he said. “I’m the change candidate.”
Changing the electorate
The California electorate, though relatively liberal compared to other states, is not as liberal as portrayed nationwide and has shifted rightward in recent years, said Christian Grose, political science professor at the University of Southern California. 
Just last year, Californians embraced tougher penalties for petty crimes, elected leaders promising harder crackdown on homelessness and rejected progressive policies aiming to rein in rent increases, end forced prison labor and increase the minimum wage. 
“Progressives and Democrats and Republicans would all be very foolish not to be courting the youth vote. The problem is that they all do a generally pretty bad job.”Mindy Romero, founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California
“Even the most progressive or socialist Democrats, if they want to win statewide, they have to reach all those coalition groups in the Democratic electorate, some of which are very progressive and some of which are not,” Grose said.
While much of California’s population is renters and aspiring homeowners, its voters are skewed heavily toward older homeowners, who could view things like rent control and social housing as threats to their quality of life, Grose noted. Homeowners account for almost 70% of likely voters, whereas renters account for only 30%, according to a Public Policy Institute of California survey. 
“One path for progressives to win would actually be to change the electorate, to get more renters to turn out, to get more young people to turn out,” Grose said.
That’s what Mamdani sought to do in New York City, and data suggest he succeeded, beating Cuomo in neighborhoods with more young people, many of whom said they liked his affordability policies. As the city pondered rent increases, Mamdani ran on a platform of freezing rent and creating more affordable housing and won 46% of the vote in renter-heavy neighborhoods, Bloomberg reported. 
“Progressives and Democrats and Republicans would all be very foolish not to be courting the youth vote. The problem is that they all do a generally pretty bad job of courting the youth vote,” said Mindy Romero, founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California. 
Following the November election, California’s young Democrats expressed frustration that their party isn’t doing enough to resonate with their peers, arguing that candidates should take progressive stances on issues such as the war in Gaza and transgender rights, focus on reaching young people on social media and campuses and simplify their affordability message.
“It can’t be an afterthought,” Romero said. 
Anti-corporate messaging
Many who spoke to CalMatters hope their firm stance against accepting money from corporate donors will resonate. More than half of California voters “strongly agree” that special interest money has too much sway in state politics, according to a poll released Thursday by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Though affiliated with the Working Families Party, Randy Villegas, who is challenging GOP U.S. Rep. David Valadao in the swing 22nd Congressional District, hesitates to call himself a progressive. The district is one where only moderate Democrats have managed to come close to victory in the past decade. 
Instead, Villegas said his path to victory lies in his “economic populist,” anti-wealthy message that focuses on making life easier for the working class. Villegas has sworn off corporate political action committee money, a gesture of authenticity that Sannappa said corporate-backed Democrats do not share.
“You are not having to curtail what you say because some donor that gave you $2,700 in Beverly Hills thinks this certain way about this certain thing,” he said.
“We cannot claim to champion the working class … if we are receiving money from the same corporate PACs that Republicans are receiving money from,” Villegas said. 
But Romero said that messaging mostly works with voters who are already aligned with the candidate.
“Not everybody agrees corporate money is bad. They need to be shown exactly what that means for their pocket book, for their family’s well being, or their family’s safety,” Romero said.

And while Democrats widely use the anti-corporate PAC pledge to signal their willingness to stand up to special interests, that promise still allows them to accept other corporate dollars, such as contributions from executives or trade groups. 
When asked whether the party would change its approach to accepting corporate donations or shift to the left to address progressives, California Democratic Party Chairperson Rusty Hicks did not address his party’s plans. 
“The California Democratic Party has been and will continue to be home to the diverse voices that best represent the Golden State,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “California Democrats are squarely focused on delivering for all Californians – in the halls of government, in places of work and in every community. That’s what voters are expecting of us. And we aim to deliver.” 
Will Trump provide the momentum?
Progressives in California are hoping that President Donald Trump, who has executed much more sweeping immigration and economic policies than in his first term, drives voters toward “bold,” left-wing candidates. 
“It becomes this populist opportunity to really frame the economy in a way that works for working people and not for the more moderate problem solvers … that tend to be a lot more pro-business,” said Danielle Cendejas, a progressive consultant in Los Angeles. 
But it is not a given that progressives would receive a greater boost than other Democrats, Grose said.
“I think it’s more about someone who can effectively take on Trump,” he said. “The politics is secondary.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/060425_Zohran-Mamdan_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-11 09:07:59.748350

(John Gray/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – A controversial new state law that creates criminal penalties for local law enforcement officers who do not fully cooperate with federal immigration investigations is set to go into effect next month, putting the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office in a legal quagmire.
For more than a decade, under a legal settlement in a federal civil rights case, the sheriff’s office, which runs the New Orleans jail, has maintained a policy that places tight restrictions on how its employees can interact with federal immigration authorities.
But beginning on Aug. 1, under Act 399 of 2025, Orleans Parish deputies who follow that policy could be charged with committing a felony and face up to 10 years in prison. On the other hand, if the sheriff’s office goes against the policy and obeys the new state law, it risks violating a longstanding federal court settlement.
Will Harrell, senior program monitor for Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, said the agency already collaborates with U.S. immigration and Customs Enforcement in ways that do not violate that court order — also known as a consent decree. In a phone interview Wednesday, he said the agency is constitutionally obligated to stay the course.
“To the extent that the consent decree allows, we will cooperate with the [new] law. We already do,” Harrell said, noting that the settlement was signed and ordered in place by a federal judge. The U.S. Constitution gives federal law precedence over conflicting state law. “We feel that the proper position is to maintain our compliance with the consent decree.”

The sheriff’s office’s immigration policy — enacted in 2013 by then-Sheriff Marlin Gusman — prohibits Sheriff’s Office deputies from initiating investigations into detainees’ immigration statuses and blocks the office from honoring most “detainer” requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
When ICE makes a detainer request for a jail inmate, local jailers are authorized to hold that person in jail for a short period past their release date, without a court order. But honoring such requests is voluntary under federal law. And in most cases — other than those where the subject of the request is facing particularly serious charges — it is prohibited by the sheriff’s office’s policy.
The policy was adopted as part of a federal court settlement in a 2011 civil rights case. At the time, the sheriff’s office accepted detainer requests. But according to the suit, it went beyond what federal law allowed.  Two Hispanic construction workers alleged in the suit that after being picked up on minor charges, they were illegally held in the city’s jail at ICE’s request for months beyond their release dates, well beyond the 48 hours federal law allows for immigration detainers.
When he adopted the policy, bringing the suit to a close, Gusman said it would allow his office to “cooperate with ICE, provided specific procedures are followed” and that it was consistent with the provisions of another, much broader federal consent decree — meant to bring the long-troubled jail up to constitutional standards — that was adopted the same year.
But the state has recently sought to undo the policy by reopening the 2011 civil rights case that led to it.
In February, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill requested that the state become a party in the federal case that yielded the policy, in an effort to get the OPSO’s immigration policy thrown out.
A federal judge has not yet decided if she will grant or deny the state’s request to intervene in the case. Harrell said until the judge makes that call, the agency is bound by the original consent judgement.
“If the consent decree goes away then we have no choice but to cooperate with ICE in all cases of detainers and we will do that,” Harrell said
Landry, a conservative immigration hardliner and ally of President Donald Trump, and other top Republicans in the state have long sought to end so-called “sanctuary” policies adopted by local governments, specifically targeting the sheriff’s office’s policy and a similar immigration policy adopted by the New Orleans Police Department in 2016 as part of its own long-running federal consent decree.
Last year, the Louisiana Legislature, with Landry’s support, passed Act 314, which prohibits government agencies from adopting or maintaining so-called “sanctuary” policies, taking aim at the OPSO policy. When that law’s passed, officials in Hutson’s office said that the agency would continue to comply with the federal consent judgement.
The newly passed law, Act 399, takes things a step further. Act 314 is a civil law, enforceable by court order and carrying no jail time for violations. Act 399, on the other hand, is a criminal law. Under the law as written, sheriff’s office employees who refuse ICE detainer requests face felony charges of malfeasance in office, which carries a potential 10-year sentence in prison.
The new law also adds to the crime of obstruction of justice, making it a misdemeanor to “knowingly … hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts.” Under the change members of the public can face up to a year in jail. Immigrant and civil rights advocates have called the language in the law vague.
Bruce Reilly, deputy director of New Orleans criminal justice reform group Voice Of The Experienced, called the new law an example of government “overreach.”
“I think the legal question may be, ‘Can the state pass a law that forces people to be deputized by federal agencies?’” Reilly said.

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.

While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.

Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”

In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Birgitta Meade, Northeast Iowa retired science teacher


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

(Courtesy of the Utah Hospital Association)Kane County Hospital, in Kanab, is one of the state’s most remote hospitals. It’s the furthest south, close to the Arizona border, and it’s more than an hour away from St. George, the nearest major city in the state. 
Though it will likely take years for the full ramifications of the slashes to Medicaid benefits and other health care spending cuts included in congressional Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” to come to fruition, Utah Hospital Association officials are concerned about what they could mean for the state’s health care system. In particular, they worry about rural hospitals, like the one in Kanab. 
Matthew McCollough, rural hospital improvement director for the Utah Hospital Association, posed a hypothetical. 
“Worst case scenario, they have to reduce services and they get rid of labor and delivery, and they close their maternity services,” he said, which he noted is usually the first service to “get cut, because it’s not a revenue generating service.” 
‘Lives are at stake,’ health, food aid advocates say of Medicaid, SNAP cuts in ‘big, beautiful bill’

So if labor and delivery services get cut, expecting mothers in that area would then have to drive more than an hour to St. George to the nearest hospital equipped to deliver their babies. 
“An hour is an eternity if you’re going into labor,” McCollough said. 
Kanab’s not alone. “A lot of communities in Utah, if they lost their hospital, they’re looking at an hour drive to the next location for emergency care,” he said. 
For those living along the Wasatch Front, imagine needing to drive up to Logan to get to the nearest emergency room. 
“That’s the kind of real world impact,” he said. “Health care isn’t about hospital finances. It’s about caring for people.”
Earlier this week after the megabill’s passage, the Utah Hospital Association issued a prepared statement warning of the bill’s impacts to hospitals’ ability to deliver quality care without increasing prices. 
“While we support efforts to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicaid system, we are deeply concerned about the magnitude of the Medicaid cuts included in this legislation,” the Utah Hospital Association said.
“These cuts will significantly impact the ability of Utah hospitals to deliver high-quality care in our communities and to keep healthcare costs down for patients,” the association continued. “We are disappointed that the Senate’s proposed reductions were ultimately signed into law. The result will likely be reduced access to care, higher insurance costs, and increased pressure on Utah’s state budget.”

The megabill pushed by President Donald Trump included about $1 trillion in total Medicaid cuts over 10 years, according to KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization. That could result in a $4 billion to $7 billion loss in federal dollars for Utah, according to that analysis. 
However, that analysis did not include the $50 billion provision that was added into the bill to create the Rural Health Transformation Program to provide state grants meant to help offset the impacts to rural hospitals. McCollough said that could help — the program is expected to provide about $100 million to Utah each year for five years — but it won’t fully offset the cuts. And it also depends on how Utah lawmakers decide to divvy up those funds.

A separate analysis by KFF estimated federal Medicaid spending in rural areas across the country is estimated to decrease by $155 billion over 10 years. In Utah, KFF estimated a total loss of $872 million in that time period. 
While that’s a significant number, it pales in comparison to other states that have larger rural populations. Kentucky, for example, is expected to see the most dramatic decline, at an estimated drop of $12 billion. 
Impact to rural hospitals
Rural hospitals, in particular, are expected to be hit the hardest. 
“Rural communities have a higher proportion of their population that are on Medicaid,” McCollough said. “But, you know, these people are our farmers and ranchers. They grow our food, produce our energy. And they rely on Medicaid, and the hospitals and clinics that serve on them rely on Medicaid to pay them for the services they provide.” 
Utah has 21 rural hospitals. Of those, 13 are “critical access hospitals,” meaning they’re designated by Medicare to ensure health care access in remote areas. To have that status, they must have no more than 25 inpatient beds, be located at least 35 miles from other hospitals, and provide 24/7 emergency care. 
Of Utah’s 21 rural hospitals, nine are also known as the “Rural 9,” or part of the Utah Rural Independent Hospital Network, a nonprofit that formed to help financially stabilize those hospitals and improve their care in rural areas. All of Utah’s other rural hospitals are part of Intermountain Health’s larger network, which helps keep them financially secure.

Those not part of Intermountain Health’s network, like the “Rural 9,” said McCollough (who is also the network’s director), are likely the most at risk of losing services due to Medicaid cuts — though he emphasized that it’s not all “doom and gloom” for several reasons. 
First of all, he said, “there’s no panic,” among rural hospitals right now because the cuts are not “immediate.” Hospital officials are concerned, he said, but it will likely take three to five years for the cuts to take effect and show their “real toll on hospitals.”
Second, Utah’s rural hospitals are generally in better financial positions than many in other states. 
Even before the “big, beautiful bill’s” passage, more than 700 rural U.S. hospitals — one-third of all of rural hospitals in the country — were at risk of closure due to “serious financial problems,” according to an analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. At the time, Utah had zero hospitals at risk of closure as of June 2025, though it did have six that reported losses on services, according to that report. 
But now that Trump has signed the “big, beautiful bill” into law, state officials are still unpacking its impacts to Utah’s hospitals, and it’s not yet clear exactly how much revenue Utah hospitals will lose due to the Medicaid cuts and other provisions in the bill. 
“We really don’t know yet,” McCollough said, adding that the Utah Hospital Association is trying to come up with a “model” to project what the impact will be hospital by hospital. He noted that those figures will likely depend on what Utah lawmakers decide to do with the state’s Medicaid programs in reaction to the cuts. 
However, because of the sheer size of the federal cuts, he said it’s likely to mean a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars for Utah hospitals.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

How will Utah lawmakers react?
Until Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature decides how to handle the billions lost federal Medicaid dollars, it’s not yet clear exactly how many people will lose coverage and how much revenue will be lost for hospitals. 
However, according to a report issued by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee’s Democratic staff, the bill puts at estimated 188,494 people in Utah at risk of losing coverage. That number goes up to 237,370 if Utah leaders decide to allow a trigger law to go into effect that ends the state’s Medicaid expansion program if the federal matching percentage is reduced. 
There’s a long list of tough questions facing lawmakers now. Is Utah going to keep its Medicaid expansion program? Given the cuts, how will the state continue to fund its program? Who will continue to receive Medicaid coverage — and who won’t? And for hospitals, how will the state’s reimbursement rate for Medicaid change? 
Spokespeople for both the state’s House and Senate Republican majority told Utah News Dispatch this week it’s too soon to provide answers to those questions. 
“Senators are working with Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services to review the bill to understand its implications and proposed changes,” said Aundrea Peterson, deputy chief of staff for the Utah Senate majority. “Until there has been a more thorough review, it would be premature to provide answers.”
“We are only beginning to understand the full impact of these changes, and we expect to have a clearer picture in the coming months,” said Alexa Musselman, the House majority’s director of strategic communications, in a text to Utah News Dispatch. “That said, we fully support implementing a work requirement as a condition for receiving government assistance.”
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

In anticipation of the Trump’ administration’s appetite to impose work requirements on Medicaid, Utah state officials had already started drafting a new waiver to implement those requirements on Utah’s adult Medicaid expansion recipients — months before the “big, beautiful bill’s” passage. That waiver was submitted July 3, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, and awaits consideration by federal officials. 
However, the megabill’s cuts to Medicaid go far further than that waiver, and lawmakers will likely need to start dealing with its ramifications in a legislative session. That could be a special session this fall — or lawmakers may choose to wait until their general session in January. 
Until those decisions are made, a cloud of uncertainty hovers over the future of Utah’s Medicaid programs. But one thing’s for certain: there will be a big hole in federal revenue that lawmakers will either need to find a way to fill or allow it to fall away.

(Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)The director of the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission (ACVCC) said Thursday the commission has nearly cleared a backlog of claims that led to protests by nonprofit groups and the first direct legislative appropriations to the commission in its four-decade history.
Everette Johnson, the executive director of the ACVCC, said at a meeting of the commission Thursday that it had completely caught up on a backlog that had run to 1,900 cases when he took over in 2023. 
“We just drew a line in the sand and said ‘We’ll bring the retirees to handle the old stuff, and then our current staff will take care of anything new coming in and that way we stay up to date,’” he said.
Johnson said during the period of backlogs, the commission was averaging anywhere between 100 to 120 applications a month being filed on top of the backlogged claims. Now, he said, there about 260 cases remaining, all due to filers having a felony conviction waiting to be adjudicated.
Muaath Al-Khattab, a Montgomery hub community organizer for Faith in Action Alabama, which worked with applicants to process claims, said Thursday the organization is happy the case backlog has been reduced.
“We like to try as much as we can to keep a good working relationship with the commission and hold them accountable, but also be supportive of what they’ve done going forward to help victims,” he said.
The Alabama Legislature created the ACVCC in 1984 to provide financial aid to victims of crime and their families. The commission offers payments for funerals, emergencies, and medical or counseling costs. 
But the ACVCC struggled to meet applications as revenue from fines and fees, its chief source of income, began falling. Applicants found themselves waiting a year or more for responses to applications. After protests from applicants and groups working with them, the Alabama Legislature in 2023 directly appropriated $1.5 million to the commission to help it clear the backlog. The governor’s office allocated another $1 million to it.
ACVCC has been receiving fewer applications than they typically have this quarter, Johnson said Thursday. Between May and June there were only about 70 applications submitted, he said.
“Our applications have decreased this past year which is troublesome, but that’s not in our control,” Johnson said.
Johnson said there was no particular reason for the lack of applications submitted and said ACVCC does victim service outreach to let victims know they can receive compensation.
“We see violent crime happening in our communities every day around the state, so we’re hoping that we’re able to make contact with these victims to make sure they know help is available to them,” Johnson said.
The new funds will also go towards increasing payout caps for victims which Johnson said were decreased due to funding cuts in previous years.
“We’re not completely there, but we’ll be able to hopefully release some more money to help victims that we’ve stymied because of the lack of funding,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Flashing-lights-on-a-police-car-for-Feb-4-2025-story-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 08:08:29.684277

Menino’s steadfast commitment to the convention center stands as an unparalleled success in the history of the city. With its naming in his honor, the lifelong Hyde Park resident, who for years was vexed by smoother-talking critics with prestigious pedigrees, will have his place in history cemented. 
The post With convention center naming, Menino gets his d[...]","MAYOR TOM MENINO, James Rooney, then the executive director of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, and I rode the escalator of the newly opened facility on an early visit to the convention in 2004. Rooney provided an upbeat report to Menino on its progress, and the mayor basked in the early signs of success. 
Not bad, he seemed to be saying as his powerful hands gestured to the impressive scene in front on him.
At that moment, the mayor turned to me with a question. “What was it, they said this would be?” he asked, motioning to the crowds amid the freshly constructed surroundings. “What do you mean, mayor?” I answered, not knowing where the question was going. He said, “You know, the white, the white elephant…”  
It had been axiomatic in that era before its opening to deride the convention center as a bloated, expensive megaproject. I quickly understood where he was going with the comment. After all, only a few years earlier I had written my own piece in the now-defunct Boston Phoenix criticizing the project along similar grounds.  
“Yes, mayor, a white elephant. They were all wrong on that one, including me. You were right,” I said. 
Now, as members of his family, old supporters, loyal former staffers, and state and city leaders prepare to gather at the convention center to unveil its new name, the Thomas Michael Menino Convention & Exhibition Center, the proof is in the pudding.  
Menino’s steadfast commitment to the convention center stands as an unparalleled success in the history of the city. The lifelong Hyde Park resident, who for years was vexed by smoother-talking critics with prestigious pedigrees, will have his place in history cemented. 
Menino championed the idea that the construction of the convention center would spark the growth of an entirely new neighborhood – one that would draw international business, company headquarters, and vibrant places to live, work, and gather. While skeptics scoffed, he held the line – and proved the doubters wrong.  
While the convention center and the Seaport (including the portion we now know as the Innovation District) comprise part of Menino’s legacy, they are by no means the only part. If anything, the center of his focus lay in the neighborhoods where the city’s residents lived.  
While, by now, his tireless focus on city services is part of the common Menino lore (and, yes, it’s absolutely true that he would place calls to City Hall to urge staff to fix the plantings, say, on Columbia Road on his way into the city), imagination and vision played an important role here too. 
While still a city councilor, Menino participated in events sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Through the National Trust, he learned about the Main Street program, which at that time was designed to help rural small towns preserve their historic identity. Menino thought to employ this program in city neighborhoods. The first urban Main Street was in Roslindale Village, a concept since emulated throughout Boston and in other American cities. The use of the program is thought to have been essential in preserving and promoting business in these neighborhoods, which it, in turn, helped revitalize.  
Perhaps Menino’s most significant legacy lay in his deep connection with the people of Boston. By 2014, a Boston Globe poll found that more than 57 percent of city residents had actually met him.  
Menino remained relentlessly focused on connecting with residents. He and his staff had to devise a litany of opportunities to make this happen: coffee hours in parks, new homeowner gatherings at neighborhood eateries, and meet-and-greets at farmers’ markets.  
Perhaps the most time-consuming but rewarding of these was the school awards. Every spring, the mayor’s office scheduled the school awards at Faneuil Hall. Every school had its allotted time, and each class had two winners: an academic awardee and a spirit honoree. Each of those awardees – and their families – posed for a photo with the mayor in turn. Those two hours were off-limits, and I was not permitted to interrupt him with media inquiries during that time, though I tried. 
This was more than politics. This was Menino’s way of showing the school staff, and most importantly, the students, that they mattered. 
I’m sure some of these honorees will be among the more than 700 attendees who will be at the convention center to pay tribute one last time to the man who led Boston for two decades, to show him and his family that he mattered too. 
Seth Gitell served as press secretary to Mayor Tom Menino from 2003-2006.

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy is all in on Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s gubernatorial bid, which could help her win Detroit in the 2026 primary – but maybe not so much in the general election with the city’s popular mayor on the ballot as an independent candidate.
Worthy announced her endorsement of Benson on Thursday, adding to a long list of supporters as she remains the frontrunner in the Democratic Party primary. She touted Benson’s grit and experience, but also her heart and vision for the state.
“[Benson] came to Detroit to make a difference as a civil rights advocate clerking for Judge Damon Keith, then transformed Wayne State Law School, leading the school from the bottom tier to the Top 50,” Worthy said. “We’ve seen what happens when leaders prioritize political survival or corporate interests over community needs. Jocelyn won’t play it safe. She’ll go toe-to-toe with anyone who threatens our hard earned rights and stand up for working families in Wayne County and across Michigan.”
Worthy went on to say that Benson’s plan puts people first, most of all those “who’ve been ignored or left behind for too long.”
“Jocelyn has what it takes to win, and more importantly, she has what it takes to govern with moral courage,” Worthy said.
Benson on social media thanked Worthy for her support, saying she has worked alongside her and admired the prosecutor for years.
“Prosecutor Worthy has always led with moral courage and integrity,” Benson said. “Her belief in our campaign and our shared vision for a Michigan where every community can thrive means so much to me. Together we’ll fight for a state where rights are protected, families are supported, and everyone can thrive.”
The longtime prosecutor’s support could undoubtedly help Benson’s chances among voters in the Democratic stronghold of the Motor City, but it was significant for another reason. Worthy did not endorse the other Detroit and Wayne County resident on the Democratic side of the race, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II.
It also signals that Benson is trying to build a coalition that could win in diverse parts of the state where Democrats also carry weight. 
A big win in Detroit for one of the primary candidates, including Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, could be a key brick in the path to victory when the August contest arrives next year.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Andrea Bitely, a political consultant and the owner of Bitely Communications, said Worthy’s endorsement of Benson makes sense because they are both attorneys who likely run in the same social circles and are women in significant leadership positions.
That said, Bitely noted that a strong Detroit showing in August 2026 might not matter much months later in the general election because of one very specific reason: Mike Duggan.
Bitely said there was no doubt the city would show up for Duggan even though he left the Democratic Party to seek the high office as an independent candidate – and one who tore at both Democrats’ and Republicans’ heels when he announced his intentions.
Duggan’s place in the city’s political zeitgeist wasn’t just a problem for Benson, it was something that both Gilchrist and Swanson have to grapple with if one ends up being the eventual nominee.
“Democrats have long been the winners in the city of Detroit, but the way that Mike Duggan is talking is really representative of the way I think a lot of Detroiters feel,” Bitely said. “And Duggan has come right and said, ‘I’m not a Democrat anymore. Those values don’t match my values, but I’m also not a Republican, because those values don’t match my values.”
That leads Bitely to believe that people in the city of Detroit would see Duggan as a more viable option.
“Detroit has seen such a resurgence under Duggan that there’s almost no way a Democrat is going to win the city with Duggan on the ballot,” she said. “I think that happens when you have somebody good in charge for so long.”
But, on the subject of Benson and her chances in the city, Bitely said Benson was polling significantly down against Duggan. And, as voters saw in November with Vice President Kamala Harris, some voters still have a strong aversion to casting a ballot for women candidates. 
“In the most recent election, we saw a bump toward [President Donald Trump] with male voters in the city of Detroit, at a significantly larger number than I think a lot of people expected,” Bitely said. “The Worthy endorsement of Benson may help her some in the primary, but overall, Mike Duggan has the city of Detroit locked up. There is zero chance that Jocelyn Benson can beat Mike Duggan in the city of Detroit.”
That speaks volumes of Duggan and where Benson stands, but it also doesn’t bode well for Gilchrist, either. Bitely noted that Gilchrist is the second-in-command of the state next to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and has shown himself to be a caring leader, but he also didn’t win in the city when he ran for clerk prior to becoming Whitmer’s running mate in 2018.
The pair beat out the Republicans in the 2018 general election – former Attorney General Bill Schuette and current Kent County Clerk Lisa Lyons – and Gilchrist ascended to the history books as the first Black lieutenant governor in state history.
Bitely said it was generally difficult to win an election in Detroit on a candidate’s first go, but it was also telling that Gilchrist’s own running mate in Whitmer has yet to extend her endorsement.
“That’s not necessarily a kiss of death, but it makes his journey to being governor a lot more challenging,” Bitely said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Facetune_02-11-2024-08-41-47-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 08:08:29.684277

Photo by Senate Media Services.The long-awaited felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, begins Monday after multiple delays and the conclusion of two legislative sessions since her arrest.
Seventh Judicial District Chief Judge Michael Fritz last month delayed Mitchell’s trial, scheduled to begin on June 16, because of the assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and the attempted assassination of Mitchell’s colleague, Sen. John Hoffman.
The trial, which is expected to play out like a messy family drama, will begin Monday in Detroit Lakes with jury selection; opening statements from the prosecution and defense are expected Monday afternoon or Tuesday.
Mitchell was arrested on April 22, 2024, in Detroit Lakes after police allege they found her in her stepmother’s basement around 4:45 a.m. She told police that she was attempting to retrieve some of her late father’s possessions, including his ashes, according to the amended criminal complaint.
In a Facebook statement shortly after her arrest, Mitchell denied stealing anything and said she drove to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home because she was concerned about the cognitive state of her stepmother, who she says suffers from Alzheimer’s.
“Unfortunately, I startled this close relative, exacerbating paranoia, and I was accused of stealing, which I absolutely deny,” Mitchell said in a Facebook statement.
Mitchell’s voluminous public statements and her interviews with police after the incident — without an attorney present, even though she herself is an attorney — have created a challenge for her at trial. In those comments, she admitted to being in a home that isn’t hers. Charging papers allege she said she was there to obtain disputed property. She will need to persuade the jury that the actions were justified.
This might be a tall feat in conservative Becker County, where the trial will be held. In 2024, Becker County voted for President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris by 33 percentage points, and jurors may not have a favorable opinion of a metro Democrat.
Mitchell has been charged with first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools — police found a blue crowbar near an egress window where they say Mitchell broke into her stepmother’s home. If found guilty of first-degree burglary, Mitchell faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and if found guilty of possession of burglary tools she faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison.
Mitchell’s arrest set off a firestorm in the Minnesota Capitol, particularly in the Senate where Democrats hold a one-seat, 34-33 majority. Mitchell’s own vote has been the tie-breaker for multiple Democratic-Farmer-Labor-backed bills, especially last year. Senate Republicans have tried to oust her and prevent her from casting her crucial vote multiple times since her arrest.
The first-term senator has resisted calls to resign from her own party, including then Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chair Ken Martin and Gov. Tim Walz. Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy expelled Mitchell from caucus meetings and stripped her of her committee assignments.
Last year, Mitchell didn’t speak on the Senate floor after her arrest and kept a low profile. The Woodbury senator has been speaking up on the floor about various bills this year, however, and lately she’s been posting her way through the charges, sharing photos of herself with constituents and students on her government social media accounts.
Bruce Ringstrom Jr., Mitchell’s defense attorney, in a statement to the Reformer last month said the senator is confident that jurors will find reasonable doubt in the case against Mitchell and ultimately find her not guilty.
“Sen. Mitchell is confident that taking this case to trial is the correct decision. She understands that juries sometimes make decisions inconsistent with the evidence but is prepared to take that risk. Sen. Mitchell believes that if the jury holds the state to its burden of proof that she will be found not guilty,” Ringstrom said.
Here’s a breakdown of what’s happened in the case against Mitchell since her arrest.
What happened on the day of the arrest, according to police
Mitchell told police she left her Woodbury home around 1 a.m. on April 22 — a Monday when the Legislature was still in session — and drove to her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home, according to the amended criminal complaint.
The stepmother, Carol Mitchell, said she called 911 after finding a person on the floor next to her bed. Carol Mitchell later told the police she had stepped on the person, later identified as Nicole Mitchell, who then ran into the basement.
Officers found Mitchell in the basement dressed in black clothing and a black hat. During the arrest, Nicole Mitchell addressed her stepmother: “Carol, it’s Nicole. I was just trying to get a couple of my dad’s things because you wouldn’t talk to me anymore,” the complaint states.
Roderick Mitchell, Nicole Mitchell’s father, died without a will in 2023, according to the complaint. A probate court awarded Carol Mitchell 100% of Roderick Mitchell’s estate.
Nicole Mitchell later told police that she hadn’t talked to Carol Mitchell in about a month.
“I have never done anything like this,” Mitchell told the officers. “You are going to find out I am a military commander for God’s sake.” Mitchell reiterated that “there were just a couple things of my dad’s I wanted to come get,” according to the complaint.
As an officer was reading Nicole Mitchell her Miranda rights, she said, “I’m just hoping, um, this mistake won’t completely f*ck up my life.” An officer told Mitchell she was being placed under arrest. Mitchell, according to the complaint, sat silently and became emotional. “My God, my military retirement. Shoot.”
Officers later found a backpack wedged into a sliding glass window in the basement. They found Mitchell’s driver’s license, Senate ID and a laptop inside the backpack, according to the complaint. Carol Mitchell later called law enforcement and said she found a blue crowbar next to an egress window that wasn’t hers. Police determined that the basement sliding glass window was too small for a person to fit into, so Mitchell likely entered the house through the egress window, according to the complaint.
What’s happened in the case since Mitchell’s arrest
Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to both felony charges.
Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald and Ringstrom, Mitchell’s attorney, last year agreed to a stipulation that the laptop found in Mitchell’s backpack was not stolen and the prosecution cannot argue that she tried to steal it.
The prosecution also asked Fritz, the judge, to order defense counsel to refrain from referring to Mitchell as “senator” in front of the jury, which Fritz denied.
The trial was initially scheduled to begin in January of this year, but the judge granted the defense’s motion to delay it until after the 2025 session finished, following a 2007 appellate ruling stating that legal proceedings involving legislators should be delayed until after the legislative session.
Last month, Fritz denied all pretrial motions from Mitchell’s defense. Mitchell’s attorneys asked Fritz to dismiss the possession of felony burglary tools charge, which was added 10 months after her arrest. The defense alleged this was “prosecutorial vindictiveness,” but the judge disagreed.
Fritz also denied the defense’s motion to access Carol Mitchell’s medical records related to an April 2024 doctor’s appointment at Sanford Medical Clinic in Fargo, which Mitchell’s attorneys say would reveal the extent of her stepmother’s decline.
Late last month, the prosecution asked the judge to preclude the defense from calling Mitchell’s stepfather and a man with whom Mitchell served in the military as witnesses. The judge has yet to rule on the prosecution’s motions.
The trial is expected to last five days.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GLed_u6XgAAaBui-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 08:08:29.684277

(Photo: Ioneer)A proposed lithium-boron mine in Nevada has been delayed for a second time amid a lithium price crash caused by softer electric vehicle demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally.
Earlier this month, Australian-based mining developer Ioneer Corp. agreed to delay initial construction on their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County until at least March 2026, according to a stipulated agreement.
The updated timeline comes after Ioneer lost its biggest investor in February when South Africa-based Sibanye-Stillwater scrapped its planned $490 million investment in the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.
Low lithium prices have forced a raft of companies to pause or delay spending on projects from Quebec to South Carolina and Argentina to Australia.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium prices soared to nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022, before hitting around $9,000 per tonne this July. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile in 2025.
Despite the construction delay, Ioneer said the company is still expecting production to start in 2028, following a three-year construction period once the company makes a final investment decision to green light the project.
That final decision will also depend on Ioneer finding an equity partner to replace the capital lost when Sibanye-Stillwater pulled out of the mine’s development. 
Last month, Ioneer formally began the search for an equity partner capable of supporting an accelerated development timeline and advancing lithium-boron production at the mine. The search is expected to take four to five months, according to Ioneer. 
“We’re talking to many, many different companies who have an interest in this project because of its lithium, because of its boron, and because it’s in the United States,” said Ioneer Managing Director Bernard Rowe. 
Volatility in the lithium market will not deter investment or the eventual construction of the Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project, said Rowe, adding that the project’s unique attributes and low-cost structure make it an attractive project.
  Ioneer’s Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine is in the Silver Peak Range in Esmeralda County near the state line with California. (BLM map)
Rhyolite Ridge in Nevada is one of the only two major known global deposits of lithium-boron. Boron is a mineral used in everything from glass to medicine to cleaning products. If constructed, it would be the first new boron mine in the U.S. in nearly a century. The revenue split between the two commodities is roughly 70% lithium and 30% boron, providing a potential hedge when lithium prices drop.
Ioneer estimates the cost of production at the mine will pencil out to about $5,745 per ton of lithium after factoring in revenue from the boron produced at the mine, placing production costs in the lowest quartile of the global lithium cost curve. 
Ioneer has experience with lithium volatility, having built similar projects during periods of lower lithium prices, Rowe said. Specific project economics rather than industry-wide conditions determine viability, he added.
“There’s very logical reasons why there is volatility. It’s because it’s a small market that’s growing rapidly, and it’s easy to get a mismatch, to either have too much supply or not enough. It’s very easy for that to happen when you’re dealing with a very small, but rapidly growing market like lithium,” Rowe said. 
Simon Jowitt, the state geologist for the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology at UNR, said lithium mines that sustain low production costs can cope with lower prices. He pointed to Albemarle Corp.’s Silver Peak Mine in Clayton Valley, which has remained active since the 1950s due to its ability to sustain low production costs. 
Getting to that point will be more difficult for mines that haven’t broken ground yet, said Jowitt. Construction is the most expensive period for a mining operation and requires significant capital expenditure without immediate returns. That can lead to companies pulling out of projects during drops in lithium price while investors look at more price-stable metals like gold, silver, and copper.
“We’ve seen this low lithium price impact development and slow development of lithium operations, and actually seeing some mines shutting down in Australia and other countries,” said Jowitt. 
“The mines that are under construction are likely to wait until they see a rebound in the lithium price,” he added.
An Ioneer study released in June also quadrupled Rhyolite Ridge’s potential lithium-boron reserves from 60 million tonnes in 2020 to 247 million tonnes, sharply increasing both the project’s mine life and its development cost.
The reserve boost extends the expected mine life to 95 years, up from 26 years outlined in the company’s 2020 feasibility study and increases capital expenditure by more than doubled to $1.67 billion, up from around $800 million.
A longer life span could also prove vital. Despite current volatility, mining companies and analysts anticipate that demand for lithium will rise over the next decade due to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage technologies. 
While it’s difficult to predict future lithium prices, Jowitt said analysts expect lithium prices to become less volatile as the market matures, but that will take time and depends on demand for lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles.
A recent U.S. Geological Survey analysis found that about 87% of global lithium production goes into batteries, and the vast majority of those batteries are for electric vehicles. 
However, in the near-to-medium term, production cuts may be necessary to stabilize prices and rebalance the market.
“Over the next 30 years, we are going to see a significant increase in demand for lithium, and you can say that for a wide variety of different commodities due to increasing electrification and so on. But 30 years is too long a period to actually base any development decisions on,” Jowitt said. 
The mine has also faced other troubles. The project has attracted fierce opposition from conservation groups which oppose the mine’s encroachment on critical habitat reserved for the endangered wildflower Tiehm’s buckwheat. The delay was a result of a stipulated agreement between Ioneer and the Center for Biological Diversity in order to avoid a preliminary injunction for an ongoing lawsuit against the mine.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2-walking-across-rhyolite-ridge-south-basin.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 08:08:29.684277

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump Administration’s Health and Human Services Administration under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
‘I question it myself’: South Dakota vaccination rates fall amid mistrust and misinformation

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
South Dakota has reported four cases since June 2.

,California,2025-07-11 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Charter schools need reform. This proposal could kneecap them,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/charter-schools-california-reforms/,Lawmakers are considering creating an inspector general role just to oversee charter schools. It might slow the charter school movement.,"The California Legislature deals with thousands of bills every year, and many are perennials that reflect long-running economic, ethnic and cultural conflicts.
Warring interests try to gain the upper hand vis-à-vis their rivals. Regardless of the outcomes in any one legislative session, inevitably they clash again while augmenting their lobbying with efforts to bend public opinion and influence legislative elections.
Examples of the syndrome abound. There’s the perpetual jousting between personal injury attorneys and insurers over rules governing lawsuits, efforts by medical care providers to expand the scope of their practices while invading the turf of other practitioners, and the running battle between tribal casinos and cardrooms over gambling games.
For the last three decades, California’s public education establishment — school boards and school unions, primarily — has waged political war against charter schools.
Charters are public schools but are exempt from many of the rules governing conventional schools. They enroll about 11% of California’s nearly 6 million public school kids, ranging from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade, and receive shares of the more than $100 billion that the state spends on public education each year.
Charter advocates say they respond to parents dissatisfied with the educations their children receive in traditional schools. Their critics say they enroll a narrow slice of the student pool and divert money better spent on improving traditional education.
The battles over charter schools are often waged at the local level, because charters must be sanctioned by local school boards. An epic war has been underway for years in Los Angeles Unified, the nation’s second largest school system. It ebbs and flows, depending on whether unions or charter advocates control the school board after each election cycle.
The public education establishment, particularly its unions, is very influential in the Capitol and has pursued a steady stream of bills that make forming charters more difficult or attempt to impose restrictions on those already operating.
This year’s version is Assembly Bill 84, which has cleared the Assembly and is now pending in the Senate.
Backed by school boards and school unions, the measure purports to deal with scandals in charters that don’t offer classroom instruction but rather operate via the internet or other means.
Those scandals are real. The most notorious involved A3 Education, which had a network of 19 online charter schools. An investigation by the San Diego County district attorney’s office revealed that the system’s founders fraudulently obtained hundreds of millions of dollars. They were prosecuted and more than $200 million in purloined funds was recovered.
In response to A3 Education and other scandals, the state declared a moratorium on new non-classroom charters and commissioned a study to determine which reforms are needed to guard against fraud.
AB 84 embraces many of the recommendations emerging from the study by the Legislative Analyst’s Office and the state’s Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team. But the bill goes further, with new accounting and operational processes that could make it more difficult for all kinds of charters to be formed or to function.
One provision — ignored in the analyses of the bill presented to legislators — would create an entirely new position of inspector general with very broad powers, housed in the state Department of Education, but appointed by the governor.
The co-authors of SB 84, Democratic Assemblymen Al Muratsuchi and Robert Garcia, contend that it’s needed to prevent future scandals such as A3 and allow the moratorium on non-classroom charters to be lifted.
That’s valid as far as it goes. But it also would provide new tools that the education establishment could use to thwart new charters and make life more difficult for existing charters by imposing rules that mirror those for traditional schools.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051122_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-11 08:08:29.684277

Lt. Col. Lemuel Penn, an assistant superintendent for Washington, D.C., public schools, was driving home with two fellow officers from the U.S. Army Reserves training when he was shot and killed by three Klansmen in a passing car in Colbert, Georgia. Penn had survived World War II, fighting in New Guinea and the Philippines, earning a Bronze Star. But he died in the attack by Klansmen, just nine days after the Civil Rights Act became law. 
Spotting the Washington, D.C., license plates, Klansman Howard Sims remarked, “That must be one of President Johnson’s boys.” He then said, “I’m going to kill me a n—–,” before he and Klansman Cecil Myers opened fire with their double-barreled shotguns on the car Penn was driving. 
The blast from the shotgun killed Penn, and the car slammed into the side of the Broad River Bridge. 
Incredibly, the judge in the case allowed Sims and Myers to take the witness stand without being cross-examined. An all-white Georgia jury found the two Klansmen not guilty, but a federal court jury convicted them. Each served about six years in federal prison. The jury, however, acquitted the other Klansman in the car as well as three other Klansmen identified as taking part in the planning. 
Years after his release from prison, Sims was killed by a friend with a 12-gauge shotgun — the same kind of gun Sims had used to shoot Penn. 
The Penn case was instrumental in the creation of a Justice Department task force, which eventually led to the Civil Rights Act of 1968. When Penn’s body arrived at Arlington National Cemetery, his casket was transferred to the same caisson used for President Kennedy with the same white horses. He received full military honors.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06102310/July11-FeatImage-Lemuel-Penn-SPLC.jpg,,,2025-07-11 09:07:59.748350

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey said Thursday that changes to the State Board of Veterans Affairs would allow the state to better serve roughly 400,000 veterans in Alabama.
The remarks at the board’s meeting came months after the Legislature approved a bill removing the board’s policy-making ability and turning it into an advisory body, and amid a lawsuit from former Alabama Veterans Affairs Commissioner Kent Davis, who claims Ivey wrongfully terminated him last year.
“Alabama’s veterans deserve our very best,” Ivey said in her speech that opened the meeting. “We will use this new structure to better focus on what matters most; serving those who sacrificed for our freedoms — our veterans.”

Ivey did not offer any specifics regarding the impact the new structure will have on the veterans board or the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs.
The changes to the board came after a battle between Ivey and Davis last fall. Ivey accused Davis of not spending federal money allocated to the state in a timely manner and of filing a frivolous ethics complaint against Alabama Department of Mental Health Commissioner Kim Boswell, which was later dismissed.
In a news conference last month, Davis disavowed the allegation that he mishandled ARPA funds and said that he was required by state law to file the ethics complaint after members of the State Board of Veterans Affairs said they had concerns with Boswell.
Initially, Davis agreed to leave at the end of the year. But the board, saying it found no evidence of wrongdoing, later asked him to rescind his resignation. Ivey later called a meeting and terminated Davis. Davis filed suit last month, alleging Ivey violated his free speech and due process rights.
“It is pretty clear that she got it restructured because she did not have the authority to fire Admiral Davis, although she did,” said Kenneth Mendelsohn on Thursday, the attorney representing Davis in the lawsuit he filed against Ivey. “This gives her control over the Board, whereas in the past she had one vote on it.”
SB 67, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Jones, R-Centre, transferred the authority for appointing the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs from the board to the governor’s office, which selects a nominee based on a list of names provided by veterans organizations
The law also stripped the board’s power to set rules and policies for the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs, essentially relegating the veterans board to an advisory role.
“My commitment to all the veterans’ coalitions throughout the state, to veterans throughout the state, is anything that comes forward to me, like before, is going to be a directive,” said Jeffrey L. Newton, the commissioner tapped to succeed Davis. “It is really no change as far as taking the Board’s recommendations, and anything they need, any advice they give, we are going to go forward with it.”
Davis attended Thursday’s meeting.
“I thought it was a pleasant meeting today,” Davis said in an interview Thursday. “It was short. That was the shortest SBVA meeting I have ever seen.”
He added that, “I wish them luck. I wish them nothing but the best. I told a lot of the new members, ‘Just make sure you are serving veterans.’”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7319-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-11 08:08:29.684277

EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.

The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)County boards of elections can double the distance where electioneering is prohibited outside of polling booths and ballot boxes under a bill signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy this week. 
The new law, approved by lawmakers in the final weeks before the Legislature’s summer recess, allows election officials to bar electioneering within 200 feet of the outside entrance of any polling place or ballot drop box while voters are casting ballots. Current law bars electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place.
Party officials said they don’t think an expanded ban is necessary.
“These days, in the days of social media, people can reach you inside the polling place on your phone. Unless they were being obtrusive, I don’t see any reason why it has to be even banned in the 100-feet area,” said Peg Schaffer, chair of the Somerset County Democratic Party and vice chair of the statewide party. “I think it’s potentially an invasion of free speech, and I’m hoping my county board doesn’t do it.”
Sean Earlen, the GOP chair in Burlington County, said he doesn’t know that expanding the no-electioneering zone changes anything in his county.
“I’m not aware or accustomed to significant issues with electioneering in Burlington County,” Earlen said.
The bill advanced largely along party lines. It passed the Assembly 54-22 and the Senate 30-8.

Please keep faith in the truth. It, and each other, are all we’ve got. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter Macia: The federal government has abdicated its role as our Vermont’s partner.","This commentary is by Peter Macia of Charlotte.


If you spent the week of July 4 wondering why the sunsets were orange and the smell of cow manure seemed particularly strong, don’t blame our local hard-working farmers or the Canadian forests. The soon-to-be decimated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had observed a powerful jet stream flowing north up the eastern seaboard, carrying with it a thick, toxic cloud of BS particulate from Washington, D.C., all the way up to Vermont. 
The passing wind of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” act stunk so heavily of this BS that it still feels like it may never go away, but as many Vermonters know, the stench is actually a reminder that we must again plant our seeds and tend to our fields.
With this bill and various actions since Jan. 20, Donald Trump, the Republican-controlled Congress, and the deeply conservative Supreme Court have exposed the lies they told to gain power and left Vermont (and most other states) alone to fend for itself. The federal government has abdicated its role as our state’s partner. 
It is estimated that 45,000 of us will lose health care due to cuts in Medicaid. A full quarter of Vermonters rely on Medicaid. Of those, three-in-10 are children, three-in-five live in rural areas. How many thousands more will be impacted by the $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, in addition to restrictions on Medicare and Obamacare, that are in this bill? Trump and the GOP promised not to touch these programs, and now they have gutted them because they do not care about us. We are now left alone to care for ourselves.

More than 65,000 Vermonters, most whom are children or people with disabilities, receive SNAP food assistance. 13,000 could lose those benefits from this bill. Their parents and caretakers will have to stretch every penny just to put food on the table and in lunch boxes. We have been left alone to feed our most needy.
Vermonters have enthusiastically embraced solar power and electric vehicles. It has made our state more energy independent, our air cleaner, and allowed us to spend less of our paychecks to keep our lights on and our vehicles running. It has provided jobs to hundreds of Vermonters as they build, install and support this move toward more sustainable and cleaner energy. Trump and the GOP have eliminated all meaningful incentives and tax credits that made solar and EVs affordable for most Vermonters. We are alone to figure out how to keep going.
Vermont’s schools have long been the envy of the rest of the country. Trump and the GOP have taken back $26 million in appropriated funds for Vermont’s schools, eliminated food assistance for Vermont’s children, and made it harder for Vermont’s trans kids to be free. All this while attempting to silence our teachers when they talk about civil rights and factual American history. We are alone to protect our children’s future.

Vermont has welcomed thousands of recent immigrants, both as refugees and agricultural workers. They have kept Vermont working and vibrant. Trump and the GOP promised they would only deport criminals, but only a rare few of these targeted Vermonters have committed any crime at all (being undocumented is a civil not criminal offense).
Trump and the GOP have also stripped the protective status of many Vermonters who came here seeking asylum. They have prosecuted immigrants from other states in Vermont’s courts and detained them in our state.
This bill will divert hundreds of billions of dollars from programs that help people to fund ICE and Homeland Security. They are leaving Vermont alone to support our immigrant neighbors, but they are also leaving American-born Vermonters alone by stripping critical federal funds from programs and organizations that make our state stronger, safer, and more solvent, all to pay for aggression and militarization, both here and abroad.
Trump and the GOP claimed that making the 2017 tax cuts permanent would magically make everyone wealthier, in the same breath saying that everyone has felt poorer since 2020. By changing nothing they claim something will change. Vermont will be left alone to shoulder its share of the $5 trillion that this bill will add to the deficit.
Meanwhile, Trump and the GOP have set a ticking time bomb with blanket, economically onerous tariffs that will be passed on to us, the consumers. Building supplies, food, solar panels, toys for children and adults, skis and snowboards, our beloved Volvos and Toyotas and Subarus, all of it will become more expensive. Not if, but when. We are left alone to watch the clock as pre-tariff inventories run low.
So, we Vermonters are alone because Trump and the GOP chose to lie to gain power and use that power to try and take everything we care about away from us. But the good news is that finally it should be clear that all of us — Democrats, Republicans, independents, socialists, capitalists, progressives and conservatives — are in this mess together and only together will we get out.

Stock.adobe.com photo by by Tada Images.It won’t happen immediately, but advocates and state officials are predicting that changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the budget reconciliation bill signed last week will deliver “a devastating blow” to many of the 680,000 Marylanders who get SNAP benefits.
The biggest change that recipients will see are new work requirements for some able-bodied recipients that analysts say many Marylanders simply will not be able to meet, for a number of reasons.
The bill also includes a massive shift in costs from the federal to the state governments. Currently, the split administrative costs for the program 50/50 and the federal government pays for all the costs of the actual benefit.
Beginning next year, states will pay 75% of administration, at a cost of $172.5 million, according to estimates from the Maryland Department of Human Services. A year later, they will pay for up to 15% of the actual benefits, according to a formula based on current performance. Maryland will pay the most, 15%, at a cost in current dollars of $240 million.
The bill also caps future benefit increases at the rate of inflation and limits eligibility to citizens and lawful permanent residents; refugees and asylum-seekers would be kicked off the program.
The Urban Institute estimated this month that about 369,000 Maryland families would lose some or all SNAP benefits. Of those, 81,000 would lose an average of $150 a month — the current average monthly benefit in Maryland is $180 — and 51,000 families with children would lose and average of $81 a month.

“We are really trying to get our head around these impacts,” Maryland Human Services Secretary Rafael López said in an interview last week. “They are massive. They will be felt across the state.”
While some of the cuts will take some time to be felt, López said that “at the end of the day, they are still cuts to benefits for Marylanders.”
The cuts were included in H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump to great ceremony on the Fourth of July. The bill also makes deep cuts to Medicaid and cuts taxes, with a bottom line that it could add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.
For SNAP nationwide, the Urban Institute report estimates that some 22.3 million families will lose “some or all of their SNAP benefits,” and 5.3 million of those families will lose an average of $146 per month.
Ayesha Holmes, Maryland Director of No Kid Hungry, said these changes are “a devastating blow” to working families.
“These extra burdens that are being added to families are difficult. They’re going to be hard to overcome,” she said.
Of the more than 680,000 Maryland residents that rely on SNAP currently to feed themselves and their families, more than 270,000 are children, according to DHS.
Holmes said that while Maryland’s legislators and other state officials understand the impact of these cuts, the amount of funding needed to support SNAP can really only come from the federal government.
“Unfortunately, what’s happened in Washington is really going to put not just Maryland, but all states at a disadvantage by hurting our most vulnerable,” she said. “It’s going to hurt us all.”
She added that the full impact of the SNAP changes will also depend on how many people will be able to find work that satisfies the program’s new eligibility requirements, which requires most able-bodied recipients to work at least 80 hours a month, or 20 hours a week.
“If folks are able to get the job that meets this work requirement standard, they’ll stay on the rolls,” Holmes said. “If, for some reason they’re not, then they won’t. And people, I imagine, will do their best. But even with everything going right, people lose their jobs. People get sick and their kids get sick.”
“Families are going to have to make some tough choices, and it’s at the point where the people do that is when we will really see the impact,” she said.

SNAP cuts could also affect some businesses in the state: For groceries that get a significant amount of their business from SNAP recipients, the reductions could pose a threat.
Maryland Retailers Alliance President Cailey Locklair said there’s no indication yet whether that will happen. But any reduction in consumer spending could have a serious impact on grocers, she said, given the industry’s low average profit margins of 3% or less.
“I have some retailers where the majority of the revenue that’s coming in is from individuals who are receiving benefits,” Locklair said. “So the sheer viability of some of those brick-and-mortar retailers in communities that are underserved is going to be contingent on the same level of spending going on.”
Leah Aiello Paley, CEO of the Anne Arundel County Food Bank, said she expects there will be a greater reliance on charitable and nonprofit organizations, including food banks and pantries, as a result of these benefit reductions. But there’s only so much they can do.
“We’re in a position to try to rise to the occasion and meet the need as best we can, but there’s no way with dramatic cuts to the program that food banks and pantries are able to do so,” Paley said.
She said the food bank hasn’t seen any significant increases in demand yet, and currently provides service to an average of almost 50,000 a month across its 110 distribution locations in the county.
Paley noted that changes to SNAP benefits could alter eligibility to other assistance programs, such as free or reduced-price meals in schools. That could lead to kids going to school hungry, she said, because their family is food insecure and they can no longer get fed at school.
“​​That’s just screaming behavioral and emotional health issues in the classroom,” Paley said.
“You think about this cycle of if you have a student who cannot learn because they are hungry, and over time what that impact is to them in terms of achieving economic and educational outcomes, we are in for a very rude awakening,” she said. “And it certainly is very scary to think about the short term and the long term impact on families.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AdobeStock_389122280_Editorial_Use_Only-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 07:06:53.732535

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Governor's Office)A bitter legal fight in Hunterdon County that’s now before a federal appeals court in Philadelphia could impact how schools handle transgender and gender-questioning students across New Jersey and the nation.
Christin Heaps sued his daughter’s Hunterdon County high school last year after she told her school counselor she wanted to use a male name and pronouns. School administrators did not tell him of this change, which Heaps said he learned about by chance when another parent mentioned the child by a male name.
In the federal lawsuit Heaps filed in January 2024, he accused staff at Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown of deliberately interfering with his constitutional right as a parent to determine how best to raise his child.
Now, Heaps’ daughter is home-schooled (both he and attorneys for the school say his daughter no longer wishes to use male pronouns). But Heaps hopes to persuade judges to strike down Policy 5756. That’s the statewide guidance — already challenged in court by several school districts — that state education officials issued in 2018 advising districts they can accept a student’s change in gender identity without notifying parents.
Heaps has a powerful ally on his side. Alliance Defending Freedom, a well-funded conservative Christian legal advocacy group, has joined his legal team and asked the 3d Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia to hear oral arguments in the case.
While the Southern Poverty Law Center has declared the alliance a hate group, it has had an outsized influence on the Trump administration in its advocacy against LGBTQ protections and reproductive rights, among other issues. The alliance’s attorneys have racked up more than a dozen U.S. Supreme Court wins and have successfully pushed conservative legislation in statehouses around the country. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) was an alliance attorney and spokesman before joining Congress.
In the Heaps case, the alliance has lined up 22 states and a bevy of right-wing groups to back its cause.
Aaron Potenza, a policy consultant for LGBTQ rights group Garden State Equality, called the case and its possible repercussions “deeply troubling.”
“You’re talking about kids who are vulnerable, coming out to a trusted adult about something very personal, telling that trusted adult, ‘I don’t feel safe around this issue with my family. I’m not ready to come out to my family,’” Potenza said. “The negative outcomes of being ‘forcibly outed’ range from something as serious as physical and emotional abuse to being kicked out of the home, which we know does happen all the time to LGBTQ, and in particular trans, youth.”










We are in a climate right now — nationally, at least — where, if something like this goes to the Supreme Court, we can imagine what the outcome is going to be.


– Aaron Potenza, policy consultant for Garden State Equality


The legal fight comes amid a federal landscape that has become more hostile to transgender youth since Heaps first filed his lawsuit. Donald Trump has been reelected president, the White House has targeted trans protections, and the U.S. Supreme Court has issued two key rulings on LGBTQ matters, one allowing states to ban gender-affirming care for transgender minors and another letting parents opt their child out of instruction involving LGBTQ-themed books.
“New Jersey students are fortunate in that, for decades, this state has been comparatively progressive in its protection of students,” said Robert Kim, executive director of the Education Law Center. “But the broader legal developments in other states and federally right now are troubling as related to LGBT-plus students. We’ve seen extremely hostile executive orders and policies coming out of the Trump administration and we do need to keep track of developments in the U.S. Supreme Court as related to the student population as well.”
State protections also could be threatened, with New Jersey voters poised to pick a new governor in November, advocates added. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, and U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are running to replace Gov. Phil Murphy, who’s term-limited.
When Ciattarelli ran for governor in 2021, he said he would “roll back” curriculum that has required LGBTQ lessons in the classroom. Asked at a debate in February about Murphy executive orders protecting transgender residents, Ciattarelli said he’s would “protect any and all groups, particularly marginalized groups.”
Whoever wins is expected to install their own attorney general — who might have different policy priorities — in place of Attorney General Matt Platkin, who has fought to preserve Policy 5756.
“The next governor, and their appointed attorney general, hold a lot of influence over whether all New Jerseyans will continue to be protected by long-established civil rights laws and can reject federal overreach in extremist Supreme Court decisions,” said Barbara Simon, GLAAD’s senior director of news.
 The fight in Frenchtown

Heaps, a plumber by trade who lives in Pittstown, did not respond to the New Jersey Monitor’s request for comment, and his attorneys declined to make him available for an interview.
But in court filings, he blasted school officials for secretly proceeding with his daughter’s social transitioning without knowing that she had been in therapy since middle school for depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, and the trauma of her mother’s death when she was 4.
His daughter was a freshman and member of an extracurricular club, Students Advocating for Equality, in the fall of 2023, when she told Ashley Miranda, a school counselor and the club’s adviser, that she wanted to use a male name and pronouns, according to court briefs. Attorneys for the school say the girl told Miranda she did not want her father informed.
Heaps learned about it in December 2023 and told school officials to stop, because such social transitioning interfered with her therapy. But school officials, citing Policy 5756, said they would continue using the name and pronouns his daughter requested until she indicated otherwise, according to court briefs. Heaps removed the child from school, and administrators threatened the family with truancy proceedings, his attorneys charged.
“Defendants seek to honor major life choices of minor children related to their education, mental, and physical health without the parents’ fully informed consent, while also attempting to keep such choices secret from parents, as in this case, which violates the long-recognized constitutional principle that custodial parents ‘possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life’s difficult decisions,’” Heaps’ attorneys wrote.
In his lawsuit, Heaps named as defendants the school, its board of education, Miranda, Superintendent of Schools Scott McKinney, Platkin, and Kevin Dehmer, the state education commissioner. Court filings name his daughter as “Jane Doe” to protect her privacy.
Heaps wants judges to declare Policy 5756 unconstitutional and bar Platkin from using the state Law Against Discrimination to justify allowing districts to accommodate students’ social transitioning without parental notification. He also wants his daughter back in school, accompanied by an independent monitor to “protect (his) parental rights” at the school board’s expense.
U.S. District Judge Georgette Castner has twice rejected Heaps’ arguments and requests for injunctions, most recently in November, when she found no “proactive intrusion into private family matters.”
“The record indicates that Jane initiated the request to socially transition, and that the Board Defendants did not coerce Jane into making the request or prevent or discourage Jane from discussing her request with Plaintiff,” Castner wrote. “The record demonstrates that the Board Defendants acted only at Jane’s affirmative request.”
He appealed the case to the 3rd Circuit in December, and Alliance Defending Freedom joined the case. In a brief filed late last month, alliance attorneys argued that “deeply rooted history and tradition protect parents’ rights, including when their children attend school.”
“The government must not second-guess a parental decision simply because adolescent dislikes it,” alliance attorneys wrote.
A Platkin spokesman declined to comment.
State attorneys have tried to get the case dismissed.
“If it is in fact true that the child no longer desires to be addressed with a male name and pronouns at school, then there is no need for litigation at all — under the District’s own policy, there would be no basis to continue addressing the child in such a manner,” Deputy Attorney General Matthew Lynch wrote in an August brief. “Rather than a basis for emergency practice, it would be a basis to find the case moot, as no court order would be needed.”
Castner, though, denied that request too, writing in November that the case is not moot because Heaps wants his daughter to return to the 700-student school, where the policy remains in place and would be enforced.
 A balancing act

Kim, the Education Law Center director, finds the legal fight to be “a complex balance of interests and rights” between transgender students who face harm at home from unsupportive families, and parents who have the right to direct the upbringing of their children.
“Schools are in a really tough spot here. They do have this in loco parentis responsibility to protect children in the school environment and prevent harm or hostility to the student, and they also have a duty legally to protect the privacy of students in their transgender or transitioning status,” Kim said. “At the same time, schools have a duty to keep parents informed about what’s going on with their children, absolutely, and they also have the duty to provide access to student records.”
He applauded Platkin for pushing back on school districts for “not getting this balance correct,” referring to Platkin suing four districts — Manalapan, Marlboro, Middletown, and Hanover — that had passed policies requiring parental notification when students change their gender expression.
Platkin has defended Policy 5756 as a “student-centered” approach, and its supporters say it’s backed by pediatric psychology and development experts.
But Potenza predicted that Platkin and state education officials will be driven to issue further guidance to schools in coming months, with lawsuits like Heaps’ and ongoing federal attacks on pro-LGBTQ policies leaving schools leery of making missteps.
“We are in a climate right now — nationally, at least — where, if something like this goes to the Supreme Court, we can imagine what the outcome is going to be,” Potenza said. “They have shown that they’re not very open to these claims that trans kids have rights under the Constitution.”

We are making progress here in Burlington, which will culminate in our opening an overdose prevention center.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ed Baker: When things are at their worst, we are at our best.","This commentary is by Ed Baker of Burlington. He has lived experience as a person with drug addiction. He is a member of the Academy of Certified Social Workers, retired from a career in the substance use field. He is currently an activist for public health in Vermont.


The number one leading cause of death for Vermonters aged 50 and below is accidental drug overdose, according to the Department of Health. We are in the very midst of an undeclared public health emergency that deeply affects every county, town, neighborhood and family in Vermont. Downtown Burlington is the epicenter of this tragedy. We experience common suffering daily.   
For calendar year 2023 there were 211 accidental deaths in Vermont, with 176 of these being due to accidental or unknown intent drug overdose, according to the Department of Health. According to State’s Attorney Sarah George, Chittenden County had the highest number of deaths (50) in 2023, with approximately half these deaths concentrated within the downtown Burlington area. 
We Vermonters were alerted to this evolving crisis in 2014 by then Gov. Peter Shumlin in his State of the State address, where he warned that “In every corner of our state, heroin and opiate drug addiction threatens us.”

In 2016 the crisis began to morph into the beast we see today. Fentanyl, the most powerful opioid available, became the leading contributor to opioid overdose death in Vermont.
This continues to be the case today, with well over 90% of opioid-related fatalities involving fentanyl. Today this is complicated by the addition of xylazine to the unregulated drug supply, an animal tranquilizer causing severe infections of soft tissue. 
We collectively face an ever-worsening and increasingly lethal perfect storm. Vermonters often most vulnerable to this near-indescribable travesty are Vermonters with chronically unmet needs, often unhoused, with mental health challenges complicating their addiction. They are very often alienated from the mainstream, outside traditional treatment techniques’ ability to engage them. They are dying. 
It is our responsibility, and this is not debatable in my opinion, to protect them, to see to it that they have the very best and most effective means available to them to keep them alive and support their gradual movement toward health. 
The quote “when things are at their worst we are at our best” comes to mind.
Available research data at this point unequivocally leads to overdose prevention centers as the next medically necessary best practice available to us. These centers are built upon a theoretical foundation called harm reduction. They are not based upon an abstinence-only model.
They engage people by providing what I’ve come to term “unconditional safety,” a stigma-free, non-punitive meeting of the person “where they are” emotionally, while they are using drugs. We meet them there and move forward with them at their pace, toward progressively less harm to themselves and the community.
We are making progress in this process here in Burlington, which will culminate in our opening an overdose prevention center. This is supported by Act 178, based upon H.72 as passed by the Legislature in 2024.
The city of Burlington has entered into an agreement with Vermonters for Criminal Justice Reform, the ideal provider for this life-saving service, which will be called the Downtown Health Project.
This arrangement was approved by the unanimous vote of our City Council on April 28 and since has been approved by the Vermont Department of Health. This process will continue, most hopefully at an urgent pace, the most pressing task facing us being the location of a suitable site.
Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak’s office is presently fully engaged in a comprehensive process outlined by the Vermont Department of Health in the department’s “Vermont Overdose Prevention Center Operating Guidelines.” Part of these guidelines require community input and City Council approval regarding site selection.
If you are undecided regarding this crucial public health intervention please educate yourself. Here are some resources:
A comprehensive website with current information on OPCs   
Vermont Department of Health operating guidelines for the OPC   
I am calling upon Burlingtonians to ask their City Council representatives to stand strongly on science and lead with compassion, to approve locating our OPC at a site that is immediately accessible to those most in need, once this site is determined by Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak’s team. This will support the overdose prevention center’s success which will begin to reduce our common suffering.
The science is clear on this, the need is pressing, and the pieces are in place. Without the will of the people nothing will be done and our common suffering will no doubt increase still.
The choice is ours.

We gathered to acknowledge the human toll of political decisions. Namely, the federal budget bill that had been looming. 
And we were there that night for the 2.6 million, but we were there to recognize the people behind that number. People like Paul, 66 years old, who has worked his entire life and now depends on Medicaid for mental health treatment. Without it, he fears losing access to the care and medication that keep him stable.
People like Catherine, who lives with cerebral palsy and relies on Medicaid to afford the direct care workers who help her with daily tasks like showering and transportation. Without this support, her independence would vanish. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Nathan spoke powerfully about how Medicaid helped him get sober, rebuild his life, and become a mentor to others fighting addiction. And Katie shared the story of her son, born 11 weeks premature and dependent on round-the-clock care. Thanks to Medicaid, he’s now a thriving 6-year-old who has overcome incredible odds.
These stories — and so many others — remind us that Medicaid isn’t just a policy. It’s a lifeline. It covers nearly half of all births in Michigan. It’s the largest payer of behavioral health services, long-term supports and nursing home care. In rural counties across our state, more than 1 in 5 residents rely on it. And beyond its human impact, Medicaid brings nearly $5 billion into Michigan’s economy each year. Cutting it would not only devastate families, it would destabilize entire communities and systems.
And it’s not just Medicaid many of us have been fighting for. Dozens of programs have been under attack by the federal administration. Programs that keep Michiganders safe and healthy. Programs that make sure food is on the table. Programs that help kids and families and communities.
But just days after our vigil, Republican leaders in Washington passed one of the most dangerous and destructive bills in modern history. They voted to spend trillions of dollars in a way that will increase poverty and hunger, strip health care from millions, and push the largest transfer of wealth from working families to the wealthy elite this country has ever seen.

The bill will slash Medicaid and food assistance, which will not only drive families deeper into poverty, but will have devastating impacts on our food and health care systems. And to be quite frank, it will lead to more widespread death, disease and disability. Millions of Americans are at risk, and every state and territory will face extreme cuts. Michigan alone will have to come up with $8.5 billion in Medicaid expansion funds and up to $304 million in SNAP funds that the bill strips away from our state budget. 
700,000 Michiganders are at risk of losing health coverage. More than 120,000 could lose access to food. These are not just numbers. They are our neighbors, our co-workers, our grandparents and our kids.
But it gets worse. The bill also funnels billions toward a sweeping “mass deportation plan” that hands unchecked authority to the Trump administration. It lacks transparency, offers no clear oversight and sets the stage for dangerous abuses of power. All of this — plus $2.4 trillion added to the national deficit — was jammed through with little debate, often after meetings in the dead of night, because lawmakers knew how deeply unpopular it was.
Most Americans oppose this bill — and for good reason. Nearly 70% of the tax cuts will go to the wealthiest 20% of Americans. Meanwhile, families with the lowest incomes will see just a 1% reduction, and most will end up paying more out of pocket because they’re losing access to critical services. 
This is a generational setback. But it is also a call to action. We will not forget these stories. We will not stop fighting. And we will not let this become our future.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/healthcaregetty2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-11 07:06:53.732535

(Courtesy of Puget Sound Energy)Officials are warning that the megabill passed last week will likely raise Washington households’ electricity costs and eliminate thousands of jobs in Washington’s clean energy and manufacturing sectors.
The federal legislation doesn’t override Washington’s goal to fully transition all electric utilities in the state to clean energy by 2045, but it makes the work more challenging. 
“We have these great programs that are working, and now’s a great time to double down on those absent federal leadership so that we truly are getting to these goals, which we think we can still do,” said James Hove, the Washington state director of Climate Solutions, a nonprofit that seeks to accelerate clean energy solutions to address the global climate crisis. 
The new law  increases the requirements for developers to claim tax breaks  for wind, solar and other renewable energy projects, and fully does away with those incentives by 2028. 
New projects must be under construction by the end of the year to qualify for the lucrative credits.
The tax credits, passed by Congress in 2022, have generated $978 million in new private-led investment across seven energy manufacturing facilities in Washington, according to analysis by think tank Energy Innovation. 
Due to the phase out of those tax credits, an additional $8.75 billion in outstanding investments to 27 facilities in Washington is at risk. 
The data has been cited by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of 24 governors, including Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, committed to advancing state-led, high-impact climate action. 
Calling the rollbacks “a disastrous step in the wrong direction,” Ferguson said the legislation threatens Washington’s energy security and electric grid reliability at a time of soaring electricity demand. 
Clean energy projects scheduled to begin construction by the end of the year can continue as planned. But many will likely be delayed or stopped as developers scramble to find other funding sources to overcome the loss of federal assistance..
“We’re stopping production of certain energy. We don’t have enough energy as it is and … it’s not like we have other forms that are going to take that place right away,” Hove said. 
Washington committed to switching from fossil fuel-generated electricity to clean energy alternatives with passage of the Clean Energy Transformation Act in 2019, so reinvesting in fossil fuels to power the grid isn’t a realistic option. 
“You don’t just on a dime switch things and have those things be reversed,” Hove said. 
The infrastructure needed to produce electricity from fossil fuels is expensive and harmful to both people and the environment, Hove said. It’s why the state, prioritized investing in clean energy. 
“It’s cheaper … and more sustainable and more resilient to climate impacts to have a grid that’s based around those types of resources,” Hove said. 
The U.S. Climate Alliance estimates that the decline in clean energy projects as a result of the law will cause electricity costs for Washington households to increase by $115 per year by 2029. 
Homeowners can still qualify for credits of up to 30% of the cost of clean energy home improvement projects through Dec. 31. But because construction must be underway by the end of the year, making use of those credits will be difficult for Washingtonians who haven’t already started their projects. 
A controversial excise tax on wind and solar was not included in the final bill, but the bill does maintain and expand subsidies for fossil fuel industries.
“This bill is anything but beautiful for Washington. It’s a fossil fuel wish list that penalizes clean energy and favors pollution,” Ferguson said in a news release last week. 
Job loss is also a concern, as the U.S. Climate Alliance estimates that 21,800 Washingtonians in the clean energy and manufacturing sectors will lose their jobs by 2030 due to the loss of tax credits, according to information released by Ferguson’s office last week. 
Thousands of electricians are already unemployed in Washington due to long project permitting processes, energy shortages, grid unreliability and other investment-related issues, according to Matthew Hepner, the executive director of Certified Electrical Workers of Washington. 
The law will only exacerbate the problems, Hepner said.  
Washington has been slow to permit projects under the Clean Energy Transformation Act, but projects are now at the point where people are being hired for the work, Hepner said. 
“And now they’re drying up at the worst possible time,” he said. 
Certified Electrical Workers of Washington represents the six Washington chapters of the labor union International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which have a combined total of about 11,000 members. 
The bill directly threatens jobs by cutting funding to existing and future energy projects while sending the subsidies to oil refineries, Hepner said. 
Energy Innovation estimates that if the 27 projects with funding at risk don’t go forward, Washington will directly lose 10,000 jobs in 2030 and another 9,500 in 2035. 
While the forecast is bleak, Climate Jobs Washington, a coalition of labor unions,  is encouraging state and local leaders to continue pursuing clean energy projects in the state.
“Clean energy is our greatest opportunity to build an affordable economy in Washington State, with good union jobs for workers and a stronger, more reliable electrical grid. That doesn’t stop today, even if federal leaders strip away support for this vision,” Climate Jobs Washington said in a statement ahead of the megabill’s signing. . 
Hove remains optimistic.
“We’re incredibly grateful to have such a resilient state, and we’re well positioned to still lead on this,” Hove said. “But it certainly does not help to have this bill go through like it did.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Wild-Horse_turbines.jpg,,,2025-07-11 07:06:53.732535

(Getty Images)Indiana’s GOP supermajorities are taking a hands-on approach to higher education. From ending diversity efforts to cracking down on tenure and making syllabi postings mandatory, conservatives are seizing more control on public universities and colleges that receive state funding.
The latest move is to eliminate lesser-used degree programs. Leaders inserted language into the state budget that targets programs when the average number of students who graduate over the immediately preceding three years is fewer than:

10 for an associate degree program
15 for a bachelor’s degree program
seven for a master’s degree program
three for a doctorate degree program
three for an education specialist program

The educational institution can seek an exception from the Indiana Commission for Higher Education.
The mandated contraction raises a lot of questions. Yes, it could be better for the budget of the institution and therefore the state budget but isn’t part of government’s role to fund items for the public good? Public higher education is still a business and I’m concerned that customers  — i.e. Hoosier students — will go elsewhere to get what they need. Is that what Indiana wants?
An initial review by higher education officials identified a stunning 408 programs to be eliminated, suspended or merged. That’s nearly 20% of the degree offerings in the state.
Among those being terminated:

A bachelor’s degree in teaching German at Ball State University
A fine arts master’s degree in visual arts at Ball State University
Bachelor’s degrees in education for physics, chemistry and math at Indiana University Bloomington
An associate’s degree of applied science in public safety at Ivy Tech Community College
A master’s degree in public administration at Purdue Fort Wayne
A master’s degree in accountancy at University of Southern Indiana

A recent Newsweek article said Indiana’s Republican Gov. Mike Braun has called for more practical degrees that lead students into jobs, but the alterations to Hoosier higher education also come at a time when colleges across the country are coming under increasing scrutiny over funding and the programs they offer.
I have to admit, I’m torn on this one. I think I would feel better about the move if the idea was actually vetted publicly during the legislative session instead of, once again, inserting it into a bill with only a few days left and no advance notice. This type of move isn’t good for building trust in the legislative process and automatically puts people off.
Ohio, for example, appears to have an almost identical measure — which means it’s being pushed nationally. Senate Bill 1 in Ohio requires public universities to eliminate undergraduate degree programs that graduate fewer than five students a year over a three-year period.
On one hand, if only a handful of students are pursuing the degrees, it seems to make financial sense to assess whether these programs are worth the cost.

But I also think students should be able to pick the degrees they want if they are spending tens of thousands of dollars on it. This move also makes it harder for students to customize their educational paths to their interests.
West Lafayette Democratic Rep. Chris Campbell said when she received her master’s in audiology at Purdue it was a relatively small program.
“But the size of the program didn’t matter. It was offered because students were interested, and even though the discipline is small, audiologists provide essential services,” she said.
“This is an overreach of government into higher education, echoing a dangerous national trend. The majority isn’t outright controlling students’ education, but they’re restricting it, which achieves the same goal. Students should be able to study whatever they choose, especially since they’re paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. Programs impacted include economics, secondary education, finance and three engineering disciplines. I was especially shocked to see special education degrees on the list.”
Workforce shortages have turned into a major thorn for state leaders, and this move is clearly a way to push students into specific industries and sectors that business and state leaders want to emphasize to fill open jobs in Indiana.
But nothing will cause burnout and transiency in employment more than not loving what you do.
And if the degree options aren’t here, young Hoosiers will go elsewhere.

(Getty Images)Florida is stepping up its efforts to help abate veteran suicide by agreeing to spend $300,000 this year to expand statewide a suicide prevention program that now operates in only a handful of counties.
SB 116, which passed the Legislature unanimously and was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis last month, goes beyond mental health services, though, directing the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs (FDVA) to also develop a statewide plan to establish adult day health care facilities across the state to serve veterans and their families.

“This was our big bill, and we are very excited about the stuff in it. I mean, it’s, really good stuff,” the agency’s deputy executive director, Bob Asztalos, told the Florida Phoenix.
The National Library of Medicine notes that “suicide is a major public health challenge that disproportionately affects service members and veterans.” And for the past 12 years, suicide rates have been consistently higher among veterans than nonveterans.
Six hundred and twenty-two Florida military veterans killed themselves in 2023, the latest available data. That’s a dip from 655 veteran suicides in 2022 but an increase from the 612 who killed themselves in 2021.










This was our big bill, and we are very excited about the stuff in it. I mean, it's, really good stuff.


– FDVA Deputy Executive Director Bob Asztalos


Asztalos expects the expanded suicide training to become available for veteran service officers in the fall. These staff are co-located at U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs outpatient clinics, VA medical centers, and VA regional offices across the state. They understand federal and state laws regarding veteran benefits and help veterans navigate the system.
“They’re like our frontline troops, right? They’re out there in the field meeting with veterans every day, and so this is great training for them, because they’re the ones who run across the veterans who are, you know, having suicidal thoughts,” Asztalos said.
He added that the program won’t be limited to state employees but will include county-level staff who work with the The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
“We’re going to open it up to any [service officer] who works day-to-day with veterans in crisis,” Asztalos said.
Asztalos said the agency will turn to The Fire Watch to help with  education efforts.  Through its “Watch Stander” program, that organization has helped drive down the veteran suicide rates in Duval, Clay, Baker, St. Johns, and Nassau counties since launching in 2019. Although veteran suicide rates in Florida dropped by 5% between 2019 and 2023, it dropped by 25% during the same period in the five northeast Florida counties served by The Fire Watch, Florida Department of Health data show.
Asztalos said he expects the expanded suicide prevention offerings to become available in the fall.
Eradicating veteran suicide in Florida

No ketamine for vets
  Jon Albert via Florida House
U.S. Marne Corps veteran and state Rep. Jon Albert  submitted a funding request for a five-year study into the effects of ketamine for the treatment of major depressive disorder among veterans and first responders. The $300,000 would have covered the first year of study preparation, regulatory approvals, staff hiring, and software programming. The goal was to begin treatment cycles for up to 250 veterans and first responders.
The study would have involved a large scale multidisciplinary team with input from University of Florida VA faculty and a Johns Hopkins collaborator, among others.
The Legislature included in the state fiscal year 2025-26 budget but Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed it.
The Journal of American Medicine in 2017 published a consensus statement highlighting the need for study of ketamine use for depression and mood disorders. Esketamine, a form of ketamine, is FDA-approved for managing depression that hasn’t responded to standard treatments. Ketamine itself is used off-label to treat depression.
Asztalos said the FDVA never took a position on funding the five-year study.

Joining the ranks of VA adult day care
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs allows the  use of  adult day care program for veterans who reside at home but need help with activities of daily living such as bathing, grooming, and eating. Only New York and Iowa now are taking advantage of  the adult day care centers, which can be located at VA facilities, such as nursing homes and hospitals, Asztalos said.
Florida will join those ranks when it opens a new VA nursing home in Collier County, Asztalos said, with plans to build an adult day care facility at the new home. Construction is expected to begin next year and it is anticipated to open in July 2029.
The new law directs the FDVA to develop a plan to establish centers across the state. In considering locations, the state must consider sites that will do the most good for the veteran population and estimate the costs of running the facilities. The report is due to the governor and Legislature on Nov. 1.
Asztalos estimates the facilities will cost about $10 million to construct.
“I would love to start opening up some adult day health cares in conjunction with our existing nursing homes,” he said.
While that’s his goal, he thinks the first two locations for the VA adult day care centers would be Port St. Lucie and Lake City. FDVA also has been approached by a town in South Florida with a vacant building they’d like to turn into an adult day care center.
“We’re going to go down and talk to them and see, so I envision we’re going to give them two, maybe three locations to start,” Asztalos said of the report.
The costs to provide the services would mostly come from the federal government and, Asztalos said, the centers could generate revenue if the state keeps the costs below what the federal government provides to pay for the services. The VA nursing homes until recently have been revenue generators for the state, he said. Florida has nine VA facilities — eight nursing homes and one assisted living facility.
“Usually we make about $5 million a year [collectively]. I mean, COVID and a workforce shortage has thrown us all out of whack, but we’re getting back this year. This year, we’re down a little bit less than a million dollars in deficit, but next year we’ll be back in the black completely.”

A camping initiative for Black Hoosiers.
All are programs that have been abolished and even erased from their respective agency websites following an executive order by Gov. Mike Braun. The directive forced agencies to replace “diversity, equity and inclusion,” or DEI, throughout state government policies and programming with “merit, excellence and innovation.”
The January executive order gave agencies until July 1 to complete a review and identify DEI in their policies, which Braun released late Wednesday afternoon. In total, 350 DEI initiatives were identified and detailed across more than 3,800 pages of information. 


Examples of DEI in state government include:

70 different cases of training, instruction or programming that have been discontinued for state employees.
34 different grants within Indiana state agencies that had a condition based on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. 
Nearly 200 different DEI initiatives in state agency policy and procedures. 



Specifically, an executive summary highlighted an effort by the Department of Child Service to recruit and retain case managers “geared toward diversity and inclusion initiatives.” The report said this “created a favoritism … which could have the state missing out on valuable talent.”
Braun said “diversity and equality are hallmarks of what we believe as a country, but these top-down DEI mandates led to division and inefficiency by forcing decisions to flow through this office whose purpose was to achieve a political goal, rather than focused solely on maximizing results for Hoosiers on the kitchen table issues that affect their lives.”
But not all state leaders agree. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, a member of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, noted that many agencies had nothing to report, including the Department of Veteran Affairs as well as the Alcohol and Tobacco Commission. 
“There are a lot of agencies that didn’t even touch diversity, equity and inclusion at all. And the ones that did are the ones in which we see most disparities,” said Pryor.
When it comes to homeownership, health and other measures, Black Hoosiers often start out behind white Hoosiers, Pryor noted, meaning there isn’t a level playing field for everyone. Historic redlining and racism still impact Black Hoosiers when it comes to buying or selling a home while Black mothers die at higher rates than white mothers.
“It almost feels like it’s just an attack,” Pryor said.
Additionally, the deletion of previously public documents raises access concerns — and held an even deeper message to Pryor.
“It’s as if you’re saying the minority community were never here. You never existed. And that is an extremely dangerous policy that they’re implementing. And it should not go unchecked,” she warned.
 Health and human services

To comply with Braun’s executive order, the Family and Social Services Administration will be abolishing the Office of Healthy Opportunities, which former Gov. Eric Holcomb created to “work with communities served by the Administration to address factors influencing health outcomes, such as housing, education, transportation, and access to services.” 
Of the four-person team, which had two vacant positions as of January, just one will be kept: the director overseeing compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act because of a federal requirement. 
Doulas, midwives and lawmakers challenge erasure of Black women in maternal health care

The state agency will also be changing its mission and vision statements for various departments to eliminate the word “equity.” The previous mission statement for 211, for example, was: “To improve quality of life for Hoosiers by promoting equity and connecting people to health and human service resources through highly skilled navigators, continuous community collaboration and a robust community database, and technological innovations.”
The new mission statement for 211 will simply strike “promoting equity.” 
One of the agency’s previous values — inclusion, or the belief that “Diverse cultures, perspectives and ideas are the basis for agency growth” — will also be eliminated.
Contracts that included DEI requirements, including those specifying “equitable access” to services for older or disabled Hoosiers, will be amended to remove that language and 11 grants will be reworded. 
The Department of Child Services also eliminated an empty Strategic Equity position in September 2024 that was tasked with assessing barriers to the agency’s programs or services. Additionally, several reports offering advice to families navigating transracial adoption have disappeared and mission statements have been revised. 
IDOH will eliminate two positions outright: a disparities coordinator and a maternal health coordinator. Indiana has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the world — and Black mothers are more likely to die in the year following childbirth than their white counterparts. 
“I’m just disgusted. These were really no-brainers,” Pryor said about maternal health initiatives geared toward Black Hoosiers and eliminated positions seeking to eliminate health disparities.
  Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, speaks during an Indiana Black Legislative Caucus news conference on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“It is going to harm and hurt women,” Pryor continued. “… as the numbers get worse, that is going to lie at the feet of the governor and his policies.”
Maternal and infant mortality rates were a specific focus for the Holcomb administration — and rates appeared to fall, especially for infants. 
“If the numbers get worse for Black women, it’s going to get worse overall,” Pryor said about maternal mortality rates. “For this particular issue, you know, investing in maternal health for women, investing in the minority community, it also helps the majority community as well.”
Notably, the Office of Minority Health itself cannot be eliminated by executive order, because lawmakers put it into statute. But Pryor wondered whether that department could become a target in the upcoming legislative session.
A core tenet of officials in the health space has been the concept of health equity, which a 2017 Robert Johnson Wood Foundation report defines as “mean(ing) that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible.”
Incorporating the concept can “help bridge divides and foster productive dialogue … Conversely, a lack of clarity can lead to detours, and pose a barrier to effort engagement and action,” the health-focused organization warns.
The word equity was removed across several programs and IDOH grants, including those for fetal-infant mortality review and water safety. Additionally, the agency identified several grants to revise, including one that sought to set aside funds for LGBTQ+ sexual assault prevention services and support. It’s unclear what the revision may be, as the grant contract is one of dozens included in the 705-page DEI report focused on health programming. 
 DEI in education

Indiana’s public education offices — including the Department of Education and Commission for Higher Education — have eliminated diversity-focused offices, ended dozens of DEI training programs, and removed race- or identity-based references from grants, hiring rubrics and mission statements, according to a 444-page education addendum released alongside the statewide report.
Indiana colleges cut hundreds of low-enrollment degree programs ahead of state mandate

CHE, for example, eliminated its chief equity, inclusion, and opportunity officer earlier this year and has dissolved key functions related to that position. That office was previously responsible for reviewing campus climates, equity initiatives and spearheading public outreach to increase diversity across Hoosier colleges and universities.
The education department reported that none of its employee training programs focused on DEI and that it does not include race- or gender-related criteria in job applications. Still, IDOE purged a slew of outdated or non-compliant language across its website, with dozens of pages and documents flagged or removed.
The report also listed numerous changes to statewide education-related programs and materials, including a “high ability” teaching toolkit which was rewritten to remove references to equity and underrepresented groups. 
Videos in the department’s online learning lab that previously addressed inclusive classroom strategies and equity-focused science standards were additionally taken down, with others flagged for removal. A review of statewide academic standards further identified DEI language in subjects like social studies, ethnic studies and workplace readiness. State education officials said in the report that those standards are now undergoing revision.
The department has also contacted multiple professional organizations and state-contracted vendors to request they scrub DEI content from materials shared with Indiana educators.
Significant changes affected dozens of K-12 and higher education grant programs, too.

The STEM Teacher Recruitment Grant, which included funding for a “Black Teacher Residency” program focused on recruiting Black educators in underserved schools, will expire in August 2025 with no plans for renewal.

At least one initiative funded by the state’s Career Coaching Grant initiative was specifically tailored to support minority and low-income students. The program — administered by the higher education commission to fund career exploration activities in schools across the state — launched in March 2024 and grants will “naturally conclude” at the end of 2025, according to the governor’s report.
Two additional grant programs will also sunset at the end of 2025 after receiving no new funding in the current budget. The College Success Program, created in the 2023 budget to support minority and first-generation college students, issued grants to Indiana State, Purdue Northwest, and Valparaiso University — all of which included language supporting students of color or underrepresented backgrounds. 
Indiana State and Valparaiso have since redirected their funds to broader scholarship efforts, but Purdue Northwest had continued targeted programming as of April 2025. 
Housing, camping and more
The changes sprawl beyond health and education — to the agencies that promote Indiana’s public lands, foster its businesses, regulate its housing industry and more.
Braun’s directive, for instance, prompted the Department of Natural Resources to purge campfire-emblazoned flags and other merchandise from state facilities, strip stickers from state-owned vehicles and scrub trainings from its human resources platform. 
That’s because the campfire, dubbed a “unity blaze,” is the logo for North Carolina-based Black Folks Camp Too. Founder Earl B. Hunter Jr. launched the company to combat “generational fears” — like of lynchings — that Black people may hold of the outdoors, ABC 11 reported. 
Black Folks Camp Too offers training on “how to create a more inclusive outdoor experience for all,” according to a joint news release with DNR. 
The duo entered into a yearlong agreement in 2023 for $17,500 and renewed it in 2024 for $62,666, but under Braun’s executive order, DNR backed out two months early. The agency paid a final bill of $56,698, per the report.
The Indiana Economic Development Corporation, which spends millions annually to draw business into the Hoosier State and boost homegrown companies, also revised its efforts.










We're whitewashing everything


– Rep. Cherrish Pryor


One of 32 Community Collaboration Fund grants awarded in 2024 — designed for Hispanic women in the cleaning industry — was labeled inappropriate.
“During a call with the awardee, the (executive order) was shared along with guidance for compliance,” the report reads. “The final cohort of the program was opened to all (socially & economically disadvantaged individual) entrepreneurs in compliance with the (executive order). Projects chosen for inclusion for the 2025 program will strictly comply.”
The report specifically targeted economic development affiliate Elevate Ventures and its ElevateME program supporting non-white and female startup founders. The entity is separately facing allegations of financial impropriety and is under investigation. 
“The IEDC has communicated with Elevate regarding the use of state funds in conformance with” Braun’s directive, the report reads.
Tweaks are also coming to the massive Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative, which represents a collective $1 billion in state funding across two tranches. 
The report acknowledges that no statutory or programmatic requirements “explicitly” encourage DEI investments, but that IEDC’s key performance indicators — like increasing the state’s per-capita income and targeting federally defined disadvantaged communities — “could indirectly implicate” them. IEDC is planning changes to 12 READI-funded projects.
Other revisions could impact Indiana’s housing industry gatekeepers.
The Indiana Real Estate Commission was one of several entities overseen by the Public Licensing Agency that admitted to approving DEI-related continuing education courses. But it’s the only one that requires such training for licensure, according to the report.
The training includes an hour of instruction on listing agreements, an hour on fair housing laws and cultural diversity, and five hours on negotiating and counseling skills.
The agency will have the commission redraw its rules to “remove these specific requirements … to the extent that they can do so without violating the federal Fair Housing Act,” the report concludes.
In a statement, Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana Executive Director Amy Nelson noted that the 1968 law “protects all of us, in multiple ways, from discrimination that may occur in our housing transactions.” She said it’s “critical” that it “be part of any training curriculum for those in the housing industry and that outreach continues to inform housing consumers of their rights.”
Pryor said she found the changes disturbing. She has focused on barriers to homeownership for Black Hoosiers for years.
“When you look back and you consider the redlining that happened (due to) the federal government years ago (and) when you look at the gentrification that is happening right now, the last thing we need to do is pare back on anything,” Pryor said. 
Redlining is the historical practice of zoning Black and other minority homeowners into specific areas and not allowing them to purchase homes elsewhere — areas that were also targeted for redevelopment projects such as freeways, destroying years of built-up wealth. 
Deleting the public record?
Multiple state agencies reported removed or archived publicly accessible documents related to DEI, citing compliance with the executive order. But doing so raises concerns about accessibility to public records. 
Kris Cundiff, Indiana attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said “it’s usually concerning when the government — at any level — makes it more difficult for Hoosiers to access public records and information.”
But he noted that “regardless of who is in office, public records in Indiana are presumptively disclosable — by statute — upon request and subject to retention. This is true even if the government makes a policy change or removes public records from a website.”

Read the report, and the accompanying appendices, here.

For example, DCS removed several publications, including: “Parenting in Racially and Culturally Diverse Adoptive Families;” “Preparing Families for Racially and Culturally Diverse Adoptions;” and “We are all immigrants — learning about ourselves and our neighbors.”
FSSA archived old press releases and slide decks while the Department of Correction nixed select annual reports. The Indiana Professional Licensing Agency removed documents for 11 agency meetings.
“As the documents discussed above are required pursuant to Open Door Law, PLA will continue to follow its traditional archiving policies,” the agency said in the report. 
The Indiana Department of Transportation reported that meeting minutes from a Bloomington Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization meeting included a DEI focus group discussion. INDOT stated that such meetings fall under the Open Door Law’s requirements.
“It’s as if they’re trying everything that has happened in the past, and I think that is a very dangerous road that we’re going now. It’s one thing, if moving forward, you want to change a policy going forward,” Pryor said. “You don’t want your newsletters or blogs or websites to have information and presentations, but the fact that, in retrospect, they’re trying to basically erase the African American community completely out of the state of Indiana, is just mind boggling to me.
“(It’s) trying to erase me, and that is dangerous.”

Good Samaritan Haven plans for a “partial soft opening” this November and to be fully operational in January 2026, according to a recent press release.

This story by Matthew Thomas was first published in The Bridge on July 9.
The long search for the right site for a homeless shelter in Montpelier may be over. If all goes as planned, the former Central Vermont Solid Waste Management office at 137 Barre Street may soon house a new, permanent 18-bed emergency shelter.
In a June 21 press release, Good Samaritan Haven (central Vermont’s shelter network, also known as “Good Sam”) announced that it has signed a purchase and sale agreement for 137 Barre Street, a building that has gone up for sale because the solid waste management district has found a new home in Berlin. The building — a large blue Victorian style house — shares a driveway with Another Way, a “sanctuary for those with psychiatric disabilities,” according to its website, and an organization that, like Good Sam, offers an array of services to those without housing. 
Good Sam plans for a “partial soft opening” this November and to be fully operational in January 2026, the release noted.
Julie Bond, Good Sam’s executive director, said the organization provides services to 475 to 500 people annually through direct shelters, along with its community-, street- and motel-outreach program. 
The property will become a semi-congregate (”dorm-style”) shelter serving adults aged 18 to 80 plus, Bond said. Similar to Good Sam’s 17-bed flagship shelter in Barre, the Montpelier shelter will have multiple beds in each sleeping room, several common rooms, shared bathrooms, and a kitchen, along with laundry and staff offices, Bondadded. 
The new shelter will also provide housing case management and some community health case management onsite, said Bond. “These services will support and connect guests with housing opportunities, job training opportunities, connection to social services and medical and mental health partners in the area,” she added, along with visiting service providers from community partners. 
Aligning with Montpelier’s housing plan, the city has been “wonderfully supportive,” of the new shelter, Bond said. “We’ve been providing seasonal/winter shelter for the last several years, and it’s very intense and resource-heavy to ramp up, operate, and ramp down each season versus operating a shelter year round.” 
In order to create a more grounded and settled environment, Bond said, “Guests will not have to leave during the day … allowing folks to heal, settle, and have the time, space, and peace to meet their housing and other goals.” 
Another important feature of the Barre Street site, Bond said, is that it sits well out of the floodplain. Two of their current shelters are flood-prone, and safely sheltering guests is an organizational priority, she said.
Good Samaritan is a 90-day program, said Bond, although longer-than-average stays may happen because of the state’s housing crisis. During this time, guests receive assistance meeting their housing goals. The program has a standard intake process and is not a drop-in shelter. None of its shelters currently serve families, she said.
“With the motel exodus this week,” said Bond, “we will be supporting many more people who must leave the motels after their 80 days have run out and they have nowhere else to go but to tent outdoors, exposed to the elements.” She added that most are living with major medical, cognitive, developmental, or mental health challenges. 
Along with the city of Montpelier, Good Sam is working with the state of Vermont’s Office of Economic Opportunity and the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and has hired Evernorth, a nonprofit focused on helping low- and moderate-income people across northern New England create affordable housing and make community investments. Together, Good Sam and Evernorth are working to secure the funding to acquire the property, Bond said. 
While still in the early stages, Bond said she looks forward to connecting with future neighbors of the new shelter to share plans of what she called a “steppingstone in this community.”
Of those experiencing homelessness in Vermont, Bond said, “The situation continues to be dire and we need more creative solutions while keeping people sheltered in place until those solutions are fully realized.”

The timing of many of the law’s changes is still uncertain.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“This bill was written very hastily,” said Tami Jackson, policy analyst for the Wisconsin Board for People with Development Disabilities (BPDD), at a discussion of the law Thursday morning in the Wisconsin Capitol.
“There are implementation dates for various pieces of Medicaid that are not all in alignment,” Jackson said. “So, you’re going to get this in waves.”
Janet Zander of the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources paraphrased promises from members of Congress who have publicly defended the bill.
“It’s really easy to listen to what we’re hearing about — ‘This isn’t going to harm us here in Wisconsin. We’re not doing anything that’s going to hurt older adults, people with disabilities, low-income families,’” Zander said. “Those of us who are working in these programs know that’s not the case at all.”
The new bill imposes requirements for Medicaid participants to work or be preparing for work — although a majority already are working — or else be approved as exempt from having to meet the requirement.
That provision’s implementation date of Jan. 1, 2027 is less than 18 months away, Jackson said. And it could be up to a year before the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces an administrative rule to direct states on how they manage the requirement.
That doesn’t allow for much time to work out “20 or 30 unanswered questions” about how to require people to demonstrate they’re working, qualify for an exemption or prove that they’re exempt, Jackson said.
The added requirements will also impose new demands on agencies in charge of implementing the Medicaid changes in each state, as well as county agencies that help people navigate the program.
“If you are ramping up the workload and how much people have to do, and ramping up the staffing it takes to do that, that’s a lot more that counties are going to be doing locally, or will have to do,” Jackson said. “That’s going to exacerbate how many people lose coverage.”
Other items have no implementation date — which is usually interpreted as taking effect with the bill’s signing, said William Parke-Sutherland, government affairs director at Kids Forward.
“This bill, which is being kind of talked about as a tax and spending bill, is really a health care redesign bill, and it makes the most substantive changes to the health care system that we’ve seen since the Affordable Care Act,” Parke-Sutherland said.
That national health care law had four years to be implemented. With the new Medicaid changes, “we have no time in comparison.”
But the probable long-term impact remains dire, advocates said — making it harder for people to get coverage and keep coverage.
Taking together the projected loss of Medicaid coverage as well as the projected loss of Affordable Care Act coverage for low-income people who lose subsidies for their premiums that expire at the end of this year, as many as 17 million people in the U.S. could lose health care and long-term care coverage, Zander said.
The state Department of Health Services estimated in April that at least 52,000 Wisconsin residents could lose Medicaid coverage. Changes the Senate made in the bill will likely increase those estimates, however, according to advocates.
Safety-net barriers, old and new
As ultimately passed by the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump, the legislation has thrown new barriers in front of the nation’s safety-net programs, including Medicaid as well as the federal food aid program, SNAP.
Existing barriers were already very high, advocates said.
Kathleen Cummings works for the Columbia County Aging and Disability Resource Center assisting people who are 60 or older applying for Medicaid and other benefit programs. Based on their annual income and total assets, some people on Medicare also qualify for Medicaid to cover their out-of-pocket Medicare costs.
Cummings recounted the experience of a woman who had qualified for Medicaid but recently contacted her because she was getting bills for her health care. The woman accidentally failed to renew her Medicaid coverage when the renewal form she received got buried in a flurry of other Medicaid-related mail, Cummings said.
Under current law the client can get coverage retroactively for bills incurred in the last three months. But with the new law, “that will be changing to 30 days, so we will not, in the future, be able to request that backdated coverage for bills under the situation that she is in,” Cummings said.
Another client has had extensive treatment for lung cancer, she said. The man “is just barely, barely over the federal poverty level” — about $1,300 a month.
“A lot of my clients are very proud and do what they can with what they have,” Cummings said. “But when something like lung cancer comes along, he’s suddenly faced with all these bills that he only had limited coverage [for].”
She’s helping the man apply for Medicaid coverage backdated three months to cover those bills, she said. “Once he shows proof that he qualified, which he will, [he can] get some of these bills paid.”
Nichole Robarge also works for the Columbia County ARDC, helping people from ages 16 to 59 who qualify for federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits and other programs.
Robarge said that currently the disability application takes 12 to 18 months for a decision. As many as 85% of applications are denied at first, she said, and about 20% get overturned on appeal, which takes another 18 to 24 months. A second appeal, with a hearing before an administrative law judge, can take another two years.
In Wisconsin, approval for SSI automatically qualifies a person for Medicaid coverage. Until the SSI decision is resolved, however, the applicant has to apply for Medicaid separately, Robarge said — something that a disability can make much more difficult.
She pulled out the Medicaid application, which currently must be completed annually — a 41-page document that is a half-inch thick.
“Can you imagine getting one of these in the mail and having a cognitive disability or a physical disability, or maybe you had a stroke?…Or maybe you can’t read at all,” Robarge said.
“I bought a house and had less paperwork. I’ve bought a car and I’ve had less paperwork than what it takes to fill one of these out,” she added. “It’s tedious and it’s treacherous … This first barrier is huge, and this is even without getting the documents that you need to provide the proof that they’re asking for.”
Unintended consequences
The new law is poised to make those delays worse, advocates argue — blocking people from Medicaid coverage even though they meet the program’s qualifications.
“Medicaid is a wildly complicated program,” said Lisa Hassenstab, public policy manager for Disability Rights Wisconsin. “What we’ve seen in this bill is that all of these little changes [and] the unintended consequences, because people don’t understand what the program is. They don’t understand what it is, and so they don’t understand what the impact of these changes is really going to be.”
One thing the bill won’t do, advocates said, is protect taxpayers.
“It won’t protect me,” said Tyler Engel, whose Medicaid coverage enables him to live more independently in the community with coverage for his caregivers.
“This bill saves money by making it so that, for somebody who is now currently eligible for health care, the provider who provides that care is not going to get paid,” Parke-Sutherland said. “This saves money by people who are currently eligible for health insurance” with federal help “not getting health insurance or having to pay more for it. That’s the only way that this bill saves money.”
Two-thirds of Medicaid participants are working, and therefore they are taxpayers, too, Jackson said.
“It’s a cost shift to the taxpayers,” said Jackson, because when people aren’t covered by Medicaid, “somebody else picks that up — whether it’s uncompensated care, whether it’s a medical bankruptcy, whether it’s your private insurance or your group premium going up.”
“If you stop paying for care, people’s care needs don’t go away,” Parke-Sutherland said. “You still pay. So this isn’t a boon to the taxpayers.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma lawmakers may be headed in the right direction with a new law that bans cellphone use during the school day in a bid to improve student focus, mental health and classroom performance.
But as districts craft policies to comply with Senate Bill 139, I hope they’ll also think beyond the confines of their school buildings and consider what could happen when students grab their phones the moment the final bell rings and head to the parking lot.
Car crashes are the leading cause of death for young people aged 15-24 nationally and in Oklahoma. Drivers ages 16-19 are nearly three times as likely to be in a fatal crash compared to drivers over 20. While not often seen as a health threat by the general public, motor vehicle crashes have been recognized as one by the medical community, including the Oklahoma State Medical Association Foundation. For several years, the group has supported efforts to address this dire problem. 
A prime place to tackle this challenge is where students spend most of their time — school.
The most dangerous time of day for teen drivers is between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. For many teens, the school parking lot is the most dangerous place they visit as a driver and a pedestrian. It’s a chaotic environment full of distractions — music, friends waving and students walking between cars. Add phones into the mix, and the risks skyrocket. 
In a recent national survey, 37% of Oklahoma teens surveyed admitted to using their device while driving in the past 30 days. Notably, the top-ranked reason for using their phones while driving was concern about parents or guardians being upset if they didn’t reply.
Schools can’t afford to ignore what happens in those crucial minutes after dismissal. When students rush to check texts, post on social media or respond to Snapchats the moment they get behind the wheel, everyone is at risk. 
Lawmakers have given school leaders a golden opportunity to be bold and creative, not just during the school day, but also in managing the transition from the classroom to the road.
Schools could lead the way in developing proactive solutions through encouraging a positive safety culture to mitigate potential increases in risky driving behaviors by creating a post-dismissal time for students to check cellphones or designating “tech zones” in common areas where they can safely check messages before leaving campus. Districts could post signs reminding students to wear seatbelts and put their phones down, sparking real behavior change.  
This new law provides an opportunity for schools, parents, and students to have meaningful discussions about safe driving attitudes and practices – and this momentum could change habits where it matters most – before students ever put the key in the ignition.

Idaho’s fourth member of Congress, U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, did not receive a letter and voted to oppose the Public Lands in Public Hands Act, the Utah News Dispatch previously reported.
More than 60% of the land in Idaho is public land of some sort, and outdoor recreation on public lands is a major driver of the state’s economy and a lifeblood for businesses and workers in some small communities located near recreational areas.
Rep. Rod Furniss, R-Rigby, signed the public lands letter and posted a photo of it to social media July 1 with a caption stating “No selling of public lands in Idaho!”
In a phone interview Monday with the Idaho Capital Sun, Furniss said there was a “groundswell of grassroots support” from the public for keeping public land public.

“When this came out my mailbox exploded again,” Furniss said. “I heard Idahoans all over the state say they are against any public land being sold.” 
Only Republicans were asked to sign the June 30 public lands letter, with signers including House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star; Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Burley; House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian; and Senate Majority Leader Lori Den Hartog, R-Meridian.
At issue was a proposal included in an earlier version of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.” Before he removed the proposal, U.S. Sen Mike Lee, R-Utah, led efforts to include a proposal that would have allowed millions of acres of public land to be sold in the West, including in Idaho, States Newsroom and the Washington State Standard previously reported.
Simpson, Crapo and Risch provided public Republican opposition to the public lands sell-off, with Simpson co-sponsoring the federal Public Lands in Public Hands Act and Crapo and Risch announcing their public opposition June 20 to the public lands sell off component of the budget reconciliation process.
 Idaho Dems celebrate death of public lands, criticize Republican response

On July 3, Idaho Senate Democrats wrote an opinion piece published by the Idaho Statesman celebrating the death of the public lands selloff.

In the opinion piece, Democrats credited the people of Idaho and the West who love public lands – hunters, campers, fishing enthusiasts, skiers, boaters, hikers, bird watchers, ranchers who graze livestock, rafters, ATV users, snowmobilers and more – with killing the proposal to sell public lands. 
“Some of the loudest voices were not of our politicians; they were yours,” Democrats wrote in the piece, which Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise; and Sens. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello; Janie Ward-Engelking, D-Boise; Ali Rabe, D-Boise; Carrie Semmelroth, D-Boise; and Ron Taylor, D-Hailey, signed.
In an interview Tuesday, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said that support of public lands should not be a partisan issue that only Republicans or Democrats can support. 
Rubel also challenged her Republican colleagues in the Idaho Legislature to turn their support of public lands into policy action, not just a letter.
Rubel criticized Republicans in the Idaho Senate who sent a bipartisan public lands bill, House Bill 129, out for amendments, which ultimately resulted in the bill being killed when the 2025 legislative session adjourned in April. 
If passed into law, the bill would have extended the amount of time money could be held in the Idaho land bank fund to purchase public lands from five years to 10 years. 
Under state law, the land bank fund is used to hold money from the sale of state endowment lands for the purposes of acquiring other land.

But with the death of the bill, Rubel said that tens of millions of dollars that would have been available to acquire or purchase more public lands in Idaho is going away.
“Certainly I appreciate every voice from every end of the political spectrum speaking up in defense of public lands, because it should never be a partisan issue,” Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun. “But I wish the same zeal for protecting public lands had been manifested during the session when Senate Republicans killed one of the main bills protecting public lands in Idaho.”
Democrats also included another message in their op-ed – if public lands can come under threat once, they can come under threat again.
“We cannot afford to be complacent; we must continue to fight for our public lands and so much more,” Democrats wrote.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/44903867992_5d20d52ca3_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-11 07:06:53.732535

Solar and wind remain the fastest-growing, cheapest form of energy in the nation and in Wyoming.
The post Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ creates economic obstacle for renewable energy in Wyoming, observers say appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s top politicians have heaped praise on President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” for giving the state’s flagging fossil fuel industries a boost. They’ve also taken swipes at past congressional efforts to support wind and solar — the cheapest and fastest-growing energy sector in the nation, including in the Equality State, federal data shows.
While promoting coal, oil and natural gas via tax breaks, the bill includes several punishing policies for wind and solar: chiefly, a much quicker phase out of tax credits that industry experts say will jeopardize hundreds of projects. The result will be higher electric bills and unfulfilled job growth in a stunted electrical power sector, according to initial reactions and analysis in the industry.
“Today’s Congressional action is a dramatic swing in federal policy, disrupting the good faith investments of American companies that are powering our economy and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a prepared statement.
Such grim predictions apply to Wyoming, where electricity customers may experience a 29% increase over the next decade, according to one analysis. There are also several wind and solar developers in the state who were counting on the tax credits for a longer period. How many of those projects might squeak forward and how many may fall by the wayside is difficult to say. But some industry watchers, and politicians, in Wyoming warn that the long-term implications will not be good for ratepayers or local governments.

“There’s a clear intent to shut down the renewable sector in the [One Big Beautiful Bill Act],” Laramie Democratic Sen. Chris Rothfuss told WyoFile. “While there’s a lot of visceral disdain for the renewable sector among many residents and many legislators, the reality is it’s an important part of our economy and an important part of our forward-looking economy.”
Others suggest there’s more support for renewable energy in Wyoming than people may realize. 
Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Associate Jonathan Williams said he joined several city council members and other local officials from Wyoming on a recent trip to Washington, D.C. They implored congressional representatives to maintain support for clean energy, including programs that help municipalities, schools and small businesses cut costs via energy audits and solar panel installation. 
Local governments in Wyoming increasingly want to cut their energy costs, Williams noted, yet all of the programs are on shaky ground.
“I think that’s a loss when we’re thinking about, ‘What does this mean for ratepayers, or for businesses, or for investment in our state that we need for keeping our state attractive to young people?'” Williams said. “I don’t know how many people are moving here for coal jobs when the market is deciding it doesn’t want coal.”
Disappearing tax credits
The Trump administration is moving swiftly to strip clean electricity tax credits for wind and solar projects following passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
This chart depicts the rate at which renewable energy is outpacing coal on the power grid. (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis)
The president signed an executive order Monday directing the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” 
For the most part, projects must begin construction before July 4, 2026 and be operational by the end of 2027, shaving several years off the previous eligibility timeline. 
That means hundreds of project developers across the nation are rushing to move up construction starts — a particular challenge considering that permitting can take years, not to mention the administration has signaled it doesn’t prioritize such efforts. 
Some in the renewable energy industry also worry about potential tax credit eligibility clawbacks, noting that Trump’s executive order directs federal agencies to place extra scrutiny on what qualifies as beginning construction. The order proclaims that commercial wind and solar development “denigrates the beauty of our nation’s natural landscape,” “displaces” affordable domestic energy sources, is “unreliable” and poses a threat to national security for relying on supplies from “foreign entities of concern.”
Gov. Mark Gordon praised Congress for tax and royalty rollbacks for coal, oil and natural gas, noting those industries are “critical to Wyoming’s fiscal health.” His press statement following the bill’s passage last week, however, made no mention of the increasing role wind and solar play in Wyoming.

“Wyoming voted overwhelmingly for President Trump for his embrace of free enterprise, freedom and his promise to cut government,” Gordon said. “I am optimistic about our economy, but remain concerned about a burgeoning federal deficit.”
Wind and solar in Wyoming
Wyoming generates about 10,200 megawatts of electricity from all sources, according to state and federal data. Nearly one-third comes from wind and solar. More than half the electrons generated here are exported to customers outside the state.
One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.
One wind energy project alone, Power Company of Wyoming’s Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Carbon County, will add more than 3,500 megawatts of electrical generation capacity, boosting the state’s power generation by 34%.
The 600-turbine project qualifies for federal tax credits, despite backing from billionaire Phil Anschutz. Construction of the massive “power plant” technically began in 2016, according to the company, and work kicked into high gear about a year ago. The project remains on track, “and is continuing construction,” a company spokesperson told WyoFile via email. Developers plan to begin producing wind energy in phases, and potentially put the project in full-capacity operation in 2030.

The 330-megawatt Boswell Springs wind facility in Albany County came online recently, according to local reports. NextEra Energy’s 390-megawatt Cedar Springs IV wind project in Converse County is expected to be in operation this year, as is Invenergy’s 590-megawatt Rock Creek wind energy project in Albany County.
Those are all major additions to Wyoming’s electrical generation industry. But the fate of numerous other renewable energy projects is unknown. Nearly a dozen wind and solar projects have come before the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council since 2020, according to a WyoFile review. Each touts hundreds of construction jobs, dozens of permanent and ancillary jobs and significant revenues via rents to landowners and property taxes. 
Wyoming is one of the few states in the nation that imposes a tax on wind energy generation, producing millions of dollars each year that are split between the state and the counties hosting wind power plants. One “good” thing in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act for clean energy, proponents say, is a new cost-share that will split federal rents and fees with local governments hosting wind and solar facilities. That may give the industry more favorability with local governments, they speculate.
“Honestly, here in Albany County, we have such a poor assessed valuation that property tax is a little bit hard to come by,” Rothfuss said. “And for that matter, this year’s sales and use tax is being buoyed by the wind projects. So we know that our community’s counting on that revenue.” 
But there’s no full accounting of wind and solar projects in the early planning stages that may be at risk due to the accelerated phase-out of federal tax credits.
Each project also touts its avoided carbon dioxide emissions as an alternative to fossil-fueled power plants. That’s also in Wyoming’s interest, “because the science is clear about where we are headed in terms of emissions and what that means in terms of a warming climate and weather extremes,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Policy Director John Burrows told WyoFile.A recent University of Wyoming survey revealed that Wyoming residents are increasingly concerned about climate change — particularly for its impact on water resources — and that they want their elected officials to do something about it.

The post WyoGives provides once-a-year boost to critical Wyoming organizations  appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s biggest single day of charitable giving — WyoGives — is this Wednesday, July 16th. 
An initiative of the Wyoming Nonprofit Network, WyoGives provides a platform for more than 430 Wyoming nonprofits to reach a statewide network of donors, and millions of dollars in much-needed support. 
In a state that prides itself on self-reliance and being neighborly, these organizations take up much of the slack and provide services that thousands of Wyomingites rely on. In turn, many of them rely on WyoGives for a significant shot in the arm.
Since its first year in 2020, WyoGives has raised more than $14 million for hundreds of nonprofits, growing from a half million dollars in its first year to an impressive $4.6 million given by nearly 8,000 donors in 2024. Since 2021, the Hughes Charitable Foundation has generously boosted donations with a $1 million gift each year, amplifying the individual support those charities receive.
“WyoGives is a celebration of people coming together to amplify the work of nonprofits across Wyoming, showcasing the incredible impact that happens when we unite in the spirit of giving,” said Jody Shields, executive director of the Wyoming Nonprofit Network.
Our state’s lean public administration asks a lot of the philanthropic sector. In true Wyoming fashion, its citizens roll up their sleeves and do the work to make our communities livable and help them thrive.
“This year is particularly important,” Shields added, “as some of our nonprofits are facing funding cutbacks while the demand for services continues to rise.”

According to the Wyoming Nonprofit Network’s site, participating organizations support: animals, arts and culture, community advocacy, disability services, disaster relief, education, emergency response, environment, health and wellness, homelessness and housing, substance abuse prevention, veterans, volunteerism, youth services and more.
One 2024 participating organization reported, “WyoGives is such an incredible endeavor. It gets all participating nonprofits statewide in one place and demonstrates a truly cohesive community that comes together and supports one another.”
All participating organizations and service categories are listed on their categories page. Donors can contribute to any number of organizations they like at wyogives.org.

Not everyone opted to join the noisy revelry of rodeos or parades, however.

“Our low-interest loan program has helped hundreds of growers make conservation improvements,” Terry Hoebelheinrich, loan officer for the Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission, said in a written statement. “We want to make sure that all of our farmers and ranchers in the state know that our loan program exists and is open and available for applications. We have significant resources available to assist producers across the state.”
Wayne Hungate, an agriculture producer in Canyon County, used a low interest loan to finance a new sprinkler system. The commission said the project allowed Hungate to double the capacity of his private pasture lands and double the capacity of his cattle herd.
“I could not have made those improvements without the Commission’s loan program,” Hungate said in a written statement. “It’s been a fun one – I’ve always wanted to try intensive grazing techniques on my own, and it’s been working really well.”
Potential projects that can be financed through the low interest loan program include irrigation systems, minimum till and no till drills, livestock fences, stockwater systems for pastures and grazing land, conservation improvements to livestock feeding operations, culvert replacement, hard rock stream crossings and more, the commission said. 
To apply to participate in the low interest loan program, farmers or ranchers should develop a conservation plan with the commission’s assistance that identifies a resource problem and a solution. A local soil and conservation district will then review and rank the plans. Officials said the conservation plan submitted for the application can be a simple, one page plan.
Ag operators interested in more information about the low interest loan program may email or call Hoebelheinrich at terry.hoebelheinrich@swc.idaho.gov or 208-332-1793.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Bringing to market new and innovative product lines is usually one of the most exciting parts of my job. From collaborating with my team on fresh designs to developing best-in-class fabrics, I love creating gear that inspires more women to get outside. But this year, instead of dreaming up adventure wear, I’m tangled in a nightmare of tariff hikes and policy uncertainty — wondering how my small business will survive.
I’m the founder and CEO of Wild Rye, a small, Idaho-based outdoor apparel brand that specializes in technical gear for women. We’re proudly B Corp certified, one of Idaho’s fastest-growing companies, and passionate about fueling adventure in the mountains, rivers, and wild places that define this state. But right now, the greatest threat to my business isn’t a competitor or even inflation. It’s U.S. trade policy.
Trump floats high tariffs on Japan, Korea and more countries by Aug. 1

Here in Idaho, the outdoor recreation industry generates over $4 billion in economic impact and supports more than 37,000 jobs. Tourists and locals alike are flocking to the outdoors in record numbers, and small businesses like mine are essential to that growth. But thanks to a volatile and punitive tariff regime, we’re being pushed to the brink.
Let me put it plainly: We’re facing up to $1.2 million in tariffs on a $700,000 order for our upcoming Fall/Winter line — up from the $200,000 we budgeted. The uncertainty of where these tariff rates will land are paralyzing, and could even eclipse the cost of the product itself. But here’s the kicker: Wild Rye is thriving. Our business is one of the fastest growing in the outdoor industry and in Idaho. But this tariff burden is a death sentence — because we’re succeeding in an economy rigged against small businesses.
In our nine-year history, we’ve weathered a lot: COVID, inflation, supply chain breakdowns. We’ve always adapted and come back stronger. But these tariffs are different, forcing us to freeze salary increases, halt all hiring, stop discretionary spending, raise prices, and drastically lower our sales forecast. We even opened up ownership opportunities to our community via Wefunder to keep moving forward.
Personally, my house is on the line. The debt we’re taking on to cover tariffs will be nearly impossible to pay off under these new conditions. I’ve put everything I have into this company because I believe in Wild Rye, and I believe in the future of Idaho’s outdoor economy. But right now, that future is being undermined by federal policies that are out of touch with the realities on the ground.
Here’s what’s most frustrating: we had a functioning trade system. Small businesses could thrive. But now, we’re saddled with tariffs that punish small manufacturers without achieving their intended goal. The promise to bring apparel manufacturing back to the U.S. simply isn’t being fulfilled. I tried to build a Made-in-the-USA brand when I started Wild Rye in 2016. But a broken domestic supply chain — flawed manufacturing, repeated delays, sky-high costs, and no accountability — nearly ended the business before it began.
I still believe that more U.S. manufacturing is possible. But the answer is not to punish small businesses who have no viable domestic alternatives. The only players who can absorb these costs are multinational corporations, while small business — the true engine of the outdoor economy — are being taxed into extinction.
The outdoor industry supports 5 million jobs nationwide and small businesses like mine are its backbone. Our stories must be included in trade policy decisions.
Idaho’s outdoor economy depends on pragmatic, pro-business leadership. I want to thank U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, for their past support of small businesses like mine, and I urge them — along with the Trump administration — to take action now.
My ask is simple: Stand up for Idaho’s outdoor economy. Fix this broken tariff system. Restore the exclusion process. Create a pathway to domestic manufacturing before forcing small businesses to depend on a supply chain that doesn’t exist. Our livelihoods depend on it.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate) Arkansas students improved slightly in statewide test scores compared to last year, according to data released Thursday. 
The 2024-2025 academic year marks just the second time students have taken a new annual exam developed by state education officials called the Arkansas Teaching, Learning and Assessment System, or ATLAS. 
Presenting the data to the state’s education board Thursday, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said he was pleased to have the data so quickly because it will allow teachers to make data-based decisions as they prepare for the upcoming school year. Last year, the data wasn’t released until October.
According to the new data, roughly 35% of all 3rd- through 12th-grade students tested proficient or above in English language arts and math, and 38% achieved those levels in science. Overall, students saw an increase from last year’s score of 0.8%, 2.7%, 2.4% in each category, respectively. 
Some of the biggest improvements were seen in end-of-course exams for algebra, geometry and biology. Students scoring proficient or above in geometry increased from 18% to 21.5%, year over year. Algebra I and biology scores increased from 26.8% to 30.8%, and from 36.4% to 37.7%, respectively.
“You can still see there is a lot of work to do in our end-of-course exams and a lot of work to do overall in the state, but moving the trendline in the right direction shows slow and steady progress,” Oliva said.
Offering end-of-course exams is a change from the test previously used by the state, a summative exam called ACT Aspire. A summative assessment measures how much a student has learned at the end of the academic year by comparing it to a benchmark or standard.
Arkansas education board approves performance levels for new student assessment

ADE developed ATLAS in 2023 to replace ACT Aspire, which was discontinued. State lawmakers in 2023 approved a $71.4 million contract with Cambium Assessment, a company based in Washington, D.C., to develop the new test.
Unlike ACT Aspire, which was an off-the-shelf product, education officials crafted an Arkansas-specific exam by pulling items from Cambium’s question bank and creating new questions to meet state standards. Teachers also have the ability to pull questions from the bank to craft their own assessments and measure progress throughout the year. 
While ACT Aspire was a predictor of career and college readiness, ATLAS allows students to be measured against the state standards they’re expected to learn, Oliva said. Asked by board members about comparing scores, Oliva said it’s difficult to do because they measure different things. 
When Oliva arrived in Arkansas in 2023, he said ACT Aspire scores were showing improvement, but the state was still below pre-pandemic levels. To continue making gains, Oliva said it’s important to keep pushing forward with provisions of the LEARNS Act, a wide-ranging 2023 law that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system. 
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders agreed, saying in a press release Thursday that this year’s ATLAS results demonstrate her signature education law is working.
“By making the largest investment ever in our public schools, implementing literacy standards and support, raising starting teacher pay, and rewarding our best educators, we are creating an environment where Arkansas’ students are set up to succeed in the classroom — and thrive once they graduate,” Sanders said. 
At Thursday’s State Board of Education meeting, Oliva also touted a new law called Arkansas ACCESS which, among other things, increases students’ access to accelerated courses. 
“We can love our students to mediocrity, but that’s not our goal,” Oliva said. “We have to push them to excellence, and that is what we’re going to continue to do in this data and in this school year.”
On the topic of pushing students, board member Jeff Wood asked if at the August meeting they could discuss moving the statewide testing window from April to May to help make days at the end of the academic year “more meaningful.” 
Oliva said he’d be “happy to.”
ATLAS results are available here.

Or the time the beer on St. Patrick’s Day turned an unexpected green, and then, when the next beer was drawn, wasn’t green but a golden amber. (An ornery Irish ghost named “Jack” took the blame.)
Or the time the proprietor fashioned up an engagement ring — using some wire and a crystal from a chandelier — so a local man could propose to his long-time girlfriend.
Jeanne Goetzinger, who’s operated the Inn and its 77 Longbranch Saloon, for 35 years, says she’s going to miss the stories and the characters she’s welcomed at the 135-year-old, brick structure. Those characters range from talk show host Dick Cavett, Olympic gold medalist Billy Mills and former presidential candidate George McGovern, to a well-known, Chadron street person named Matthew Red Shirt.
But Goetzinger, now 78, said it’s time to turn over the colorful and historic place to someone else.
“I don’t have the energy and capacity to be able to have it open as much as I’d like it to be,” she said. “It’s only fair to the community to offer it for sale, so it could become the lively place it used to be.”
How lively?
Mini-skirts, live bands
Goetzinger used to station two Chadron State College coeds, dressed in skin-tight, mini-skirts and holding “turn here” signs, along U.S. Highway 385, to beckon motorcyclists heading to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, to stay at the Olde Main and enjoy a beer garden and a live band.
On Wednesday nights, she organized a weekly social club that drew an eclectic crowd that included local college professors, a former NASA rocket scientist, a local author and a former Nashville session musician.
The saloon was also a late-night gathering spot for members of the Mari Sandoz Heritage Society and the late Ron Hull, a long-time public television personality, as well as the jumping off point for members of the John Neihardt Foundation headed north for an annual hike up Black Elk Peak.

Goetzinger, whose abundant locks of curly, red hair have turned grey in recent years, said she doesn’t want to leave the place and its colorful clientele, but it’s just time.
“I never know what the adventure of the day is going to be,” she said. “It’s been fun. I’m going to miss the thousands of stories.”
So the nine-suite inn, with a restaurant, a bar, a cozy corner out-building and living quarters for the proprietor, is up for sale. The asking price is $575,000 for a structure on the National Register of Historic Places that, over the decades, played a role in the aftermath of the massacre at Wounded Knee and the history of the nearby “Cowboy Trail” railroad line.
The Inn was originally called the “Hotel Chadron,” and was built by a mischievous Irishman named Jack O’Hanlon (thus the name of the ghost).
Over the years, it served as a YMCA for railroad crews and as the first gymnasium for the fledgling Chadron State College.
The Inn’s rooms are named after prominent local figures such as Sandoz, whose books include “Old Jules” and “Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas,” and Gen. Nelson Miles, whose probe into the killing of nearly 250 Lakotas at Wounded Knee in 1890 concluded that it was “the most abominable, criminal military blunder and a horrible massacre of women and children.”
The ambiance of the saloon is part cowboy, part biker and part sassy. There’s huge elk and deer mounts; a picture of the proprietor astride her 1968 Harley-Davidson motorcycle; and a sign that warns guests about “arguin” with a woman.
“My mind’s made up. Don’t confuse me with the facts,” reads another sign.
Law firm to saloon
Goetzinger left a position as a legal assistant at a prestigious Denver law firm to take over the place from her mother — a former Rosie the Riveter at the Martin Bomber Plant in Omaha. She learned the job of running a hotel and restaurant on the run, but has pared back the operation in recent years.
  Saloon ambiance is part cowboy, part biker and part sassy. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
The Inn’s restaurant, which served prime rib, buffalo burgers and grilled salmon, closed 15 years ago due to a lack of help. The saloon, once open seven days a week, is now open only on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights. And the bed-and-breakfast doesn’t always take walk-ins, even if it’s a Hollywood actor.
The Wednesday night social club, dubbed the “Algonquin Round Table” after a legendary New York City gathering of artists and writers, fell apart during the pandemic, in part due to spats over wearing masks to protect Goetzinger’s medically fragile son from the virus.
She said she hopes someone would reopen the restaurant and revive the saloon that used to be filled with college students, professors and local cowboys, but knows those decisions would be for a new owner.
“I would prefer someone who was sensitive to the history of the building and all that goes with it,” Goetzinger said.
Tradition continues?
The summer tourist season — an industry with an estimated $30 million impact in the region — has now begun in Chadron, a community of 5,100 that hugs the shoulders of the Pine Ridge, a rocky outcropping of the nearby Black Hills of South Dakota, which is about an hour’s drive away.
Some bikers have already called to book rooms for the Sturgis Rally, and the Inn has regulars in the fall for deer and turkey hunts on the Pine Ridge. A new hike-bike trail is being developed on the old Cowboy Line just outside the door, which may bring a new breed of “bikers.”
Goetzinger said she’s had some inquiries, but no offers yet. She’s hopeful the “right person” comes along to continue the tradition of the place, and the tales it has spun.
“If the right person walks in and continues a benevolent way of operating the business, they will have one helluva of a great life,” she said. “You may not have a lot of money, but you’ll have a great life.”

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s signature legislation to extend and expand tax cuts in exchange for cuts to Medicaid, Affordable Care Act health coverage and SNAP benefits will have a profound impact on Tennessee, according to estimates by multiple policy groups.
Trump signed the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” into law on July 4. The tax cuts will take effect almost immediately, while the full impact of cuts to social safety net programs will be phased in over the next several years.
Funding cuts to Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would primarily come from new work requirements for adults. This bureaucratic maneuver would impose additional paperwork requirements that advocates expect will disqualify recipients who are unable to complete them.


KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, estimates that changes to funding of the Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance as part of Trump’s legislation will result in around 2% of Tennesseans, or 68,000 people, losing access to their federally subsidized insurance. This matches a similar estimate made by the U.S. House Democrats’ Joint Economic Committee, which predicts even more dire consequences of 170,000 losing coverage.
But for Medicaid, Tennessee will see fewer cuts to its version of the program, called TennCare. Tennessee is one of 10 states that didn’t expand the program to provide insurance to more people living on near-poverty-line wages. 
Nearly 300,000 more Tennesseeans would have had access to Medicaid if the lawmakers had expanded the coverage allowed under the Affordable Care Act, according to the Tennessee Justice Center. The results of having fewer people covered mean fewer will lose coverage. 
Tennesseans will lose approximately 20% of their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. In 2022, nearly 700,000 Tennesseans received around $1.4 billion in SNAP funds, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. About half of those in Tennessee who qualify for the federal assistance are children.


Tennesseans could receive around $7 billion in income tax cuts in 2026 as part of Trump’s legislation, according to an analysis compiled by The Lookout using U.S. Census household income data and estimates from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.
In dollar terms, most of the tax cuts will benefit the wealthiest households in Tennessee.


Who voted for the bill
All eight of Tennessee’s Republican House members voted in favor of the legislation, as did both of the state’s GOP U.S. Senators.
“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act prevents the largest tax hike in American history and secures the largest tax cut ever for individuals and families who endured four years of crushing inflation and reckless spending,” said Tennessee U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn in a statement.
The only member of the Tennessee delegation to oppose the legislation was Memphis Democratic U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen.
“The GOP’s One Big Ugly Bill fails every basic moral test,” said Cohen in a statement. “They are taking food and health care away from poor people so that the wealthiest individuals who have ever lived can become even wealthier.”

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Nebraska Examiner)President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

(Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
The Tennessee law “prohibits health care providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”

– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor



The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

It’s also a cautionary tale about the consequences of a Democratic leadership style that cedes power and demobilizes the public in the face of an increasingly authoritarian opponent.

During the budget process, Wisconsin Democrats had more leverage than they have had since the 2000s, holding the governorship and, due to fairer maps and GOP divisions, the deciding votes in the state Senate. Combined with an unusual state budget surplus made possible by Biden-era policies, and the striking unpopularity of the GOP’s budget stands on the big issues, this was a golden opportunity to start to undo the damage wrought by Republicans during the administration of former Gov. Scott Walker. This budget could have begun to reverse Wisconsin’s long term disinvestment in public education and local government services, expand BadgerCare, start to address the affordability crisis in child care, housing, home energy, and health care, and build a buffer against a coming tsunami of slashing cuts from President Donald Trump’s Big Ugly Bill.
But rather than marshalling all the power at his disposal to achieve progress on at least some of these objectives, the Governor gave away his leverage by not bringing Senate Democrats into negotiations until the very end, and then signing off on a concessionary bargain without a public fight, even whipping Democratic votes to support the disappointing deal. 
Despite improved leverage, Evers followed the script of his first three budgets. In 2019, facing a gerrymandered supermajority, Evers appeared to have a fighting spirit. I was there with dozens of Citizen Action members when he seemed to throw down the gauntlet, memorably declaring days after Republicans removed BadgerCare Expansion from the budget: “I’m going to fight like hell.” Democratic legislators and advocacy groups were blindsided when he suddenly backed down.
The governor and his team are spinning the latest deal as the kind of bipartisan compromise necessary under divided rule in a purple state, hoping that voters will not read the fine print. Republicans were right to brag during the floor debate that the one-sided deal was much closer to their priorities than the ultra moderate blueprint Evers proposed. 










Evers also rewards his opposition for the damage they are willing to inflict on the body politic, wrapping appeasement in the tinsel of a mythic bipartisanship which borders on delusional in the face of an increasingly authoritarian GOP.

The budget lowlights include the first $0 increase in general school aid in decades. (after inflation, that amounts to a real dollar cut in state support for public schools contrasted with yet another large increase for unaccountable voucher schools); a cut in support for child care in the midst of an affordability and access crisis; a $0 increase for mass transit at a time the state’s largest transit system is facing service cuts; and $1.5 billion on regressive tax giveaway which, according to a Kids Forward analysis of the original legislation, funnels nearly 60% of the benefit to the wealthiest households, and a miniscule proportion to Black and Latino families. It contains a huge giveaway to the hospital industry, the Capitol’s most powerful lobby, with no requirements to reduce cost and increase access for patients, or keep facilities open in underserved areas, while missing yet another opportunity to expand BadgerCare in the last year Wisconsin can secure the full financial benefit of 95% federal funding.
After Evers’ second budget surrender in 2021, I wrote a column for the Wisconsin Examiner arguing that hand-wringing over the leadership of establishment Democrats like Evers is counterproductive because it deflects responsibilities away from grassroots progressives for not building enough power to force their hand. As Shakespeare put it in Julius Caesar, “The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

This year, the reaction from the organized grassroots was dramatically different. For the first time organizing groups and education unions, representing tens of thousands of Wisconsinites, publicly campaigned for the governor to fight by wielding his potent veto power and appealing over the heads of the Legislature to the public. As Ruth Conniff reported for the Wisconsin Examiner, at a joint lobby day in late May a raucous crowd filled the hallway at the State Capitol leading to the governor’s office to deliver a letter demanding that he veto any budget that did not meet minimum standards on education, health care, child care and criminal justice. In the weeks leading up to the deal, grassroots leaders kept the pressure on. 
The governor’s concessionary bargain also divided his own party. Dozens of rank and file Democrats at the party convention wore stickers urging Evers to veto a bad budget. A striking number of progressive state legislators spoke out against the budget deal, and despite the administration using the power and resources of the governor’s office to whip votes, 80% of Democratic legislators rejected a budget Evers touts as a victory.
The reaction against Evers’ refusal to fight is parallel to the growing frustration with the failure of national Democratic leaders to adjust their leadership to the authoritarian situation. The critique of establishment Democrats focuses on two dimensions: their willingness to cede power to authoritarians, and their lack of appreciation of the increasingly important role of mass public organization and mobilization as traditional inside levers of power lose their effectiveness. 
The Republicans began shredding the 20th century governing norms well before the rise of Trump. The national GOP has steadily devolved from the conservatism of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to the Newt Gingrich insurgency, the Tea Party, Mitch McConnell’s power grabs during the administration of President Barack  Obama, and finally MAGA, into an authoritarian populist movement seeking to totalize its grip on power by erasing what remains of the checks and balances of the liberal constitutional order.
Wisconsin’s GOP has followed a parallel path towards authoritarianism, including voter suppression laws targeting Democratic constituencies, the scuttling of settled law by a former Republican-backed majority on the Wisconsin  Supreme Court to legally sanitize Walker’s gross violations of campaign finance laws, a lame duck session stripping Evers of powers, and the unprecedented refusal to confirm the governor’s appointments to cabinet positions and state boards so they can be fired at will by the Legislature. Wisconsin did not meet the accepted political science definitions of democracy in its lawmaking branch of government from 2012-2024 because of a partisan gerrymander so severe that, as in Viktor Orbán’s Hungry, one party was guaranteed victory. 
In the face of the  onslaught in the second Trump administration, establishment Democrats at the national level are violating historian Timothy Snyder’s well-known first lesson in fighting authoritarianism: Do not freely cede power by obeying in advance. Emblematic was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s decision to supply the votes needed to keep the government open. Schumer ratified many of Trump’s illegal cancellations of programs without the consent of Congress, arguing that in a shutdown he would have even more power to ransack federal agencies. In effect, Trump and his allies took the government hostage, reaping the rewards of their own lawlessness. 
Evers also rewards his opposition for the damage they are willing to inflict on the body politic, wrapping appeasement in the tinsel of a mythic bipartisanship which borders on delusional in the face of an increasingly authoritarian GOP. Evers has long argued that using his power to veto a bad budget, or force an impasse to mobilize public opposition, would empower Republicans to do worse damage by “going back to base.” The “base,” in Wisconsin budget-ese, is the last state budget, which would, factoring inflation, constitute a massive cut in all state programs. By Evers’ logic, a bad deal is better than no deal.

The second lesson in an authoritarian situation violated by the likes of Schumer and Evers is the necessity of empowering mass mobilization. There is an overwhelming consensus among democracy scholars that resistance to authoritarians requires the large-scale and sustained marshalling of the power of the public. An impressive body of political science research documents that large scale peaceful nonviolent resistance movements are the most effective vehicles for overturning authoritarian regimes.
This populist orientation is not entirely new. In the early 20th century Wisconsin’s progressive Gov. Fighting Bob La Follette and Progressive Era presidents mobilized the public to break the stranglehold of the Robber Barons of the Gilded Age, winning the power to enact major reform.
The lesson also applies to the liminal status of the U.S., somewhere between healthy democracy and autocracy, where traditional levers of power are losing their effectiveness, and large-scale popular resistance is an essential power to slow and ultimately reverse the authoritarian advance.
In this light, the problem with Evers’ approach to governing is that by making it entirely an inside game of bargaining with the Legislature, he freely gives away power, cutting out civil society groups that want to mobilize on behalf of his agenda and denying the public clear rallying points for exerting pressure on the process. This leadership style also erodes democracy by failing to deliver for average people, building an audience for authoritarian scapegoating of marginalized people and fake solutions.
If Evers had established a clear bottom line in the budget process on popular issues like public education and health care, and used both his veto power and the need for Democratic votes in the Senate to block a budget that did not include them, then he would have been in a position to work with grassroots groups and use his bully pulpit to rally public opinion against his opponents ahead of an election where control of the Legislature is in play, exerting tremendous pressure. Instead the public is left with no clear understanding of why they still can’t afford health care and child care, and why more schools are closing or cutting vital academic programs, as property taxes skyrocket to pay for less and less.
Despite these catastrophic failures in leadership, the future of multiracial democracy does not depend on Evers or other Democrats. It depends on  us. Political parties and social movements make leaders, not the other way around. Grassroots organizing groups and education unions made progress this budget cycle, but we need more people to join and commit, and greater investments in organizing, to win a more progressive Wisconsin. The national resistance to Trump, as measured by the number of people coming to rallies, is gaining steam, but that does not mean we are winning. The history of mass resistance shows that large scale mobilizations lose momentum over time unless enough people actively participate in permanent community-rooted organizing groups that demand bold and transformational leadership. The beating heart of democracy is direct personal engagement in cause-driven voluntary groups. In the end, it’s up to all of us.

As West Virginia records the largest reduction in fatal overdoses across the nation over a 12 month period, substance use disorder experts are urging caution and encouraging the state to continue, while also increasing, the services available to people who use drugs.
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, West Virginia has seen two months of declines in the annual rate of fatal overdoses, representing a 41% decrease compared to deaths reported in both preceding 12 month periods.
The drop is decidedly good news for the state, which has for years been referred to as “ground zero” for the nation’s ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
But even while celebrating, experts say it’s important to ensure the context and circumstances surrounding the decline is taken into account.
“Two months is not a lot of time,” said Michael Meit, director of the Center for Rural Health and Research at East Tennessee State University. “You need to make sure that trend continues and, if it does — which we all hope it will — that’s when you’ll know that the systems in place are working in a positive way.”
The data from the CDC represents overdose deaths recorded between January 2024 and January 2025, the most recent data available for analysis by the agency. The numbers are provisional and could increase as more deaths are analyzed.
According to the data, West Virginia so far has confirmed 787 deaths in that 12 month period. Between January 2023 and 2024, per the data, the state saw 1,351 residents die from overdoses.
Meit, who is also an associate professor in ETSU’s Department of Health Services Management and Policy, said there are several factors that could contribute to the state successfully curbing fatal overdose rates. Crucial context for the decline, he said, is how rates of both substance use and fatal overdoses related to that use increased so much during the pandemic.
In 2020, 1,343 West Virginians died from fatal overdoses — setting a new record for the state. In 2021, deaths increased again to 1,537, according to data from the state health department. The trend in the state reflected what was happening nationally; overdoses — fatal and otherwise — increased nearly everywhere while the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded.
In 2022, 2023 and 2024, overdose deaths in West Virginia dropped consecutively each year, per the data.  
Now, Meit said, it’s likely conditions are evening out. The record decline could, at least in part, reflect this.










“Two months is not a lot of time. You need to make sure that trend continues and, if it does — which we all hope it will — that’s when you’ll know that the systems in place are working in a positive way.”


– Michael Meit, director of the Center for Rural Health and Research at East Tennessee State University 


“I hope we’re turning a curve, but I’m a little bit of a skeptic at heart. West Virginia leading the nation [in the decline] implies that West Virginia is doing better than other places in addressing these issues. So I do think that it’s not just a blip, but there are other things to consider,” Meit said. “I am concerned that a lot of the declining overdose rates that we are seeing now — a partial factor is what we call a return to baseline. So we are essentially getting back to where we were pre-pandemic.”
The fatalities reported between January 2024 and 2025 are the lowest recorded in the state since 2015, when 735 people died from overdoses. At the time, that was the highest number reported by West Virginia in one year since 2001, when the state started tracking and reporting overdose deaths.
Dr. James Berry, who serves as chair for the Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry at West Virginia University’s Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, said he was “encouraged” to see declines in the state. But like Meit, he’s cautious about assuming the declines will continue without further work, especially given where West Virginia still stands nationally.
“This decline means so many more lives will continue to exist because of efforts that have been going on in the state. At the same time, in West Virginia, we still lead the nation by far in the rates of overdose deaths,” Berry said. “We’ve had a wonderful decline, but still I don’t think people appreciate how far above we are other states [in the rate of fatal overdoses], above the national average. So we still have a very, very long way to go.”
‘We have to keep our foot on the pedal’ 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated the state’s decline in overdose deaths during a news conference in Princeton on Wednesday. In a release after, he said the state is “setting the standard for successfully battling addiction and saving lives.”
“Our nation-leading reduction in overdose deaths is the result of a holistic approach to tackle drug use and abuse,” Morrisey said. “We will continue to work hard together to prevent further senseless death in West Virginia.”
Meit has spent a lot of time researching what factors and policies, specifically, lead communities to decreasing or increasing their overdose rates.
One of his studies honed in on eastern Kentucky, a region both culturally and economically reminiscent of West Virginia’s southern coalfields.
West Virginia’s coalfield counties continuously lead the state — as well as the nation — in the rate of fatal overdoses. Not long ago, the counties in eastern Kentucky did the same.
But something happened in the 2010s that turned the tide in Kentucky.
Between 2012 and 2017, eight of the top 10 counties in the nation with the steepest decrease in overdose mortality were clustered in eastern Kentucky.
“What we found was a big investment in addressing the substance use crisis — in establishing harm reduction programs throughout the state, making sure they had treatment beds available, paying for treatment, engaging their criminal justice system,” Meit said. “These declines were studied over a 10 year period before the pandemic; we know it wasn’t just a blip — it was a direct response to the systems in place.”
Kentucky today, Meit said, has the most harm reduction sites of any state in the country. Most offer syringe service programs. The state also has the highest number of residential treatment beds and its Medicaid program includes a dedicated benefit for receiving substance use disorder treatment.
The environment in West Virginia, however, is much different.
Harm reduction programs are few and far between. Needs-based syringe service programs — which are the most effective at preventing disease among people who use drugs as well as transitioning people into recovery — are banned at the state level. There’s a shortage of treatment beds, especially in the regions hardest hit by the drug epidemic. There’s been a moratorium on establishing new methadone clinics in the state for years, meaning the medication — proven to be incredibly effective at helping people overcome opioid use disorder — isn’t available to most.
The current recovery and rehabilitation environment in West Virginia can largely be attributed to policies adopted by the state Legislature over the last decade. In the last several years, very few laws have been enacted by the body that reflect “best practices” for addiction and recovery; instead lawmakers have mostly focused on the criminalization of substance use disorder and the people who live with it.
Berry has worked in West Virginia studying and treating substance use disorder since 2002. He’s watched firsthand as the nature of the epidemic has shifted from prescription drug use to heroin use to, most recently, fentanyl. Each time, as new drugs have come into communities, overdoses have increased alongside increased use.
Berry has also watched how policies have evolved — or, in several ways, devolved — in response to the changes in the nature of the epidemic. 
It’s likely, Berry said, that the decreases being celebrated this month in West Virginia reflect “the bearing of fruit that were the labors put in place, five to 10 years ago.”
Those “labors” include expanded access to naloxone, efforts to destigmatize addiction, recruiting health care workers with specific expertise on substance use disorder, increasing access to treatment programs as well as beds and an emphasis on educating both the public and providers about the disease.
Berry is slightly concerned that the successes being celebrated this month could mean a decreased focus by lawmakers on interventions that are working. To step back now, he said, would threaten future success.
“It’s so encouraging that we’ve got some traction. After so many years of going in the wrong direction, we finally have some traction but we have to keep our foot on the pedal and keep going forward,” Berry said. “If we don’t do that, if we don’t keep looking at what more we can do, then I really fear that we’re going to start getting worse again.”

(Scott Olson | Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

There was a time in this fair state when the rivers ran gin clear over shining freestone beds, when you could cast a fly and have large cutthroat, rainbow, brown or brook trout readily rise.  In some places, you could even find the now nearly-extinct Fluvial Arctic Grayling. 
But now the rivers are so low and hot the struggle is just to keep the fish alive, let alone deal with the neon green algae now coating those freestone beds on every major river.
How did we get here?  
Well, more than 50 years ago the Montana Power Company announced the construction of its coal-fired generation plants at Colstrip.  Despite considerable opposition by nearby residents, farmers, ranchers, and many, many others, Montana Power brazenly claimed Colstrip would be “the boiler room for the nation.” 
Now, thanks to the continuing operation of arguably the nation’s dirtiest coal-fired power plants, the planet, the nation — and Montana’s world-famous rivers and streams — are indeed boiling. 
The evidence is undeniable that continuing to burn coal and spew endless tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has and continues to create our global climate crisis.  Yet, for some bizarre reason Montana’s governor and congressional delegation — as well as most of their GOP colleagues in Congress and the Legislature — refuse to acknowledge that truth.
The result is equally undeniable: The mounting problems being faced by farmers and ranchers as well as rivers, forests, fish, wildlife and the public are directly connected to the continuing use of fossil fuels — among which coal leads the pack for atmospheric greenhouse gas pollution.
While our science-deprived president blathers about “beautiful clean coal” the fact is, that’s just another in his tens of thousands of lies.  There is no clean coal.  None. 
If Montana’s congressional delegation and governor want to run around in red MAGA hats and kowtow to the president’s fictions about clean coal, I’m sure no one would much care — if only the rest of us didn’t have to pay the ever-growing price for their foolish political charade.  And make no mistake, we are paying that price every day in every way. 
The temperatures surpassed 90 degrees in Montana in May.  May, not August.  Normally the mountains would still be covered in their winter white in May.  And June, traditionally our wettest month, would begin to melt that snowpack and provide the clear, rushing runoff flows that scour our riverbeds to keep them healthy for our once-famed and ever-more-rare functioning coldwater aquatic ecosystems. 
But once again, as the successive drought years stack up, we have extremely high temperatures and extremely low flows in our rivers and streams, miles-long algae blooms and temperatures that are lethal for our coldwater fisheries.  In the meantime, as our forests bake and burn our populace swelters in a state where air conditioning was once considered unnecessary.  
So here’s the challenge to Gov. Greg Gianforte, Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy:  Tell us how burning more coal, which you all support, is going to get us out of this mess.  
Tell us how more coal pollution is going to lower the temperatures, provide more snowpack, give us back our longer winters, springs, and falls instead of the inferno to which you have damned us.   
I can assure you, your fellow Montanans are waiting to hear how burning more coal is going to stop the raging climate crisis that is killing our rivers, streams, fish, wildlife, forests and crops.  
We want our “old Montana” northern-tier climate again, not some MAGA fever dream.

The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”










The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case..


– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
 Sex-based protections

The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
 
Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
 ‘Scientific and policy debates’

Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

(Getty Images)As homelessness rises in Kentucky, especially outside the two largest cities, the Trump administration wants to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in federal support for state housing programs.
Recently released data showing an increase in Kentuckians experiencing homelessness comes from the annual “Point-In-Time” count conducted each January to capture a snapshot of homelessness across the country. The Kentucky Housing Corporation, a quasi-governmental agency that manages federal funding for housing, publishes the numbers.
In January 2025, volunteers and agency outreach workers counted 5,789 individuals who lacked “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence,” the federal definition of homeless used for the survey. That was a 10.7% increase from January 2024.
The most significant percentage increases in homelessness were outside the state’s two largest cities. Louisville and Jefferson County saw an increase of 6%, Lexington and Fayette County saw an increase of 12%. The increase in the other 118 counties was 13.3%.
Shaye Rabold, a technical administrator for the Kentucky Housing Corporation who helped coordinate the January count, told the Lantern the rise in homelessness was unfortunately “not surprising.” 
She said calls from people needing assistance statewide continue to increase, driven by people who became homeless less than a year ago. It’s the fourth year in a row the count has risen in Kentucky. 
A main reason for the rise, Rabold said, is the state’s ongoing housing shortage, especially the lack of low-income rentals.
“It’s a problem nationally, but we know it’s a problem in Kentucky. And so when you have people that literally have nowhere else to go — they’re pushed out of the market, or they don’t have family support that they can lean on, whatever the case might be — it’s going to lead to increases in homelessness,” Rabold said. 

The survey also counts people who meet the federal definition of unsheltered homeless because they are sleeping in cars, the wilderness, abandoned buildings and similar settings. 
The largest percentage increase in unsheltered homelessness from 2024 to 2025 — 25% — also was outside Lexington and Louisville. 
Adrienne Bush, the executive director of the advocacy group Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said the picture some people have of homelessness is “someone on a pretty busy street in a city in a tent.” 
“The picture is more nuanced and fuller than just that mental image,” Bush said, referencing the significant rise in rural homelessness reflected in the data. “The federal assistance that we do have in place is working to house people as quickly as possible, but the larger housing market conditions are creating these additional pressures.”
Undercount?
Critics say the annual nationwide “Point-In-Time” effort is an undercount, pointing to how the count is conducted on only a single day in January when people experiencing homelessness are more likely to find temporary shelter indoors. Both Rabold and Bush said while the count is not perfect, it serves as a solid estimate that shows the general trend of homelessness in Kentucky.
The vast majority of counties and rural communities in the state do not have emergency shelters, which often means there is “nowhere else for people to go but to sleep outside,” Rabold said.
Rabold also said the increased numbers outside Louisville and Lexington could be partially attributed to having additional resources for “street outreach” in rural areas — something the housing corporation has been able to provide thanks to earlier increases in federal funding — a trend that could sharply reverse under the Trump administration. 
Proposed federal housing funding cuts
Kentucky could lose about $286 million in federal housing funding — out of about $651 million in current funding — under a proposed 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) budget proposed by the Trump administration. That’s according to data from the Urban Institute provided to the Lantern by the Kentucky Housing Corp.
While most proposed funding cuts would come from federal rental assistance programs, the cuts also would impact HUD funding for homelessness assistance and affordable housing construction. The remaining federal funding for rental assistance would be allocated to states “to design their own rental assistance initiatives based on their unique needs and preferences,” according to a proposed 2026 fiscal year budget outline by the Trump administration.
The budget proposals are recommendations from the executive branch and could be changed as Congress crafts and approves a federal budget. In a visit to Arkansas earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner said the agency’s ultimate goal was to “get people off subsidies and live a life of self-sustainability.”
Kentucky Housing Corp. officials have spoken out against the significant budget cuts.
Wendy Smith, the deputy executive director of housing programs, told a Kentucky Public Radio reporter that while the state housing corporation would like to “streamline” the “Section 8” voucher program, the budget proposal was a “radical cut” that would be “disruptive at so many levels across Kentucky.”
Smith told state lawmakers in late June there was a need to boost housing supply across all income brackets. She said the impacts of a constrained housing supply were multifold, including a rise in homelessness.
“We have higher average housing costs right now. Kentuckians are spending too much of their monthly income on housing costs. We have lower home ownership rates, too little workforce housing, increased household instability as evidenced by evictions and then more homeless Kentuckians,” Smith said. “The federal budget uncertainty makes a big question mark on a lot of this.” 
Rabold disputed assertions that the continued rise of homelessness in Kentucky is evidence that federal housing funding has been ineffective. Federally funded programs designed to help homeless people find housing and other supportive services are very effective, she said. What the funding is not designed to do, she said, is prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place. 
“That is more of a housing supply issue than anything,” Rabold said. “I use the metaphor of like a bathtub with a faucet on, and you’re bailing water out — but the faucet keeps running.”

The mission to enrich lives and build stronger communities by informing, inspiring and connecting remains the cornerstone of this Kentucky institution.
On June 12, the House of Representatives passed the Rescissions Act of 2025, which would eliminate all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, reversing funding already appropriated by Congress. Under a July 18 deadline, the Senate is now considering the proposal.  
However, the impact of the Rescissions Act isn’t about Washington, D.C. or even KET.  
It’s about the loss of programs and services that more than 2 million people depend on each week, including parents, students, teachers, first responders and others.

For KET, the annual CPB grant is essential and part of what has traditionally been an effective and efficient funding mix. If that were to go away, the impact on KET — and those we serve — would be enormous.
Generations of Kentuckians know KET by our positive and trusted early childhood programs such as “Sesame Street,” “Daniel Tiger” and many more designed to help develop vocabulary and math skills and prepare children for school and life. For some it’s their only early learning provider.  
Teachers and families count on KET’s high-quality educational resources available free of charge and serving K-12 and beyond.  
People from one end of Kentucky to the other depend on KET as their source for in-depth information about our state, from all the wonderful aspects worth celebrating to the challenges we must face together. 
Providing live, unfiltered coverage of the Kentucky General Assembly and Kentucky Supreme Court serves to keep an informed and connected citizenry.  
And KET helps keep Kentuckians safe. Through our 15-tower network, KET provides a reliable infrastructure for public safety emergency communications and warnings about severe weather, tornadoes, flooding and other emergencies. 
The loss of federal funding (about 96 cents per person) would dramatically change KET’s operations and ability to produce uniquely Kentucky-centric programs and services on which so many depend.  A Kentucky asset, built over decades through the investment and support of Kentuckians, KET is a treasure that needs your support.

Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 The role of agriculture

As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion.
But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 Citizen action

The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.














I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade



“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 Small towns struggle

Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

Lawyers for civil rights groups and voters told a panel of three judges that they’d proven their points, while a lawyer for Republican legislators argued that election lines were drawn for partisan reasons to advantage GOP candidates.  
“It doesn’t make sense they would use race and invite liability when they can use partisanship,” said Katherine McKnight, the Republicans’ lawyer. 
The North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause and a group of Black voters, and a separate group of Black and Latino voters sued in 2023 over redistricting plans drawn that year and used in in the 2024 elections. The two lawsuits were consolidated for the federal trial held in Winston-Salem before a three-judge panel. The claims originally included sets of state House, state Senate, and congressional districts, but claims against the state House districts were dismissed. 
Black voting power diluted in multiple regions
The civil rights groups and voters contend Republican legislators drew districts that dilute the voting power of Black citizens so that they are no longer able to elect candidates of their choice. Republican legislators said they used political data, not racial data, to create the districts.
The state gained a congressional seat after the 2020 census, partly due to the increase in the Black population, said Lali Madduri, a lawyer representing Black and Latino voters. That increase has not translated into more voting power for Black residents, she said. 
Black voters were able to elect candidates of their choice in 6.2 of the state’s 14 congressional districts in 2022, Madduri said, while that dropped to 3.8 districts in the 2023 plan. 
Wednesday’s testimony about congressional districts focused largely on the Piedmont Triad region and Mecklenburg County.

Congressional districts in those areas were redrawn to eliminate seats Democrats could win. 
Voters’ lawyers said Black voters in Guilford County are no longer able to elect the candidate of their choice because they’re distributed among three districts. 
The changes were not the product of partisan gerrymandering, Madduri said. 
She said Black voters were more likely than their white counterparts to be moved out of the previous version of 6th Congressional District, which included all of Guilford County.
Black voters were shifted out of the 2022 version of the 14th Congressional District — which included about half of Mecklenburg County and half of Gaston County — and moved into a Charlotte-centric 12th Congressional District for the 2024 election.
“Evidence supports that race was a factor,” she said. “The 2023 plan is worse than the 2022 plan on every metric.”
Under a court-ordered plan used in 2022, North Carolina elected seven Democrats and seven Republicans to Congress. Under the plans Republicans approved in 2023, 10 Republicans and four Democrats were elected to the U.S. House last year. 
Hilary Harris Klein, a lawyer for the NC NAACP and Common Cause, said the 2023 configuration of the 1st Congressional District in eastern North Carolina also had a disproportionate impact on Black voters and their ability to elect candidates of their choice.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis eked out a win in November. The district has elected a Black representative since 1992, when Eva Clayton became the first Black candidate since 1898 to win a US House seat from North Carolina. 
The redrawn 2023 version of the district is the first since 1992 to exclude Pitt County, Klein said. Parts of Greenville were removed from the district, she said, and majority-white coastal counties were added. 
In the state Senate election map, Republicans divided counties known as the “Black Belt” in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, Klein said. The region now has one Black state senator when there had been two or three. 
Lawyers for GOP cite partisan objectives
McKnight, the Republicans’ lawyer, recounted testimony from Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), who said legislators did not use racial data to create the state Senate or congressional maps, but drew districts that would “perform for Republican candidates.”
Hise was co-chair of the Senate Redistricting Committee. 
Plaintiffs can’t establish that legislators targeted voters based on race, McKnight said, and are left only with circumstantial evidence. 
“A claim based on circumstantial evidence is difficult to prove,” she said. She suggested that the plaintiffs are “dressing up partisan gerrymandering claims in racial garb” because North Carolina courts and federal courts will no longer consider partisan gerrymandering cases. 
Plaintiffs contend that state Senate District 8 is racially gerrymandered because legislators created it by moving largely Black neighborhoods in Wilmington out of the New Hanover district and melding those precincts with two more rural counties. The New Hanover cutout is known as the “Wilmington notch.”
McKnight said Hise testified that the district was drawn based on political considerations. She recounted another witness testifying that the New Hanover notch precincts were those that performed the worst for Republicans. 
In 2022, Republican Sen. Mike Lee of New Hanover won his race for the seat by 1,710 votes. In 2024, he won by 10,264 votes.

Dueling experts
Since Black voters overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, one of the issues the judges considered was whether voters’ race and their political preferences can be disentangled. 
The maps’ challengers turned to Jonathan Rodden, a political scientist and redistricting expert from Stanford University, who used statistical analyses to conclude that even when accounting for party preference, “we see significant effect for race within the contested districts.”
Rodden focused his testimony on congressional districts in the Piedmont Triad and two that include Mecklenburg County. 
Rodden testified on the first day of the trial and on the last day, when he defended his analysis from criticism by Republicans’ experts that his methods didn’t show what he claimed. 
Sean Trende, a redistricting expert and senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, said he did not think a technique Rodden used is a “reliable method for detecting racial gerrymanders.” 
Rodden said he never uses the term “racial gerrymandering.”
“I can’t tell you what people were thinking in drawing these districts,” Rodden said. “I’m just trying to explain that data.”
Judges Thomas Schroeder, Richard Myers II, and Allison Rushing heard the evidence. All three were appointed by Republican presidents.

Hamilton St. in Richmond. The facility is one of 16 abortion clinics across Virginia. (Courtesy of the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood)Federal funding to Planned Parenthood facilities in Virginia and across the nation are tied up in legal battles for the time being. A provision in Congress’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump last week would block Medicaid payments for services at facilities like Planned Parenthood for up to a year. 
Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration over the provision on Monday and a district court judge granted the organization a two-week restraining order against the federal government.
In the commonwealth, about 700 to 800 patients per month use Medicaid to pay for services, said RaeAnn Pickett, communications director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. The organization’s clinics serve around 25,000 patients overall at its facilities around the state, she said. 
The next set of arguments in Planned Parenthood’s case will occur on July 21 and determine  whether a longer pause will be granted. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that some clinics in the country have posted notices on their websites alerting patients they can no longer accept Medicaid in order to comply with the law. 
While the national organization has drawn ire from anti-abortion advocates and many Republicans over the years for ending pregnancies, that is just one of the health care services the group provides. Planned Parenthood clinics around the nation also offer cancer screenings, sexual health testing, contraception and breast exams. 
The most recent data from 2023, Pickett said, shows that Virginia’s centers provided contraception to over 12,000 patients, conducted more than 12,000 sexually transmitted disease tests, performed nearly 1,300 breast exams and performed 705 cervical cancer screenings (which yielded 53 abnormal results, prompting patients to seek follow-up care). 
“Every cancer that goes undetected, every STI that goes untreated, every patient who can’t get birth control or abortion care when they need it — all of it is on their hands,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockart said in a statement as Congress was passing the reconciliation bill. 
Federal law has long prohibited Medicaid coverage from funding abortions, save for specific circumstances. The organization emphasizes that targeting Medicaid funding being used in its facilities will actually affect other components of reproductive health care that low-income families rely on. 
“The Defund Provision is a naked attempt to leverage the government’s spending power to attack and penalize Planned Parenthood and impermissibly single it out for unfavorable treatment,” the organization said in the filing.
Earlier this year, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia were affected by the Trump administration’s freeze on Title X funding — a decades-old federal program that helps extremely low income families access family planning care at little to no cost. That equaled about 11,000 Virginia patients who were subject to higher costs for care. 
In states like Virginia without tight restrictions or bans on abortion, organizations like Planned Parenthood have been a critical access point for travelers seeking abortions. 
Pickett said that close to 30% of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood are from out-of-state patients — meaning that about 3,000 people are traveling for care. Overall abortion providers in Virginia have reported a rise in out-of-state patients in recent years, as surrounding states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure.

(Photo: John Partipilo)In May Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell wrapped up his 2025 State of Metro address with a call for Nashvillians to “give ourselves some more choices about how we move into our future together.” 
Let’s grant off the top that political State of The Whatever speeches inevitably amount to ritually upbeat exercises in civic fantasy with a news making shelf life of about an hour. But parking the cynicism for a few minutes (a heavy lift for me) I found myself chewing on hizzoner’s yen for a promising future as I scanned recent news items on the city’s economic trajectory:

A story chronicling how Nashville over the last decade has parlayed its Music City branding into an unstoppable tourism growth juggernaut that “catapulted us to where we are today,” according to the head of the city’s Chamber of Commerce. 
News that aggressive development of tall gleaming apartment buildings has gifted (some might say saddled) the city center with a large inventory (some might say glut) of unrented tall-gleaming-apartment-building apartments, with vacancies said to number in the thousands.
Word that the design of a new boulevard down the heart of the Cumberland River’s East Bank may turn out to be just another six-lane car-centric pike rather than the multimodal transit dreamscape we were invited to imagine when the East Bank vision thing went down three years ago.
Numbers showing that Nashville’s downtown office vacancy rate well exceeds the national average, with many of the city’s largest non-government buildings losing significant value.
Reporting that the downtown convention center is pondering a massive expansion because, according to Music City Center CEO Charles Starks, “we simply don’t have the space to accommodate every group, and we’re turning away business daily.”

Taken together the picture these and similar dispatches paint is a paradoxical one: a city that manages to be simultaneously vibrant and stagnant. There’s a lot going on, yet it somehow feels like Nashville is  running in place.

To be sure, indicators of economic vim abound: rising population with job growth to match, relentless tourism, low unemployment, new hotels, pricey apartments, added BNA destinations, and let’s not forget expanding options for hot chicken and (finally!) good Italian. It all makes for an impressive array of signals of a certain kind of urban vitality, but these are markers of growth itself, not necessarily development or advancement (except maybe the good Italian part). 
Growth doesn’t automatically make a city a better place, and it certainly doesn’t by itself spark us to “move into the future together.” I’ll admit that’s a pretty pedestrian observation, but apparently not pedestrian enough to penetrate the collective crania of the forces driving economic Nashville. If music is Nashville’s cultural house of worship, growth for the sake of growth is its civic religion, propelled by its lead divine commandment: more is better.
This may have made some sense ten or fifteen years ago, as outside attention to Nashville’s blossoming cosmopolitanism grew and the city began to imagine itself flourishing into something that might rate the adjective world-class. But taken to extremes, more-is-better means a shortage of forward-looking adults in the room ready to tap the brakes when the thing spins out. 
That spin has produced for us the opposite of world class: a city center that is principally a lucrative theme park of intoxication in which corporate operators profit off synthetic music celebrity branding, culinary mediocrity, and exploitation of talented musicians hustling for a subsistence living as country-rock human jukeboxes. 
It is also a downtown that many Nashvillians want little to do with. The same apparently can be said about business. The concerning downtown office vacancy rate I mentioned above isn’t just an artifact of post-Covid hybrid work; it’s in part due to some enterprises choosing to escape the theme park and relocate outside the heart of downtown. 
We have, quite simply, lost control of our downtown, with no relief in sight: the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp’s strategic plan gleefully projects significant growth in visitor spend and hotel occupancy through the mid-2030s. Those who profit off of it will inevitably insist that given how taxation works around here, a theme-park downtown is the price we must pay to fund everything else. 



				 Nashville’s city center is principally a lucrative theme park of intoxication in which corporate operators profit off synthetic music celebrity branding, culinary mediocrity, and exploitation of talented musicians hustling for a subsistence living as country-rock human jukeboxes.  


My rejoinder: a city without an active core that can commercially and culturally engage both locals and visitors is an uninteresting city, and a theme park for inebriated visitors doesn’t qualify. The idea that untamed growth makes all the other good stuff possible would be more compelling if we had more to show for what we have let tourism become over the last 15 years beyond incremental improvements in generally mediocre regimes of education, transportation, and attainable housing.
I don’t want to suggest there has been an absence of forward-looking thinking in and about the city. Last year’s Imagine Nashville project, self-described as a “community-led process to unify the city around a set of priorities and actions to guide Nashville over the next decade,” is an ambitious example. Its final report—subtitled “A Vision for Nashville’s Future”— offered a large array of goals, metrics, and action ideas in four buckets: standards of living, transit, housing, and neighborhood quality of life. It’s a strong document, but their ambit apparently didn’t include much attention to the city’s commercial and geographic center. 
It has become fashionable to put untethered growth on notice. “Growth brings mostly benefits and advantages if it is more carefully managed,” reads the Imagine Nashville report. The challenge is to grow “in a smart way … showing duty of care of the city and that we want to protect it,” says Convention and Visitors Corp CEO Deana Ivey.
Charming thoughts but it’s all lip service, and it’s getting old. Many look around downtown Nashville and think: Well, better this than the hollow shell of commercial decay it was thirty years ago. That’s not an insane position. But you can also look around and ask: Who did this to us and how do we make it stop? And by the way does anyone seriously think that doubling the size of the Music City Center and building more hotels so we can stuff more conventioneers and bachelorettes into more cookie-cutter celebrity bars is the answer?

(Photo courtesy of Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel)The Chesapeake Bay is one of Virginia’s top economic drivers and premiere recreational sites. The commonwealth, as well as surrounding states, have taken strides to clean up the waters over the last decade. But as the estuary faces new, climate change-fueled challenges, researchers will provide critical information and recommendations to lawmakers this weekend on how to meet the obstacles head on.
A joint meeting of the General Assembly’s Agriculture and Natural Resources committees will convene at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science’s Eastern Shore Laboratory July 11 and 12 to learn more about the state’s part in the Chesapeake watershed agreement, flood resiliency, oyster farming, saltwater intrusion, and how agriculture plays a role in cleaning the bay.
“We’re not just talking about thriving wildlife and habitat. We’re also talking about engaging communities and protecting our land and protecting our water, to think of it all as one interconnected body,” said Adrienne Kotula, Virginia Director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission.
She will speak about the state’s agricultural conservation programs and how they work to reduce the pollution runoff into the bay.. Virginia has made record investments in the cost share program that gives farmers grant funding to implement conservation projects such as specific cover crop growth, animal waste control, and dozens of other methods.

“We also talk about whether there are ways to better incentivize some of the practices that provide a lot of pollution reduction benefit, and ways to make sure that all of the benefits of the practices are fully understood by the people implementing them as well on their own farms,” Kotula said.
Sediment runoff has been reduced, she said, and the state is nearing its goals for nutrient runoff reduction. 
Virginia has achieved 84% of its 2009-2025 reduction goal for nitrogen, 91% of its reduction goal for phosphorus and 100% of its reduction goal for sediment, according to Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon. The watershed agreement will have a refresh at the end of this year to find gaps in the pollution reduction. 
Taillon is also working under a 2024 directive from Youngkin to reevaluate investments in the bay to make sure they are the best ways to drive progress. She also is tasked with assisting farmers with implementing the conservation programs and looking at ways to preserve wetlands and other living resources. She said the state’s oyster population is at a 40-year high and there have been efforts to restore reefs in five bay tributaries.
At the joint meeting, lawmakers will get an up-close look at the conservation programs in action. 
“One of the demonstrations we’ll do is show soil from one plot that has been basically tilled to death over the last, you know, 100 years,” said Mark Reiter, the Director of the Eastern Shore Agriculture Research and Extension Center hosted by Virginia Tech. “Then from just 10 feet away show another soil that’s been under these practices that are receiving a cost share [grant] for the last 15 years, just to show the stark differences, and you wouldn’t even think it’s the same material. You would think it’s completely a different soil from a different part of the country.”
Panelists will show legislators how building flood resilient communities can aid in those goals. Several projects aimed at helping with flood mitigation and dam repairs have been cut from federal spending, leaving some communities in coastal zones in repeated flooding events.
Federal cuts hit coastal flooding, dam projects

Jessica Whitehead, a professor at Old Dominion University, recently told legislators in Norfolk that the few grants that are still available have increased demand and the rules for who qualifies have been altered. This leaves more projects up to the state to pay for in order to combat coastal flooding and erosion.
Legislators will visit oyster farms and marshes to learn how the health of the bay impacts habitats and fisheries. Saltwater intrusion onto farmlands on the Eastern Shore concerns farmers and researchers who are looking for ways to slow down the land loss and sea level rise.
“We find the saltwater is creeping in along the edges. It’s like a farmer loses one tractor row at a time over a course of years,” said Cora Baird, site director for the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-term Ecological Research. “The edge of the field doesn’t produce great crops, and so the next year, they just decide not to waste the seed on that little corner, and then that little corner expands. And so they’re losing little pieces of an acre at a time. But there is very clear data showing that loss is increasing over time.”
One way Eastern Shore farmers can slow down the saltwater seeping into their cropland, especially during storm surges, is by planting salt resistant vegetation in the buffer zones between the land and waterways.
Right now farmers can get tax credits for plants and trees through the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, but if the plants die – as many are in the salty waters on the edges of the land, then the farmers can’t get the credit. Baird hopes legislators would consider altering the program to include the salt resistant plants.
“If we can encourage the things that naturally stabilize shoreline, deal well with salt, that sort of thing, those will hopefully have better effects on the long term stability of the land and protecting it from further coastal intrusion,” Baird said.
The road to a healthier Chesapeake Bay is more than just cleaning up the water, it is flood resilience, farming, recreation, and public interaction. Scientists and environment advocates hope that the legislators can see how investments in all these areas are critical to their goals in the watershed agreement and the overall success for the state.
“We have to focus and pay attention to the same issues, to ensure that we can farm for generations and also make money as a business, right? So nobody wants to be wasteful, so it’s just going to be an interesting thing to see all these different groups come together and everybody is going to hopefully see that we’re all focused on the same things,” Reiter said.
In the fiscal year 2026 budget, lawmakers allocated over $222 million outside of administrative costs to pay for air, water and land protections. Over $30 million was put towards marine life management while land and resource management received over $144 million. As legislators grapple with reduced federal funding, they must determine how state money should be spent on the state’s scope of environmental needs.

Jim Jordan knew about the sexual abuse the student-athletes suffered, according to HBO’s new documentary, “Surviving Ohio State.”
Jordan declined to be interviewed for the documentary, but his name is frequently brought up by former Ohio State wrestlers and a referee. The documentary came out last month. Over the years, Jordan has repeatedly denied having any knowledge of the abuse.

“To say that (Jordan) knew nothing, that nothing ever happened, it’s a flat out lie,” former Ohio State Wrestler Dan Ritchie said in the documentary. 
Strauss sexually abused at least 177 male victims between 1979 and 1996 during his time as a physician for Ohio State’s Athletics Department and at the university’s Student Health Center, according to an independent investigation commissioned by Ohio State University. 
Strauss retired from Ohio State University in 1998 and died by suicide in 2005 when he was 67. Jordan was an Ohio State assistant wrestling coach from 1987 to 1995. 
“Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it,” said Russell Dye, spokesperson for Jordan.
At one point in the documentary, Ritchie said Jordan claimed, “If (Strauss) ever did that to me, I’d snap his neck like a stick of dry balsa wood.”
In the documentary, wrestling referee Fred Feeney shared his experience with Strauss sexually assaulting him in the shower after a wrestling match.
He said he told then Ohio State Wrestling Coach Russ Hellickson and Jordan that Strauss was masturbating beside Feeney in the shower.

“Jim Jordan looked at me straight in my face and said, ‘It’s Strauss. You know what he does,’” Feeney said in the documentary. 
Jordan turned to politics after coaching — serving in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1995 to 2000 and the Ohio State Senate from 2001 to 2006 before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where he represents Ohio’s 4th Congressional District. He is up for reelection next year. 
Former Ohio State wrestler Mike Schyck said he thought Jordan would help the Strauss abuse survivors. 
“Jim Jordan is a pit bull,” Schyck said in the documentary. “And so I figured why in the hell wouldn’t this guy step up for us?” 
The documentary shows television clips of Jordan adamantly denying he knew about the abuse.  
“I’ve stood up to the FBI,” Jordan said when pressed by NBC4 reporter Colleen Marshall in a clip from the documentary. “I’ve stood up to the IRS. So if I thought there was something wrong, if I knew there was something wrong happening, I would have stood up for them.” 
“There was no truth to the fact that I knew of any abuse,” Jordan said in July 2018 during a press gaggle with central Ohio reporters. “I’ve talked to other coaches, they didn’t know about any abuse. It’s just not accurate to say those things, that we know of it and didn’t report it. It’s just not true.”
Ohio State University has settled with 296 survivors who sued the university for more than $60 million. 
“We express our deep regret and apologies to all who experienced Strauss’ abuse,” Ohio State University Spokesperson Chris Booker said in an email. “… All male students who filed lawsuits have been offered the opportunity to settle.”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he has not seen “Surviving Ohio State,” but recently referenced the working group he established back in 2019 in response to the Strauss abuse that sought a review of medical board sexual misconduct cases for the last 25 years. 
“I’m confident that we, at that point, did everything that we could do and we look forward to the future in regard to making sure that the medical board reacts, when there are reports that come in, in an appropriate way and has the expertise within that board, and the right people,” DeWine said Monday when asked about the documentary.  
DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 109 into law last year which enables the State Medical Board of Ohio to hold licensees accountable when they engage in sexual misconduct or commit sexual crimes.

Low prices for row crops and high costs for fertilizer are squeezing Midwest row-crop farmers while the Southeast is still on an economic winning streak, according to a Stateline analysis of federal economic data for the first quarter. (Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, pause on foreign aid

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
USDA cuts hit small farms as Trump showers billions on big farms

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Janet Mills reacts after challenging President Donald Trump over federal law on the issue of transgender athletes in school sports as Trump addressed a meeting of governors at the White House on Feb. 21, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Gov. Janet Mills delivered an optimistic yet cautious update on Maine’s efforts to combat the opioid epidemic at the state’s seventh Opioid Response Summit Thursday, highlighting the state’s largest decrease in drug overdose deaths in seven years.
Fatal overdoses dropped by more than 21% from January to June this year, and the total number of non-fatal overdoses has also decreased by more than 18%, the governor said.
“Of course that’s welcome news, but we can’t feel complacent,” she said. “Every overdose, fatal and non-fatal, every one of them is a tragic, I believe, preventable loss or diminishment of a valued life.”
At the same time, Mills also mentioned two areas of concern: the rising use of methamphetamine, a non-opioid stimulant that has been known to cause violent behavior, and the cuts to Medicaid signed into law by President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” that will leave people without access to substance use disorder treatment.
Meth use has been spiking in Maine and across the country recently, according to New York Times reporting and Maine Drug Enforcement Agency enforcement data that Mills cited. This year, meth was identified in combination with fentanyl as a cause of death in 44% of confirmed fatal overdoses, marking a sharp increase in meth being present in fatal overdoses compared with 2024.
Unlike fentanyl overdoses which can be reversed by a drug called naloxone, there are no drugs to reverse meth, and no medications approved for treating addiction to it either. Part of why opioid overdose deaths are declining also has to do with an increase in meth use (which is not an opioid), said Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist who studies drugs and infectious diseases and keynote speaker at the summit.
There has also been a demographic shift in the people who are dying of overdoses, with fewer young people using opioids. Finally, more people are learning how to keep themselves safe, and “naloxone is a really important part of that,” Dasgupta said.
From 2020 to 2024, Maine has widely expanded access to the lifesaving overdose reversal medication, distributing 155,000 doses just last year, Mills said. 
In Lewiston, 300 7th and 8th grade students chose to participate in trainings on administering naloxone last year, Mills said. 
“The reality is, this epidemic has touched many, many lives across Maine, and many of those lives have been saved by Naloxone, sometimes administered by young family members,” she said. 
Some other strategies the governor highlighted include expanding access to more stable housing for people with chronic substance use disorder by creating more than 140 new housing units, adding treatment beds to recovery centers and hiring more staff for recovery residences, including recovery coaches, who offer peer support for people in these centers.
But access to opioid use disorder treatment using Maine’s Medicaid program, MaineCare, is now under threat. The Mills administration expanded MaineCare to cover more than 31,000 people receiving treatment for substance use. But with cuts to Medicaid because of the “big, beautiful bill,” Mills warned once again that Maine can’t sustain its progress in opioid use disorder treatment without federal support.
“The mega bill [Trump] signed into law last week, I believe, will decimate the very health care coverage that people in recovery rely on every day,” she said.
In the coming weeks, her administration will review the bill to determine the full scope of the damage from the bill, Mills said, including long term impacts on MaineCare.

(Photo: Billy Wolfe | ACLU photo)The North Carolina State Board of Education on Thursday formalized a ban on transgender athletes in middle and junior high school sports and reviewed the latest report on the growth and performance of charter schools across the state.
During its meeting, the board unanimously approved updates to its middle and junior high school athletics manual, formally incorporating a state law that bars transgender athletes from competing on teams that do not match their sex assigned at birth. The vote does not create new policy but aligns the manual with legislation that passed the General Assembly in June 2023 and became law in August 2023 after Republican lawmakers overrode a veto by former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Cooper had called the bill “a solution in search of a problem.”
The updated manual states that “boys shall not participate on a female team and girls shall not participate on a male team,” with limited exceptions, such as when no equivalent team exists. While the ban has been in place since the 2023–2024 school year, Thursday’s vote puts the rule directly into the handbook that governs athletic programs across the state.
The revised Middle/Junior High School Athletic Manual, set to take effect in the 2025–2026 school year, also updates how middle school sports are organized and regulated.
Brad Alford, the Department of Public Instruction’s athletics director, told the board the manual was overhauled into 10 clearer sections and stripped of high school-specific language to better fit middle school programs. It also swaps out gymnastics for lacrosse and adds new weight classes for girls’ wrestling, a sport that Alford said has seen steady growth across North Carolina.
The approved manual will be sent to school districts and athletic directors ahead of the 2025-2026 school year.
Chater schools
The board also reviewed the state’s annual charter school report, which showed that North Carolina’s 208 charter schools now enroll more than 153,000 students, 38,000 more than six years ago. Along with that growth, charter schools have become more diverse, with white student enrollment falling from over 60% in 2010 to around 45% in 2024.
The number of Asian students has more than doubled and Hispanic enrollment has nearly tripled, though Hispanic students remain underrepresented overall. Black student enrollment has stayed relatively steady during that time, according to the state’s annual charter school report.
Despite steady growth, North Carolina’s charter schools continue to face challenges with more than 53% of school leaders citing teacher retention as their top concern, followed by budget pressures and academic recovery from pandemic learning losses. Student proficiency across key subgroups remains below pre-pandemic levels as of 2024, according to the report.
Academically, 68% of North Carolina charter schools earned A, B, or C performance grades, and 70% met or exceeded growth standards. But overall student proficiency remains below pre-pandemic levels, with students with disabilities and Hispanic students facing the greatest academic challenges.
The report also highlighted transportation and facility funding as major challenges for charter schools. Charter schools receive just $2.5 million a year in state transportation grants, despite reporting more than $8 million in eligible expenses, leaving schools to cover the gap from their own budgets.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Becky-Pepper-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-11 06:10:47.681219

But boost comes amid federal cuts to nutrition assistance.","It was a bittersweet victory. 
After years of lobbying for more state funding, Connecticut’s food pantries secured $9 million in the biennium budget passed by lawmakers last month — $3 million for the coming fiscal year and $6 million in the following year, far more than the annual $850,000 previous budgets had allocated.
But almost before the ink was dry in Hartford, congressional lawmakers in Washington, D.C., slashed federal funding for food assistance programs in their sweeping budget reconciliation bill, which President Donald J. Trump signed into law last Friday.
“We are very appreciative to the state for giving us those extra funds,” said Jason Jakubowski, president of Connecticut Foodshare, which serves 600 pantries across the state. “Unfortunately, it will not come anywhere close to fully making up for the cuts that we’re seeing on the federal side of things.” 
The federal budget legislation cuts around $185 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, which supplements grocery budgets for low-income families. In Connecticut, more than 400,000 people got SNAP benefits in 2025, according to the state Department of Social Services. 
In a statement following the federal bill’s signing, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins praised the legislation, which includes tax relief for farmers and ranchers. “Through the President’s leadership, the bill Makes Agriculture Great Again, bolsters the farm safety net, makes crop insurance more affordable, and protects two million family farms from the death tax,” Rollins said.
“While expanding programs to support the farmers who feed, fuel, and clothe America, this legislation also tackles the fraud and waste that has run rampant in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),” Rollins’ statement continued. “The bill holds states accountable for their error rates, strengthens work requirements, and prevents illegal aliens from receiving SNAP. President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is a win for farmers, ranchers, rural communities, and American taxpayers.”
The SNAP cutbacks come after USDA canceled other nutrition assistance programs earlier this year — the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program and the Local Food for Schools program — that provided roughly $5 million to Connecticut schools and food banks to purchase fresh food from local farms. Days later, the agency canceled fresh food deliveries under another program, known as The Emergency Food Assistance Program or TEFAP.
“These [grant program] cuts, alongside the huge cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in the 900-page ‘Big Beautiful Bill’, show that the Trump Administration is not interested in helping families with the affordability crisis,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-CT-2nd District, who voted ‘No’ on the bill. 
Still, the boost in state funding was a significant increase from years past and moves Connecticut slightly closer to the levels of funding neighboring states provide for nutritional assistance. New Jersey and Massachusetts, for example, have contributed $85 million and $41.5 million respectively to their food banks in recent years. 
A portion of that new funding in both years will now need to go toward replacing LFPA funds, according to Jakubowski. And once federal SNAP cuts take effect — in the coming years — more families are likely to seek food assistance at the state’s food pantries.
“I’m especially concerned about the USDA’s termination of the LFPA — it was both cruel and short sighted,” said state Rep. Aundre Bumgardner, D-Groton, cosponsor of failed state legislation that sought $20 million in the biennium budget for nutrition assistance. Bumgardner said the result will be hungrier families and fewer resources, especially in his district in eastern Connecticut.

Pressured pantries 
The funding concerns have arisen at an overwhelming time for food pantries. 
Summer can be particularly challenging for their operations. With children out of school, pantries face higher demand — but donations tend to drop off from their usual apex during the December holiday season.
Organizations like Hands on Hartford, Person to Person and Friendly Hands Food Bank say the elevated seasonal demand comes after a sustained trend over the past year or more of client demand exceeding expectations. Food pantry leaders say they’re facing as much demand now as they did in 2020, during the peak of the pandemic.
“People do face a lot of food insecurity, and with the food costs going up, I think it’s important for us to stay around and be able to help,” said Jennica Torres, who oversees Hands on Hartford’s choice community food pantry. Seniors living on fixed income among the most affected, Torres said, as the cost of food has risen. 
At 24.6%, Hartford’s food insecurity rate is the highest in the state. Since late 2023, staff and volunteers at Hands on Hartford’s food pantry has consistently served roughly 1,000 households per month — well over the 850 they budget for. At first, they thought it was a temporary blip, but the monthly numbers have remained elevated.
CT Foodshare said their partner pantries have faced a 10% increase in the number of individuals served since February. According to Feeding America, food insecurity in Connecticut increased from 10% in 2019 to 14% in 2023. 
“We are seeing long lines as long as we were during the pandemic,” said Jakubowski, noting that federal and state funds were boosted to food pantries during COVID-19. “But the amount of food that we have to give out is back to where it was pre-pandemic,” he said.
And once federal SNAP cuts come into play, Jakubowski said he expects demand to rise even further.

Friendly Hands Food Bank in Torrington is the biggest pantry in northwestern Connecticut, serving over 10,000 individuals each month. Executive Director Karen Thomas said the pantry is seeing clients from the COVID-19 pandemic return and reactivate their accounts to seek food assistance. 
She noted that funding cuts to CT Foodshare, which supplies Friendly Hands with groceries, would in turn affect them. “This produces a trickle-down effect wherein if their money gets cut, they have less food to offer our pantry,” she said. 
Person to Person (P2P) operates four self-select pantries, two in Darien and Norwalk, and two mobile pantries in Stamford. Although the demand in Darien and Norwalk has leveled off, P2P’s mobile pantries are now serving double the number of people they served during the pandemic. 
Less than a quarter of the organization’s budget comes from DSS, and a large portion is donated. P2P also receives TEFAP contributions from CT Foodshare, which the organization anticipates will soon be cut back.

Early childhood education. Across much of the rest of the world, free, public early childhood education is a basic right.
At a time in which it’s necessary for almost all parents to work in order to make ends meet, these nations have long recognized that there’s no good reason to hold off on providing free public education until children enter Kindergarten.
If it hopes to continue to compete and advance, at some point, the U.S. simply must move to make free public education from birth a basic right.
Until that time, however, there are some obvious and commonsense steps that should be taken in order to make early childhood education more affordable, and to its credit, a state task force led by Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt recently recommended several – including raising state child care subsidies, establishing partnerships with North Carolina public schools and universities and creating a state child care endowment.
The bottom line: The current state child care system is broken. And the task force recommendations are an obvious first step toward constructing something much better.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Two years ago, Nicolle Orozco Forero walked into an in-home day care in Seattle, Washington, looking for a job. She was barely 22, a whole five feet tall — if that. But she was calm, focused. Her presence struck the owner, Stephanie Wishon, because it’s not easy to find qualified staff who can work with children with disabilities.
Orozco Forero had experience working with kids who had autism back in Colombia, so Wishon had her come in for a trial run and hired her after the first day. The children, who needed someone who had love and care to give in abundance, gravitated toward her. She was good at the hardest stuff. She changed diapers and outfits the moment they were soiled. She was vigilant; her kids stayed pristine. And she got them to do the things they wouldn’t do for other people, like say “ah” when it was time to get their teeth brushed or sit still long enough for her to twist a braid down their back.
Some people just have that way about them.
And people like Orozco Forero are exceptionally rare. Already, the staffing shortage in child care is near crisis levels. It’s far worse for children with disabilities — about a third of those families say they face significant difficulty finding care for their kids, partly because there are too few people with the ability, expertise or desire to work with their children. Immigrant women like Orozco Forero have been helping to fill that void. They now make up 20 percent of all child care workers.
At home, Orozco Forero was also caring for her own young boys, one of whom started to show symptoms of a serious illness over the past two years that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose. She took some time off to care for him last year, before returning to the kids at Wishon’s day care.
Her work has kept an already precarious safety net together. Without women like Orozco Forero, families who have nowhere else to turn for care have to make difficult decisions about how to survive and keep their children safe. Without her, the safety net snaps.
And that’s exactly what happened on June 18, the day she was detained.

It was supposed to be a routine meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Orozco Forero and her husband had been to all their monthly meetings for the past year and change, since their asylum charge was denied in April 2024.
The family — Orozco Forero; her husband, Juan Sebastian Moreno Acosta; and their two sons, Juan David, 7, and Daniel, 5 — fled Colombia two years ago. Moreno Acosta, a street vendor, had been persecuted by gangs who target vendors for money.
After arriving in the United States, they sought the help of a lawyer with their asylum claim, but when they couldn’t pay his full fee ahead of their hearing, he pulled out. They represented themselves in court and lost the case. With no knowledge of the U.S. court system, they didn’t know they had 30 days to appeal the ruling, either. Ever since, ICE has been monitoring them, requiring they wear a wrist tracker and meet with an immigration officer once a month, sometimes more, according to a family member. (The 19th is not naming the family member to protect their identity.) It’s unclear why ICE has allowed them to stay in the country all this time, though it’s not necessarily uncommon; ICE typically prioritized immigrants with felonies for deportation.
Orozco Forero had seen the reports of illegal immigrants being rounded up at their immigration appointments. President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort has led to the detention of about 30,000 migrants with no criminal record, like Orozco Forero, who now make up about half of those detained. Her husband does have a misdemeanor reckless driving conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol on his record, but he completed a court-mandated alcohol course for that and has no other convictions.
Still, Orozco Forero wasn’t worried when she headed to her appointment on the morning of June 18. If ICE planned to detain her, Orozco Forero thought, they would have asked her to come with the boys, right?
And she had been doing everything right: She’d gone to all her appointments, taken documentation to show she was going to school at Green River Community College taking courses in English and early childhood education. She had completed a child care internship that trained her to open her own licensed in-home day care. Her licensure approval was set to arrive any moment, likely that same week, and the day care was just about ready to go.
But that morning, her family was still wary, asking her to share her location just in case.
Shortly after 10 a.m., Orozco Forero texted her family member: “They are going to deport us”
“Nicolle what happened? Nicolle answer me,” they texted back. “What do I do?”
“I can’t speak I feel like I’m going to faint,” Orozco Forero replied. And then: “I’m sorry it wasn’t what we expected.”

Two-and-a-half hours west, on the coast of Washington in a town called Southbend, Wishon was frantic. Orozco Forero had texted her, too. ICE was asking for the boys.
In two years, Wishon had grown incredibly close to Orozco Forero, who had cared for her own kids. After her family moved to the coast, Wishon rented out her house in Seattle to Orozco Forero, whose boys were excited to have a home with a yard.
Wishon’s husband, Gabriel, hopped into his truck and headed to Seattle. Wishon, meanwhile, got on the phone with the Orozco Forero family’s ICE agent and every lawyer she could. They were going to take them into detention at a facility 2,200 miles away in Texas, a facility that was reopened earlier this year by the Trump administration to detain families. Wishon wanted to find a lawyer who could stop the deportation order, and she wanted to make sure the boys would be reunited with their parents if they took them to meet the ICE agent.

For the past year, he’s been seeking treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital for an illness that is turning his urine muddy. So far, doctors have determined he’s losing red blood cells and protein through his urine, indicating a possible kidney issue, but they haven’t yet zeroed in on what is causing the problem. They likely need a kidney biopsy to be sure.
“Given the complexity of his case, it is essential that Juan remain in the United States for continued testing and treatment,” his nephrologist Jordan Symons wrote in a March letter to ICE. “We kindly request that you consider this medical necessity in your review of his immigration status and grant him the ability to stay in the United States until his treatment and evaluation are completed.”
Juan David’s care team has been monitoring him closely to ensure his red blood cell and protein levels never drop too low. His condition could become serious quickly.
“You can die from that,” said Sarah Kasnick, a physician’s assistant who is familiar with his case. Kasnick is also a foster parent, and Orozco Forero provided care for her family.
When Gabriel Wishon arrived to pick up the boys, they were confused and disoriented. Where were their parents? Why was everyone crying? They didn’t want to go to Colombia, they told him on the drive. They wanted to stay in the United States.
Around 5:30 p.m. that evening, he met with the ICE agent, who had waited past her work hours for them to arrive.
“Bye boys, you are going to see your parents right now. They are right inside,” Wishon told them. He watched them walk in carrying two stuffed animals, a Super Mario doll and Chase, the popular cartoon dog dressed as a police officer.

The families Orozco Forero cares for are now in a free fall.
Jessica Cocson, whose son has been in Orozco Forero’s care for more than a year, described her in a character letter to ICE as a “blessing to us in ways I struggle to fully express.”
Orozco Forero and her husband “support working families, provide quality childcare, and demonstrate compassion and commitment every day,” Cocson wrote. “It is heartbreaking to think that someone who gives so much and asks so little could be forced to leave.”
Tamia Riley, whose two sons with autism were also in Orozco Forero’s care, said losing her was like watching “a father walking out the door.”
“These people, these day care providers, sitters, they are a form of family members for me and my children,” Riley said.
Now, the day care she was set to open lays empty. Inside, the walls are plastered with posters listing colors and sight words. There are cushioned mats on the floor and play stations. Tables with tiny chairs. A tall pink dollhouse. High chairs and a pack and play for the babies. Outside, two play houses, a ball pit, toys to ride on and little picnic tables set across an artificial turf. But no children to enjoy any of it.
Big Dreams Day Care she was going to call it, for the dreams she wanted the kids in her care to strive for, and the ones that were finally coming to fruition for her.
Orozco Forero’s detention has rattled child care workers across the country. In Texas, workers represented by the Service Employees International Union have been rallying in her name. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, spoke in support of the family’s release at a rally on June 29 in San Antonio. And a group of union workers is attempting to deliver supplies to the family. It’s an effort Orozco Forero knows little about; she only has limited communication with those on the outside.
Tricia Schroeder, the president of the Seattle-based SEIU chapter that represents care workers, said that, for years unions like hers have been working to improve quality, access and affordability in child care, a system in such deep crisis it’s been called by the Treasury Department “a textbook example of a broken market.”
Immigrant women like Orozco Forero were part of that effort to improve access, doing jobs few Americans want to take on.
“Detaining child care providers, especially those who care for kids with special needs, just deepens the crisis in early learning,” Schroeder said.

Orozco Forero was also the connective tissue that kept families employed. Her loss has rippled across industries.
Kasnick, the foster parent, said one of the children in her care had been tentatively set to start at Orozco Forero’s day care as soon as it opened. Orozco Forero had been the only provider who would take the child, who has autism and is nonverbal.
Orozco Forero had cared for the girl at Wishon’s day care as if she was her own, even taking her in once when the child’s care had fallen through and no foster family in the entire county would take her in because of the complexity of her needs. The girl arrived at Orozco Forero’s house at midnight on a weekend “with no clothing, toys, medication or any of her belongings … this did not [deter] Nicolle and Sebastian instead they immediately went and purchased all the things” the child needed, a social worker wrote in a letter to ICE. Kasnick said Orozco Forero was even considering becoming a foster parent.
Without her, Kasnick is out of options: She quit her job as a physician’s assistant to care for the child after Orozco Forero was detained.
“There are now 44 patients a day who don’t have anyone to provide their health care, and I can’t go to work because Nicolle’s day care didn’t open,” Kasnick said.
In the weeks since, Kasnick has had an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, she said. How could this happen to someone who gave back so much?
“The security of knowing that you can be in your home one day and in a prison the next week, and you didn’t do anything except exist?” she said. “It makes you feel like there’s no good left in the world.”

Orozco Forero’s family has now been in ICE detention for nearly a month awaiting a bond hearing that could buy them time in the United States. Orozco Forero and the boys are together; her husband is in the same facility but separated from them.
Juan David hasn’t been eating. It took three weeks for him to receive medical care, Orozco Forero told her attorney, James Costo.
Costo has been working to get the details of why ICE allowed the family to stay in the country with monitoring after they lost their asylum case last year. There has been an order for their deportation since then, but ICE never attempted to deport them until the Trump administration ramped up efforts. The number of immigrants without criminal convictions who have been detained has doubled since May.
The process to fight an asylum claim and appeal a denial is complicated — there are court deadlines, documents that need to be submitted and translated.
“They think maybe they can do it themselves and go in and say what happened but they are not understanding the whole legal process,” Costo said. “The system isn’t made for things to be easy.”
Costo is hopeful a judge will allow them to stay in the country temporarily as Juan David seeks care. They have almost no family left in Colombia, and no way to obtain care for him there, their family said. If they can stay, then perhaps Orozco Forero could try to obtain a work visa as a domestic worker.
He has gathered letters of support from numerous people whose lives the Orozco Forero family touched, and Wishon set up a GoFundMe to cover her legal expenses.
In the letters, Juan David’s first grade teachers call him an exceptional student who went from one of the lowest reading levels in the class — 10 words a minute — to one of the highest at 70 words a minute.
“He shows the qualities of a model citizen at a young age — dependable, ethical, and hard-working,” wrote his teacher, Carla Trujillo.
They were all on their way to shaping a better future, Wishon wrote in hers. The couple “worked tirelessly to build a better life for their children and to open their own licensed child care business. In all my years of employing and mentoring caregivers, I have rarely met a couple as responsible, driven, and capable as Nicolle and Sebastian.”
“This family is not a threat,” she concluded. “They are an asset.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/detentioncare-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-11 05:01:18.369562

The U.S. Supreme Court will consider the case during its upcoming term which begins in October.
Since its initial filing, the chief fundraising committees for GOP candidates in Congress, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee, have taken over as the lead plaintiffs.
In a social media post, NRSC chairman U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-SC, and NRCC chair U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-NC, welcomed the court’s review.
“The government should not restrict a party committee’s support for its own candidates,” they wrote. “These coordinated expenditure limits violate the First Amendment, and we appreciate the court’s decision to hear the case.”

The Supreme Court's decision to hear NRSC vs. FEC presents an opportunity for our party to reach its full potential.

Digging into the weeds
The petition argues that it makes perfect sense for parties to get a candidate’s input before speaking on their behalf, “and for nearly the first 200 years of our nation’s history, a party was free to do so.”
Campaign finance laws don’t actually prohibit committees like the NRSC and NRCC from spending on behalf of favored candidates. What they do is set a series of ground rules.
Independent expenditures — those made without candidates’ input — have no upper limit. Coordinated spending, however, faces limits tied to the state’s voting age population.
To petitioners, that amounts to “the campaign ‘equivalent of prohibiting communication between a coach and quarterback late in a tied game.’”
That analogy is a little misleading. Communication in game, like current campaign finance law, has its limits. The coach can’t coordinate with the quarterback whenever they want — the signal gets cut when the play clock hits 15 seconds.
In an even more aggressive analogy, petitioners compared an earlier decision maintaining campaign spending limits to “a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authority.”
It’s a well-known quote from the dissent in Korematsu, a notorious U.S. Supreme Court case upholding the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.
Still, the petitioners note court precedent holds the only grounds for limiting political speech is “the prevention of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.”
The limits at issue, they argue, were established to limit money in politics generally — a “constitutionally insufficient” purpose.
The committees dismiss as “implausible” the idea that donors might seek to influence a candidate by funneling money through the party apparatus. Just look at the rise of Super PACs, they argue.
“While party contributions to candidates have barely budged since 2004,” the petitioners contend, “non-party independent expenditures (including by Super PACs) have shot up by over 114 times in that period.”
The petitioners add a lower court “did not find any instance of quid pro quo corruption linked to coordinated party expenditures.”
Critics chime in
The Campaign Legal Center’s Senior Counsel for Campaign Finance David Kolker actually worked on case the NRSC and NRCC are trying to overturn.
“They’ve survived just fine for the past 50 years living with these limits,” he said. “So, the idea that the sky is falling is relatively absurd.”
Kolker emphasized they face no limit for independent expenditures, and the committees get greater leeway on coordinated expenditures than the average citizen.
He expects the petitioners will argue they’re at a disadvantage compared to other political spenders — a point which he disputes. But more fundamentally, Kolker argued, that perceived disadvantage comes from the court loosening or eliminating earlier campaign finance restrictions.
“The idea that the solution is to loosen even more restrictions rather than putting back the ones that had been in place, is unfortunate,” he said.
Catherine Turcer who heads up Common Cause Ohio, compared the current limits to a speed limit.
A lack of tickets in a 70-mph zone doesn’t mean it’s safe to push the speed limit higher. And after years of chipping away at campaign finance laws, the petitioners’ arguments ring a bit hollow and self-serving, she said.
“I do think there’s this thing of like, well, it’s just the wild, wild west out here,” Turcer said, “and that’s why we don’t want any rules on us.”
Despite their arguments to the contrary, Turcer worries if the Supreme Court sides with the committees, “wealthy donors could simply circumvent the individual contribution limits by just routing everything to the political parties.”
Turcer argued Ohioans have had a front row seat to political corruption cases in recent years, and it’s not hard to imagine “what happens when there is coordination with a candidate with large sums of money.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)In order to pay for tax breaks favoring the wealthy, the budget that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed on June 30 denied resources to improve state parks. A panel of Ohio economists unanimously said those parks are themselves an economic resource that should be protected.
After the state controversially undertook the unpopular measure of allowing fracking in the state parks, the parks themselves were supposed to get some of the money. Specifically, they were to get $30 million for facilities improvement. 
But under the new state budget, Ohio now has to pay for a $1.1 billion-a-year flat tax. The wealthiest 20% of households — those making more than $138,000 a year — will reap 96% of the benefit, according to Policy Matters Ohio. 
As a partial “pay-for,” the $30 million in fracking money that was to improve parks will now go to operate them and free up as much in general-fund spending. 
The move has not only prompted accusations that it uses money from fracking public lands to subsidize the wealthy, it also prompted fears that the boom-and-bust nature of fracking could jeopardize future state-park operations by making it dependent on them.
In a survey shortly after DeWine signed the budget, a panel of Ohio economists couldn’t have been any clearer: State parks are a wise investment. 
They were asked by Scioto Analysis if they agreed that, “Public spending on state parks is an efficient strategy for producing goods for Ohio residents like recreation, environmental quality, and health.”
All 19 said yes.
In the comment section of the survey, Kevin Egan of the University of Toledo said Ohio is relatively poor in parklands, and if fracking is to be allowed, it needs to be taxed.
“Ohio only has 0.77% of its land as state park and ranks 34th in the nation for federal or state lands,” he wrote. “The worst part is possibly reducing funding due to taxing fracking less. It is efficient to tax activities that cause pollution more, and then using those tax dollars for public parks is a ‘double dividend.'”
The economists were also asked about potential disinvestment in Ohio parks.
They were asked if they agreed that “Reducing funding for state parks will lead to long-term deterioration of natural assets that will reduce the future economic potential of those areas.” 
Fourteen agreed, two disagreed and three were uncertain.
“Obviously if investment spending has any positive effect, and you reduce it, then assets will not be as good in the future,” commented Jonathan Andreas of Bluffton University.

In a recent media call, the coalition Vouchers Hurt Ohio further celebrated the wins they obtained in a Franklin County court case that found the private school voucher program in the state unconstitutional.
“There is no Santa Claus, there is no Easter Bunny, and there is no such thing as school choice,” said Dan Heintz, a Cleveland Heights-University Heights School Board member and teacher at Chardon Local Schools. “The Ohio Constitution is real; school choice is a fairy tale.”
Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page ruled in favor of anti-voucher groups in three of the five counts included in the lawsuit.
The judge found that the General Assembly’s powers to “tax organize, administer and control the common school system” do not allow for “unlimited discretion.”
She agreed with anti-voucher groups’ claims that the private school voucher program in Ohio is receiving “substantially more state funding per student than public schools.”
She said that the level of funding for private school vouchers makes it “difficult to say that EdChoice is simply a scholarship that follows and/or benefits the students as opposed to a system that benefits private schools.”
In the two counts for which Page did not side with the voucher program challengers, plaintiffs claimed that the program was creating or increasing segregation in public schools by moving more white students out of those schools and into private alternatives.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The other count claimed the private voucher program created “disparities” based on different per-pupil funding for private schools and public schools, according to court records.
The state argued there was no evidence of the disparate treatment “because any Ohio student can choose to participate in the EdChoice program.”
“While it seems inevitable that some Ohio students might be excluded from the EdChoice program by a participating private school, none of the student plaintiffs have alleged or provided any evidence of denial of participation in the EdChoice program,” Page wrote in her June 24 decision.
While the leaders of the anti-voucher movement say they expect an appeal from the state on the three counts challengers won, the coalition plans to discuss its own appeal, on the other two counts.
A meeting of the Vouchers Hurt Ohio steering committee is scheduled for Wednesday, when Phillis said members will talk in executive session with lawyers about next steps.
Still, public school supporters in the fight are optimistic about their chances for success at the appellate level, even with a broad conservative majority in the Ohio Supreme Court.
“If the program is deemed unconstitutional on any of these counts, then that spigot of money, tax dollars … will be turned off,” said Vouchers Hurt Ohio spokesperson Dennis Willard.
Bill Phillis, coalition member and executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, was a part of the DeRolph v. State of Ohio cases in which the Ohio Supreme Court decided whether the public school funding model, relying on property taxes, followed the state constitution.
Multiple court cases under the DeRolph name were decided by the state’s highest court, and in all of them it found that the state was not properly funding public schools in accordance with the state constitution.
During those cases, Phillis said there was skepticism that the cases would be successful, and those, too, were decided under a majority Republican supreme court.
“We’re moving forward with the understanding that the people on the court have some integrity, and Judge Page has identified that the EdChoice voucher program in this case is unconstitutional,” Phillis said.
As a former chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, Vouchers Hurt Ohio steering committee chair Eric Brown said he has no doubt the court will uphold their oath as justices.
“My former colleagues on the Ohio Supreme Court, regardless of their party, are sworn to follow the law,” Brown said. “They’re sworn to follow the Ohio Constitution and I believe that they will do that.”
Despite their staunch opposition to the private school voucher program, public school advocates said they don’t blame Page for keeping the program active as the case goes forward because of the enormous lift it would be to transition students from private school districts to public school districts amid the lawsuit.
“It’s a major disruption to students in schools to implement this decision right away, and the courts are not interested in doing that unless it’s really necessary,” Brown said.
Parties have 30 days from the time of the decision to file their appeal in the case.
The Ohio Attorney General’s Office did not return a request for comment Thursday on plans for an appeal.

Your response, dear reader, might be: “Why were you wondering about that? And why couldn’t you remember that it’s actually the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act?”
The occasion of my peculiar U.S. history question was this Monday’s release of Advanced Placement scores to American high school students around the country. Students logged in to the College Board’s website for the dramatic reveal.
For some, the score aimed to reflect what they knew about U.S. history — Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and all.
Would they earn a 5, the highest possible score, and virtually guarantee themselves college credit? Would they earn a 3 and achieve the significant score that signifies “passing” the exam?
Or would they fall short, earning a score of 1? (This is where my “Smoot Talley” misremembering would have slotted my score these days.)
In addition to meaning loads to the students who completed the exams, I found this week’s results interesting for two reasons. First, because of how Kansas students have ranked low in their participation rates but recorded above-average scores.
And second, because I predict that artificial intelligence will shift our view of these exams and the knowledge they test.

Near the bottom
At the end of each school year, AP tests evaluate high school students for their subject knowledge on many typical high school topics: chemistry, physics, government, psychology and world languages like Spanish and German.
Many high schools offer AP courses as honors equivalents. Typically, the most rigorous teachers and the most dedicated students sign up for a year of prepping for the exams together.
The College Board also provides AP Awards, celebrating ambitious students “who receive scores of 3 or higher on three or more AP Exams.” Even more accomplished students can be named AP Scholars with Honor or AP Scholars with Distinction.
Even with these possible accolades, AP tests seem deeply unpopular in Kansas, as compared to other states.
For the high school class of 2024 (the most recent year with statewide data), the state of Kansas ranked last among all states in the percentage of students who participated in an AP exam. The nationwide average was 35.7% compared to the Kansas average of 15.5%.
Add to that the Kansas participation has trended downward, falling 1.7 percentage points between 2014 and 2024.
Meanwhile, the exams continue to grow in popularity nationwide. For some exams, the number of test takers has increased 10-fold between 2002 and 2024. A few particular AP exams attract more than 300,000 high school students annually.
While the total number of test takers is not available yet for 2025, most states have shown growth during the previous 10 years.
When it comes to achieving that all-important score of 3, Kansas was also near the bottom in 2024. Nationwide, about 1 in 4 students earn a score of 3. In Kansas, just more than 1 in 10 student graduates earn that score. That’s 47th place among the 50 states plus the District of Columbia.
What is the cause for the participation gap when comparing Kansas to the country overall?
A report from Advanced Placement on course availability shows Kansas lagging. Nationwide, 48% of schools offer at least five AP classes. In Kansas? Only 18%. Schools with at least 10 AP courses are three times as likely elsewhere as compared to Kansas.
Many Midwestern states with low population density sit near the bottom of the nationwide lists for test participation and test scores, including Kansas, South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa and Oklahoma.
It’s difficult for schools to schedule multiple sections — both AP and regular history, for instance — if a small high school has only a handful of graduates each year.
Another possibility: Kansas educators need to nudge students more often toward AP courses and testing. Many tentative students need a bit of encouragement to believe they can do well in a challenging class.
Last year’s AP results support this. The average Kansas score across all but one racial group was above the national average. So, Kansas students are scoring well, when they opt to try the exam.
 
AI vs. AP
As a college instructor, I am interested in how these AP subject exams will fare in the rising age of artificial intelligence. A key component of many of these exams is recall of vital subject matter, whether it’s the year the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter for U.S. history or the function of mitochondria in a cell’s structure for the biology exam.
As a former high school student who once took AP tests, I was bedeviled by the complexity of the questions. They were rarely simple recall questions. When I write exam questions today for my introductory course in journalism at the University of Kansas, I aim toward challenging, AP-style questions.
So, AP knowledge is more than simple recall.
Nevertheless, who in 2025 isn’t going to use artificial intelligence for a quick summary of the Teapot Dome Scandal? Even if you earned a 5 just a few months ago, you’re likely to want that reassurance when AI and the internet team up to make it quick, free and easy.
Education Week pointed out that current artificial intelligence can pass almost any AP exam.
Because AI is prohibited from almost every exam on testing day, the exams are a knowledge laboratory — some might say a contrived laboratory.
The College Board is aware of this challenge from artificial intelligence, according to its CEO, David Coleman.
In March, he said this to Education Week in a Q&A:
“What we definitely are thinking about is, ‘How can students skillfully use AI without replacing their own skills development? How can you use AI resourcefully and powerfully without it totally eclipsing what you’re trying to get kids to learn?’ (…)
“I think that interplay is essential for advancement in the AI world. We always want the check and balance of what can you do with it and what can you do without it, to see what you’re gaining separately from (the course).”
In the face of my AI vs. AP skepticism, students nationwide seem to be performing as well this year as previous years. Comparing the nationwide scores from 2024 to 2025, you find that the percentage of students who earned a score of 3 or better held steady for most exams this year. In the short term at least, AI is not fouling their brains.
In fact, the scores rose dramatically this year for a few exams — notably Physics I, Environmental Science and English Language & Composition.
Perhaps students are hearing the advice of their guidance counselors and parents who want them to use impeccable exam scores to polish their academic resumes for selective schools who value high scores on AP exams. After all, that is the top reason listed by Advanced Placement, which says “taking the exam demonstrates your commitment to tackle and complete college-level work.”
And if we worry about the effect AI is having on students’ writing skills, we should be encouraged by the number of students nationwide who earned high scores this year on the English Language and Composition exam.
Before this year, the percentage of students who earned 3 or better on the exam nationwide never eclipsed 63%. This year, 74% of students earned one of those valuable scores. It’s difficult to imagine that AI tools are making students better writers when they don’t have access to the tool.
Some might argue that the rise of AI — in addition to having the internet — makes it less vital that we have AP exams. Just the first few letters of “bicameral” typed into Google provides links galore. As students have asked for centuries, “Why do we need to learn this stuff?”
Or as 2025 graduates are asking, “Why do we need to learn this stuff when the robots have our backs?”
My heady, academic response is that having these facts about basic subjects on recall is still a vital part of being an informed person in the world. That is super flimsy to today’s students, of course.
As educators in an age of AI, we must have a more convincing answer to their skepticism.
Here’s a more honest, gritty response: Working diligently to master difficult subject matter is the skill. The hard work. The diligence. The organization of knowledge. The muddling through arcana.
(AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, anyone?)
The skill of intellectual grit has been the most important result of academic challenges, whether AP, honors or International Baccalaureate classes.
It seems likely, although not certain, that the same type of academic perseverance will remain a valuable trait, even in a world reordered by AI.

Scopes, charged with teaching about evolution during a biology lesson at Rhea County High School. (Photo by Topical Press Agency/Getty Images)Today I’m remembering what Lela Scopes told me about her famous brother for my Paducah Sun story going on 46 years ago.
She said before John Thomas Scopes left to teach science and coach football at Rhea County High School in Dayton, Tenn., in 1924, he explained, “I’m going there because it’s a small town with a small school where I won’t get in any deep water.”
The skinny, bespectacled, freckle-faced 24-year-old from Paducah ended up the defendant in one of history’s most sensationalized courtroom battles.
A century ago this month, Scopes was convicted of violating the Butler Act, a Volunteer State law that forbade the teaching of evolution in public schools. His punishment was a $100 fine.
But the “Monkey Trial” grabbed newspaper headlines worldwide. Dozens of reporters converged on Dayton. So did tent revivalists and swarms of hucksters hawking popcorn and pink lemonade and hustling Bibles and souvenirs, including stuffed monkeys.

“The State of Tennessee v John Thomas Scopes” was also the first trial broadcast live on radio.
I interviewed Lela Scopes in August 1979, when I was a Sun feature writer. She also said John had worried about what their mother might think of the trial: “He was afraid it would get in the Louisville paper, Mother would read about it and think he was a hothead.”
Anyway, as Mark Twain said, “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” and now is one of those rhyming times.
“Public education is once again under siege from a sustained effort by Christian Nationalists to blur the line between church and state,” warns A.J. Schumann, a youth organizing fellow with Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
Like today, the 1920s were times of “rapid social, economic and cultural change,” said David Krueger, professor emeritus of history at West Kentucky Community and Technical College in Paducah.
Scopes admitted he covered evolution when he substitute taught for the absent biology teacher. (In their zeal to ban evolution, Tennessee lawmakers failed to remove the state-approved biology textbook, which included evolution.)
Scopes believed in evolution and agreed to stand trial on principle.
The trial, which began on July 10, 1925, and concluded on July 21, was essentially a clash of competing values: urban science and modernism versus rural, old-time Protestant fundamentalist Christianity.

“The cause defended at Dayton is a continuing one that has existed throughout man’s brief history and will continue as long as man is here,” Scopes wrote in “Center of the Storm,” his 1967 memoir. “It is the cause of freedom, for which man must do what he can.”
The attorneys embodied the collision of values. Tennessee summoned William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska as special prosecutor. A fundamentalist champion, he had been a Democratic congressman, secretary of state and three-time Democratic presidential candidate.
The American Civil Liberties Union hired Clarence Darrow to lead Scopes’ defense team. Darrow was widely considered the country’s top defense lawyer. He was from Chicago, believed in evolution and was an agnostic.
Bryan and Darrow dueled like gladiators in the sweltering midsummer East Tennessee heat. The courtroom became so hot that the trial was moved outdoors to the tree-shaded courthouse lawn where the crowd of spectators grew even larger.
Bryan got a conviction as expected. But progressives, including liberal Christians, believed science and reason had vanquished “EVIL-lution” in the court of public opinion. They pointed to July 20 when Darrow called Bryan to the stand as a Bible expert.
“There was no pity for the helplessness of the believer come so suddenly and so unexpectedly upon a moment when he could not reconcile statements of the Bible with generally accepted facts,” The New York Times reported. “There was no pity for his admissions of ignorance of things boys and girls learn in high school, his floundering confessions that he knew practically nothing of geology, biology, philology, little of comparative religion, and little even of ancient history.”










... separation of church and state is not something we can take for granted. It is a principle that must be actively defended, especially in moments of cultural anxiety and political division, when calls to return to some mythic past grow loudest.”


– A.J. Schumann, Americans United for Separation of Church and State


In “Only Yesterday,” his 1931 chronicle of the 1920s, Frederick Lewis Allen wrote:  “Theoretically, Fundamentalism had won, for the law stood. Yet really Fundamentalism had lost. Legislators might go on passing anti-evolution laws, and in the hinterlands the pious might still keep their religion locked in a science-proof compartment of their minds; but civilized opinion everywhere had regarded the Dayton trial with amazement and amusement, and the slow drift away from Fundamentalist certainty continued.”
Allen and the progressives of his day missed the mark. Donald Trump and his Republican Party owe a big part of their electoral success to white Christian evangelicals of the “God said it. I believe it. That settles it.” persuasion.
Schumann warned that “today’s Christian Nationalist rhetoric echoes the anti-modernist anxieties of the 1920s — fear that secularism is destroying ‘traditional values’ and that public institutions should reflect a ‘Christian America.’”
He wrote that the First Amendment safeguards all Americans “from having any single belief system imposed on them by the state,” a fact that seems to be lost on much of the GOP these days.
Schumann concluded that the Scopes “trial reminds us that the separation of church and state is not something we can take for granted. It is a principle that must be actively defended, especially in moments of cultural anxiety and political division, when calls to return to some mythic past grow loudest.”
Scopes died in 1970 at age 70. He is buried in the family plot in Paducah’s Oak Grove Cemetery next to his wife, Mildred, and close to Lela, who died in 1989 at 92. “A Man of Courage” is his epitaph. A state historical marker at the cemetery’s main entrance tells about him.

Scopes said not a word during the trial. He got his chance at the end.
After the jury delivered the expected guilty verdict and the judge fined Scopes $100, one of his lawyers pointed out that the defendant had been denied the right to speak before sentencing.
“Your Honor, I feel that I have been convicted of violating an unjust statute,” Scopes said. “I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideals of academic freedom, that is to teach the truth as guaranteed in our Constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.”
After Scopes finished, the judge repeated the fine. The verdict was later overturned on a technicality, Schumann wrote, but the Butler Act wasn’t repealed until 1967.

The Supreme Court’s new limits on nationwide injunctions is leading more cities to sue.
Thirty-four cities and counties, including Chicago and Los Angeles, have asked to join a California lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration from cutting federal funding based on sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the administration’s mass deportation agenda.
The expansion of the case could be a sign that more cities are seeing the benefit of suing to protect their rights in court from a Trump administration that is often acting without regard for legal precedent. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that significantly limits nationwide injunctions means that cities and states must be part of a lawsuit to get the benefits of any injunction that would stop such policies while the legal merits are debated in court.
States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

The federal judge in the case, William Orrick of the U.S. District Court of Northern California, did issue an injunction April 24, telling the Trump administration it couldn’t use executive orders to withhold federal funding from the original 15 cities and counties in the lawsuit. Orrick updated the injunction June 23 to include later policy memos tying “all new federal awards” to immigration compliance. The Trump administration said it would appeal the injunction.
“It appears that the defendants continue to seek an end run around the preliminary injunction,” Orrick wrote in June. Orrick left the door open for the administration to withhold funds directly tied to illegal immigration, but he said the administration still must make a case that there’s a real connection between immigration and other issues — especially with seemingly unrelated programs like highway and housing funds.
If the new cities and counties are accepted into the lawsuit, there would be a total of 50 localities in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.










Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.


– Jonathan Miller, attorney for counties and cities suing over funding threats


The Supreme Court decision in Trump v. CASA, limiting nationwide injunctions, now “creates more impetus in this litigation and in others for more parties to seek relief to protect themselves,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
Generally, the local sanctuary policies at stake are those that limit cooperation with “detainers” asking local law enforcement authorities to hold arrested people in jail up to two days after they would otherwise go free, on behalf of federal immigration investigations. Some states and localities limit cooperation with the detainers, and some require cooperation.
“[Trump officials] are taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to getting local governments to do their bidding and this case is pushback against that,” Miller said. “Local governments have authority over their police and aren’t required to participate in immigration enforcement.”
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

In a March filing, attorneys for the Trump administration defended the planned funding cutoffs as part of the president’s Jan. 20 executive order to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’ which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.”
Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, in a response to a reporter’s question that was posted July 8 by the White House, said the administration is determined than ever to go after cities that don’t fully cooperate.
“We’re going to double down and triple down on sanctuary cities. Why? Not because they’re a blue city or a blue state, but because we know that’s where the problem is,” Homan said. “We know they’re releasing public safety threats.”
According to June numbers obtained by the TRAC data clearinghouse at the University of Syracuse, nearly 44% of people held in immigration detention have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses such as traffic violations. The rest were detained based on pending charges or purely immigration-related offenses such as crossing the border in secret.

Nationwide, local governments and authorities own and operate over 31,000 community water systems, providing drinking water to nearly 270 million people.
The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) represents the nation’s largest publicly owned drinking water systems, whose members serve more than 160 million people. Our members exemplify the strength of the public model, delivering safe, affordable, and reliable water while maintaining strong public oversight and reinvesting in critical infrastructure.
From coast to coast, more than 80% of Americans receive their drinking water from public systems, which are embedded in the communities they serve. These public utilities, unlike corporate water utility owners, operate without the pressure of having to deliver shareholder profits, enabling them to focus on long-term planning, sustainability, and affordability. Rates are generally lower than those charged by private counterparts, and decisions are made by elected officials or appointed boards accountable not to shareholders, but to residents.
Public ownership often facilitates operational efficiencies through integration with other municipal services, and enables local leaders to reinvest dollars back into the system for maintenance, upgrades, or programs that support affordability and accessibility.
In addition, public utilities often achieve strong regulatory compliance. For instance, a study in Virginia found that monitoring and reporting violations were 90% more likely in privately owned community water systems than in publicly owned ones.
While AMWA affirms that each community should be empowered to choose the governance model that best meets its needs, we believe that the public ownership model is uniquely equipped to ensure that water systems serve the public interest over the long term. Public water systems are not viewed as assets to be bought or sold but as vital public goods that require stewardship and investment.
In Connecticut, the recent proposal to transition Aquarion Water Company into a publicly owned authority presents an opportunity to reflect on these principles. While AMWA generally refrains from commenting on individual ownership transitions, we support the broader effort to strengthen public water system ownership where it aligns with local goals of transparency, affordability, and sustainability. 
Connecticut already benefits from high-performing public utilities like our member, South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority (RWA), recipient of our Gold, Platinum, and Sustainable utility management awards, denoting demonstrated excellence and leadership through strong performance and innovation in utility management operations. The new publicly owned Aquarion Water Authority would operate in cooperation with the well-established RWA.
AMWA strongly supports these models to show what’s possible when water is managed carefully and responsibly as a public trust.

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital was already navigating a financial shortfall. Now, with the cuts to federal Medicaid funding in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, BMH — and rural hospitals nationwide — are faced with an existential crisis.

This story by Joyce Marcel was first published in The Commons on July 8.
BRATTLEBORO — Much of Windham County depends for its health care services on Brattleboro Memorial Hospital (BMH), which has been weathering what already was a financial crisis.
And then everything changed on July 3, when Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, may cause some 45,000 people in Vermont to lose their health insurance over the next several years, according to initial estimates from the Vermont Agency of Human Services.

And one academic health-care policy study predicts that two other hospitals just over the Vermont state border — one in New Hampshire and the other in Massachusetts — are at risk of closing as a result of the new law.
“I don’t know what to say, except this bill is vicious, and it does, I believe, disproportionately affect rural community hospitals,” said Christopher J. Dougherty, president and CEO of BMH. “And rural community hospitals don’t need any more help to create challenging financial times. It’s there already.”
Rural hospitals mean a great deal to their communities, and BMH is no exception.
“This is not just a hospital,” Dougherty said. “We’re also the largest employer in this community, so we add to the economics of this community.”
And for people looking to move to the Brattleboro region, “they want a hospital close by,” he continued. “They want an emergency room. If they’re of childbearing ages, they want labor and delivery rooms.”
Dougherty believes that rural hospitals “are the bedrocks of rural communities — not just as a hospital, but also really as an economic driver.”
As vital as they may be, America’s rural hospitals are struggling financially. The reasons are complex, but they include everything from the constantly rising costs of health insurance, pharmaceuticals, and staffing to the meager reimbursement the federal government offers for Medicaid and Medicare patient services.
Yet on July 3, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s latest cost estimates, will reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion and increase the number of uninsured people by 7.8 million, according to an analysis from KFF, formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation, which describes itself as an “independent source for health policy research, polling, and news.”
The federal program distributes money to states to administer as benefits for residents who qualify, based on family income or disability status. The funds subsidize some or all medical costs for a variety of needs.
Medicaid dollars don’t go directly into the pockets of individuals. Rather, the program funds initiatives like Dr. Dynasaur, which supports Vermont children from prenatal care for the mother to a child’s teen years. Medicaid covers long-term care, supports people with disabilities, prescription assistance and other programs.
The program has been highly politicized, Dougherty said.
“I don’t think the decisions that are being made are based on facts,” he said. “One of the things that is claimed — and I want to say ‘claimed’ — is that there’s all this fraud in Medicaid, $700 billion worth of fraud. I’m sorry, I don’t believe that’s even possible.”
Proponents of the legislation have “tried to take a narrative that this is all about fraud and waste, but I think it’s all about the most vulnerable among us,” Dougherty said.
Meanwhile, the legislation is not only an attack on them. It’s “also going to destabilize hospitals, especially rural community hospitals,” he observed.
Michael Del Trecco, the president and CEO of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems (VAHHS), told The Commons that the sharp cuts to Medicaid coverage in Vermont would challenge the entire health care system.
“First, it would be very problematic for individuals and their families,” said Del Trecco, whose private, member-owned organization is devoted to “improving the health status of communities throughout Vermont,” according to its website.
“And then, second, generally speaking, there are funding mechanisms in the state that would jeopardize organizations’ abilities to care for and treat people,” Del Trecco continued. “We need to be paid sufficiently to manage our operations while we engage in all of the operational efficiency opportunities that are in front of us. It’s a very difficult, continuous situation.”
Hospitals face ‘strong financial headwinds’
Like most rural hospitals, BMH is already struggling financially; it recently cut six administrative posts as part of an effort to reduce its $119 million annual budget by $4 million without reducing patient services.
Medicaid represents about 20% of BMH’s volume and 15% of its revenue, according to Dougherty.
“We are extremely concerned about the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on BMH for a number of reasons,” Dougherty said.

READ MORE

First, “all Vermont hospitals are already facing very strong financial headwinds,” he explained. “This bill will make massive cuts to Medicaid. It is estimated that Vermont hospitals will lose $1.7 billion in federal health care funding over the next decade.”
BMH will face reduced Medicaid reimbursements, loss of coverage for low-income patients, and an increased uncompensated care burden, he said.
Another complication from the bill is that it would reduce BMH’s provider tax — a $6.6 million burden — by 0.5% each year. While that reduction is welcome, it also means that the state Medicaid program will lose funding from each hospital’s provider tax and the federal matching program for the tax payments.
“This is a substantial amount of funding, and it will have to be made up for somewhere,” he said.
The act does have funds for rural hospitals, clinics, and opioid treatment programs, Dougherty said, but “while these funds will offer the potential for some short-term assistance, the bill does not compensate for the long-term financial damage caused by the Medicaid reductions. This bill exacerbates an already tenuous situation.”
Small hospitals may face staff layoffs, service eliminations and, in the worst cases, complete closure.
Becker’s Hospital Review, a media source for health care decision-makers, estimates that 760 hospitals nationally will be at risk of closure.
It predicts that in Vermont, eight hospitals will be at risk of closing and one is at immediate risk of closing in the next two to three years.
Becker’s reported that across the U.S., 16.1 million people living in rural communities are covered by Medicaid. In nine states, over 50% of the Medicaid population lives in rural communities in Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming, Mississippi, Vermont, Kentucky, North Dakota, Alaska and Maine. Approximately 47% of rural births in the U.S. are covered by Medicaid.
Since approximately 65% of nursing home residents in rural areas are covered by Medicaid, it also makes no sense to say that a Medicaid recipient should just get a job and pay for private insurance.
Yet Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said on May 25 on CBS’s Face the Nation, “If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system.”
According to a letter sent by U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., to Trump, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., “Addressing the crisis in rural health care access is a national, bipartisan priority, and it should be bipartisan to not worsen it. However, if your party passes these health care cuts into law, Americans in rural communities across the country risk losing health care services and jobs supported by their local hospitals.”
Markey appended a detailed list naming all the hospitals he estimates will have to close their doors if and when they lose Medicaid reimbursement, citing an analysis by Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina.
Among them are two nearby hospitals — Baystate Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield, Massachusetts and Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, New Hampshire.
Fighting for survival
According to Owen Foster, the president of the Green Mountain Care Board, which regulates hospital budgets in the state, all Vermont hospitals are fighting for survival in one way or another. He paints a bleak picture.
In most (though not all) of the state’s hospitals, “you have a number of challenges all at the same time, and one is deteriorating hospital finances across the state,” Foster said. “And Brattleboro is one that is facing those challenges right now.”
At the same time, “you also have some of the highest commercial health care costs in the country,” he continued. “And you have no capacity for your patients and your small businesses or your business community to pay more in health care costs. We’ve maxed out our health care costs for our people.”

It’s difficult, he said, for hospital finances to rebound in Vermont with no capacity to increase commercial prices.
“You’ve probably seen the headlines that the commercial insurance costs have been going up [10 to 15%] every single year for the last several years,” Foster said. “Right now, Blue Cross is requesting a 23% rate increase for the individual group insurance market. But people can’t afford to pay 23% more. If people can’t afford to pay 23% more, they can’t afford to pay BMH higher prices to solve the financial challenges they have.”
In addition, the coming federal changes to Medicaid will have a large impact.
“If you have uninsured people, it often results in bad debt or free care,” Foster said. “And the subsidies for the qualified health plans change, which could also limit the number of people on commercial insurance.”
Even before the bill, Blue Cross Blue Shield has been threatening bankruptcy.
“The insurer finances are probably more challenged and strained right now than any hospital financials,” Foster said. “Blue Cross Blue Shield has been put under incredible financial stress in the last year. Their reserves have been significantly depleted, so they have no money to pay out, either. And that’s a challenge. There’s really nowhere to get more money.”
All these things combine to put a significant strain on hospital finances, Foster said.
“So the long and short of it is there’s really no horizon that we see where there’s a significant financial injection to solve for the financial challenges people have,” he said.
Cutting costs
Dougherty took on the job of running BMH three years ago. According to Foster, he is the right man for the job.
“Brattleboro has had a tough year,” Foster said. “There’s no question about it. But I’m not alarmed, more than I am for any other number of hospitals in Vermont that have challenging financials.
“Part of it is that I’m very supportive of the work that Chris Dougherty is doing. And I think it’s done with the greatest of intention to make sure that Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is there to serve the community in the years ahead. They’re taking a lot of really important steps to try and address their challenges.”
Del Trecco, of the VAHHS, said Dougherty is dedicated to making sure BMH is “there today and in the future” and believes in budget-cutting and looking for operational efficiencies both in clinical and nonclinical services.
“The work is not easy and often communities can be concerned, as they rightly should be,” he continued. “But we need to make sure we do this work together. For Chris and his team, the goal was to make sure BMH is viable and there for years to come, and I think he’s doing a really great job.”
Two terrible things can happen to hospitals, Dougherty said, and one of them has already happened to BMH: staff cuts.
Dougherty said it was painful to cut the six administrative positions, putting “great people” out of a job.
“It’s not something we’re proud of,” he said. “It’s not something we’re excited about. We’re really sad about any type of layoff.”
The other terrible thing would be closing all or a part of the hospital. Copley Hospital in Morrisville is closing its birthing center because of unsustainable long-term costs and declining birth rates across the region, he said.
“We’re saying we’re not going to do something like that,” Dougherty said. “I’ve got to tell you, we’re fighting to say ‘We can’t go that route.’ We’ve got to do everything up to the point of eliminating a service. It would be devastating to this community to eliminate any of our services. So we’re looking at everything else possible short of that.
“Closure, in our mind, is absolutely not an option, and everything needs to be done to reinvent, because there’s always a fork in the road; it’s either closure or reinvention,” he continued.
As an example, Dougherty cited Blockbuster Video, which had almost 9,100 locations in 2004. After the rise of streaming video and a string of corporate bankruptcies over the years, all that remains is one lone independently owned franchise in Oregon.
“They didn’t change who they were and what they were doing, and they ended up closing,” Dougherty said. “In contrast, if you look at Netflix, they started out by just emailing DVDs. And look at what they’ve done. They’ve revolutionized streaming and things like that, because they reinvented themselves.
“This is what we’re doing. Unfortunately, some of that reinvention is painful. We have to become more cost efficient and more streamlined, and that’s where those layoffs came to be,” he continued.
Everyone deserves treatment
Vermont law states that hospitals have to serve everyone who “walks in the door,” Dougherty said. That means treating people who have insurance as well as people who don’t.
And BMH would do that even without the law, according to Dougherty. But add a flood of now-uninsured former Medicaid patients to those already walking in the door of the Emergency Department, and the finances get tricky.
“Somebody has to pay for it,” Dougherty said. “The question is who. […] Well, if it’s the hospitals, we’re struggling already. We don’t need any help to struggle more. We need help in getting out of this. [The One Big Beautiful Bill Act] doesn’t help us get out of this.”
Until July 1, BMH contracted with Cheshire Medical Center, which “has been staffing our emergency room and doing a tremendous job for quite some time,” Dougherty said. “They have decided that they can no longer extend that coverage to us.” A new provider, BlueWater Health, of Maine, has taken over.
Emergency department staff already live and work in the BMH area, but they now work for BlueWater instead of Cheshire.
Sometimes, the department has more patients than it can safely handle.
“This last week, we’ve been in what is called a surge mode,” Dougherty said, meaning that patients in the emergency department exceeded the number of rooms.
“So it’s not necessarily a staffing problem. Part of the problem is the flow of patients. Last week, for example, we were having days with eight to 10 mental health patients that we couldn’t move out of the emergency room. It wasn’t safe for them to just be discharged home,” he said.
“So then trying to find the right place for them to go to is a problem, not just at BMH, but in every hospital. We’re not mental health experts. We can’t do a whole lot for them, but there was nowhere else for them to go.
On a recent morning, “we were close to being at surge, but we had some patients who could get to long-term care facilities, or even admitted to our hospital,” Dougherty said.
The future
What the area lacks most is primary care, but a private practice is expensive to open and to operate. Dougherty said that BMH is working to expand primary care in the county.
“There’s a federal program that Sen. Bernie Sanders is incredibly supportive of, and it’s called the Federally Qualified Health Center system,” Dougherty said. “There are several around. Actually, every county in Vermont has a federally qualified health center except Windham County.”
Before Dougherty arrived in 2022, Sanders got “some congressionally designated funds to build a federally qualified health center in Windham County. He wants a Federally Qualified Health center in every county in Vermont. So we’re embracing that.”
Hospitals cannot be federally qualified health centers, which provide primary care, dental care and outpatient mental health care.
“So the closest one in Vermont is in Springfield,” Dougherty said. “There’s also a close one in Massachusetts [in Greenfield]. We’re hoping one of them will actually work with us to build a federally qualified health center here and provide those three key things that we need desperately in this community.”
The beauty of the federally qualified health centers is that they focus on taking care of Medicaid patients and uninsured patients first and foremost.
“So everybody has access to primary care, dental care, and outpatient mental health services,” Dougherty said.
“We’re also working with the Brattleboro Retreat to provide the outpatient mental health services,” he continued. “Our hope is that maybe as soon as January, we will actually have a federally qualified health center here at Brattleboro. It may be on campus. It may be in three separate sites.”
No single ‘magic tactic’
In response to the potential of a significant federal cutback in Medicaid, the state has been looking for ways to enhance the Medicaid program, Dougherty said.
“Let’s give a little credit to the state,” Dougherty said. “The state is actually looking at ways of enhancing the Medicaid program, I think because of these concerns of what’s happening with federal dollars.”
The Green Mountain Care Board and the Agency of Human Services are exploring a hospital global budgeting payment for 2026, which will transition hospitals from fee-for-service to a fixed amount to cover a defined set of services. Dougherty said that BMH is “evaluating this.”
“It may be this is a good way to approach Medicaid and to prepare us for the future of the way health care is going to be reimbursed,” he said.
“We met with them once to talk about their hospital global budgeting program for Medicaid. We have until October to volunteer to be in that program come Jan. 1. And we may very well want to do that,” said Dougherty, who called it a “win-win.”
“It would be good for the state because it gives them a very specific way of administering the Medicaid program. But it may also be good for us and our community, because it gives us sort of a fixed income for our Medicaid patients,” said Dougherty, adding that the program could become mandatory by 2030.
Dougherty said he also had “about 40 other tactics” he was exploring to cut costs and reduce his budget.
“I wish I could tell you there was one magic tactic that gets us right to where we want to be, but there isn’t,” he said. “So we’re trying everything. And some are small and some are large. Some have no impact on staff, basically, and some have.”
What BMH desperately wants to do is avoid cutting any medical services.
“We don’t want that to happen,” Dougherty said.
According to Foster at the Green Mountain Care Board, there is enough money in the health care system to provide a high-caliber, high-quality system.
“The problem is that we have a system that doesn’t work well and doesn’t function well,” he said. “We don’t have many low-cost providers in the state, and we need to make sure that we have those available. Those are often small practices. They are primary care practices, independent practices, generally. Those are the most expensive places to provide care.
“Vermont, as compared to other states, has overwhelmingly concentrated our care at hospitals. And that’s not a recipe for sustainability.”
The state needs more telemedicine, Foster said. It needs to consolidate some services. It needs to reduce discretionary spending. It needs to encourage and support smaller, more affordable practices.
Closing BMH ‘not an option’
Could BMH go under?
“I dearly hope not,” Foster said. “There are some really good people there and some really good providers, and they’re really important to the community.”
Foster said that “a lot of Vermont’s challenges are things that we’ve seen across the country. There have been rural hospital closures by the hundreds across the nation. We’ve had no hospital closures in Vermont.”
“Rural hospital markets have been decimated across the country. In Vermont, we have not yet had that,” he continued. “A big part of it is a lot of people working really hard, but also the commercial market subsidizing prices.”
He added that “there’s always risk to any small rural hospital in America, and Vermont is certainly not immune to that, especially given the potential federal changes and the realities at Blue Cross Blue Shield, and with our people’s inability to pay more in health care costs.”
For Dougherty, closing BMH is not an option.
“BMH is fighting,” he said. “We actually do need to be a less expensive hospital than we are. And we are going to do everything necessary to keep this treasured resource in this community.”
Dougherty said that hospital leadership knows “that some of those things are going to be painful, and we’ve started on some of those things that are painful, like reductions in force. But I do believe there are some things that really are very much glimmers of hope.”
One glimmer of hope is new revenue enhancement, and Dougherty points to BMH’s new, faster magnetic resonance imaging machine to replace a 17-year-old device that “was way beyond years of obsolescence.”
“We invested in that MRI because it generates a revenue for us,” he said. “This new MRI is a good thing for our community.”
“We are trying to think way out of the box and try and find other revenue streams,” Dougherty said. “There has to be hope.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Skeptical Arkansas lawmakers seemed unwilling to accept Thursday that the escape of a convicted murderer and rapist was the fault of only two prison employees. 
Members of the Charitable, Penal, and Correctional Institutions subcommittee grilled corrections officials and Arkansas State Police leaders for more than three hours about the May 25 escape of Grant Hardin, who was serving nearly 80 years at the North Central Unit at Calico Rock.
Hardin, 56, had no disciplinary record and was working in the prison kitchen at the time of his escape on a Sunday during inmate visitation hours. The kitchen employee responsible for supervising prisoners allowed Hardin to go onto the facility’s rear loading dock unsupervised, in violation of prison policy, Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness told the panel.

Calico Rock Warden Thomas Hurst told legislators that Hardin, disguised in a makeshift guard uniform, was on the dock for more than an hour before the inmate walked to the prison’s sally port, where a guard in a tower let him through without verifying his identity or challenging him — also a policy violation. A sally port is a secure entry-exit with two gates that are not supposed to open at the same time.
“If any one of them had said ‘no,’ Mr. Hardin wouldn’t have got out,” Magness told the Arkansas Legislative Council subcommittee.
Prison employees had recently been updated on those policies and specifically told not to let inmates onto the loading dock without supervision. The kitchen supervisor was busy at the time, but should have called his supervisor and asked to have someone sent to watch over Hardin, Hurst and Magness said.
Both employees have been dismissed, but had not been interviewed beyond being asked how they let Hardin escape, Hurst said.
Rep. Ryan Rose, R-Van Buren, found it incredulous that no one has interviewed the two individuals or tried to determine whether other inmates had been allowed to remain unsupervised on the dock or others allowed to go through the gate without being challenged.
Other lawmakers questioned Magness, Hurst and Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne about whether the policy violations were endemic.
Hurst replied that the employees simply became complacent and that prison officials are working on keeping staff vigilant. He also said prison policy has changed to ensure no inmates are allowed onto the loading dock.

Magness said prison officials are also looking at installing some sort of electronic system that would alert a higher ranking officer whenever the gates are opened.
Subcommittee chairman Sen. Matt Mckee, R-Pearcy, said the problems go beyond complacency and likely extend to how the Corrections Department classifies prisoners for placement.
McKee and other lawmakers focused on whether Hardin should have been serving his sentence in a more secure prison. Calico Rock is a medium-security prison but does house some more serious felons.
“You misclassified him on the murder, and his reclassification after the rape wasn’t communicated to the prison. He shouldn’t have been in that facility. I think we’ve got major issues I think need to be dealt with,” McKee told Magness.
Before his 2017 murder conviction, Hardin had been a police officer in the 1990s, an elected constable in Benton County and police chief of Gateway, a small town on the Missouri stateline, in 2016. He was working as a guard in a women’s prison in Northwest Arkansas in 2017 when he was arrested for shooting and killing a man in Gateway. He was sentenced to 30 years for the killing.
After he pleaded guilty to that murder, Hardin’s DNA was linked to a 20-year-old cold case from Benton County: the rape of a teacher at a Rogers elementary school in November 1997. Hardin pleaded guilty to two counts of rape in 2019, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported at the time, and was sentenced to another 50 years in prison.
Hardin’s escape drew national attention, partly because he was the subject of a television documentary, “Devil in the Ozarks.” 
Law enforcement officers captured Hardin on June 6 in a forested area less than two miles from the prison. He is now being held in the Varner Supermax Unit near Gould.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250710_Thomas-Hurst-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 23:01:40.018566

(Photo by  Kentaro Yasui/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)A federal judge has upheld the National Marine Fisheries Service’s new system to manage commercial harvests in federal waters of Cook Inlet, concluding that the agency has no obligation to extend that management to state waters.
The July 1 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason lets stand a split federal-state management regime for commercial salmon harvests in Cook Inlet, the marine waters by Alaska’s most heavily populated region.
The ruling is a win for the NMFS, an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and a loss for fishers who sought federal management of all Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvests because they were dissatisfied with state management.
NMFS had previously deferred all Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvest management to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
The new split management system, with the state in charge of harvests in nearshore waters and NMFS in charge of harvests in waters beyond 3 nautical miles offshore, is the result of a series of lawsuits filed since 2009 by United Cook Inlet Drift Association. The association represents about 500 fishers who harvest salmon with drift gillnets, a type of net gear that is pulled by vessels.
In 2016, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in UCIDA’s favor, triggering the NMFS management takeover in Cook Inlet’s federal waters. Gleason’s ruling came in the most recent lawsuit in the matter, which UCIDA filed last year. That lawsuit accused NMFS of shirking its management duties by not extending its control to all Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvesting and instead, continuing to defer too much to the state.
UCIDA has argued for years that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has mismanaged Cook Inlet salmon harvests, resulting in what the organization has described in legal documents as “significant under-harvest.” Starting in about 2000, UCIDA said in a brief filed on Nov. 6, state management “took a turn for the worse, and salmon harvest in Cook Inlet began a precipitous and lasting decline that has now persisted for almost 25 years, to the detriment of fishing communities throughout Cook Inlet.”
But NMFS has long disputed the claim that state mismanagement has resulted in under-harvest of salmon. “There has never been credible scientific support for the idea that the drift gill net fleet could meaningfully increase its harvest without harming the more vulnerable stocks in Cook Inlet,” said a Dec. 20 brief filed by the agency.
The state intervened in the case on behalf of NMFS, and Alaska Attorney General Treg Tayor welcomed Gleason’s ruling. It was “a victory for Alaska and our salmon fishery,” Taylor said in a statement. “It upheld the state’s rights and responsibilities to managing our waters.”
NMFS last month set this year’s harvest limits for Cook Inlet’s federal waters. Under those limits, there is an allowable catch of 800,126 sockeye salmon and about 147,000 salmon of other species.
The total Cook Inlet commercial salmon harvest in 2024 was about 2.3 million fish, the vast majority of which was sockeye, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

It took two years to convert the vessel and will return to service on the Seattle-Bainbridge route next week.(Photo by Tom Banse)Washington’s first plug-in ferry will begin shuttling cars and passengers across Puget Sound by the end of next week. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson made the announcement Thursday during a celebratory demonstration lap around Elliot Bay on the ferry Wenatchee, concluding a challenging conversion to hybrid-electric propulsion over the past 22 months.
Ferguson walked on board with his predecessor, Jay Inslee, who appeared in a particularly good mood. Inslee championed the electrification and decarbonization plans of the state ferry system during his three terms as governor. The debut of the overhauled Wenatchee is the first tangible result that taxpayers and commuters can ride.
“Washington state is a great visionary state. It deserves a great visionary boat and it has got one today,” Inslee exulted.
Ferguson joked that he wondered whether it would be possible to rename the Wenatchee as the Inslee. Washington’s former chief executive responded that it would be better to rename it the Trudi, for the former first lady who was standing nearby and has been his most trusted adviser.
Amid the friendly banter, no one mentioned that superstitious mariners consider it bad luck to rename a vessel.
When the Wenatchee returns to service, it will ply the Seattle-Bainbridge route, which has the highest ridership at Washington State Ferries. It will run part-time in the evenings to ease in, returning to full-time service by the end of the month. Ferguson said the 202-car ferry now takes the crown as the largest hybrid-electric ferry in North America.
A little less vibration and a little quieter
As the Wenatchee set sail from downtown Seattle on a short figure-eight loop around the bay, passengers noted a little less of the usual rumble while getting underway. Later, the captain steered the vessel on battery power alone for a spell.
“When we’re going along at service speed and we’re on pure electric, it’s noticeably quieter in the cabin,” Captain Robert Merideth said in an interview. “On the car deck not so much because of the noise of the boat going through the water.” 
“It’s wonderful to drive,” Merideth added from the wheelhouse. “We have to look to the future.”
  Washington State Ferries Captain Robert Merideth said the newly electrified ferry Wenatchee offers passengers a quieter ride. (Photo by Tom Banse)
The main reason the state spent $133 million on the hybrid-electric conversion and other mid-life refurbishment was to save fuel and reduce air pollution. On that score, the climate friendliness will initially be constrained by the lack of any place to plug in the Wenatchee to recharge its massive battery packs.
The complicated shore power infrastructure is in the design phase for the downtown Seattle, Bainbridge, Bremerton, Kingston and Clinton terminals. The Seattle terminal’s plug-in charging arm and power supply will probably be completed first, but not before 2029, according to a presentation to the state House Transportation Committee on Tuesday.
During the Wenatchee’s conversion to battery-powered propulsion, shipyard workers removed two locomotive-sized diesel engines. They kept two diesel-driven electric generators to supply backup power for when the batteries run low. The ultimate goal is to operate purely electric most of the time. But for the next few years, those diesel generators are the full-time source of power for all of the boat’s systems.
“We anticipate saving 25% on the fuel just running in hybrid mode on this boat until we can start charging” from shore, Washington State Ferries chief Steve Nevey told reporters on board Tuesday.
Nevey said the revampe9od ferry’s powertrain works somewhat akin to a plug-in hybrid Prius. In the engine room, staff chief engineer Terry Chen called up an on-screen display that showed the direction of the electron flow between the batteries and the motors that Prius drivers might recognize from their own car dashboard displays. The updated ferry will get an efficiency boost by recapturing energy, not from regenerative braking as in a car but from the boat motor shedding load when the captain pulls back the throttle.
WSF said the battery banks in the engine room below the car deck are equipped with water mist fire suppression systems and advanced safety monitoring features. The batteries themselves are said to be fire resistant and have “emergency stop circuits,” according to a handout.
Will there be more ferry conversions?
The overhaul of the vintage 1998 Wenatchee took nearly twice as long as planned and ran far over the original budget. WSF Electrification Program Administrator David Sowers told state lawmakers on Tuesday that it has been “a very long and difficult project for us.”
“There were things about the vessel that weren’t fully captured in the design drawings,” Sowers explained. “It’s like an old house. As you open up the walls, you find things that you didn’t expect, and you have to make changes to the contract.”
WSF owns two other ferries of the same Jumbo Mark II class, the Tacoma and the Puyallup. Sowers said he anticipates it would cost significantly less to convert the Wenatchee’s sister ships to hybrid electric propulsion given all the lessons learned over the past two years.

Whether the Wenatchee is a one-off or the first in a series of diesel to hybrid-electric conversions as envisioned by Inslee remains an open question. 
In March, Ferguson pressed pause on planned conversions of the Tacoma and Puyallup in order to keep as many ferries in the water as possible and speed up the restoration of pre-pandemic service levels. On Thursday, Ferguson said his thinking about this has not changed; he’ll reevaluate conversion plans after the surge of visitors anticipated to descend on Western Washington for soccer’s 2026 World Cup abates.
“I’m very proud to be here standing on the first hybrid electric vessel in Washington state’s ferry fleet,” Ferguson said. “The good news is it certainly won’t be the last.”
That remark left a smile on Inslee’s face, but it was an easy pledge for Ferguson to make because the state recently ordered three brand new 160-car hybrid electric ferries from a Florida shipyard. The first of the ferries is expected to be delivered around 2030.

(Photo: John Partipilo)In May Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell wrapped up his 2025 State of Metro address with a call for Nashvillians to “give ourselves some more choices about how we move into our future together.” 
Let’s grant off the top that political State of The Whatever speeches inevitably amount to ritually upbeat exercises in civic fantasy with a news making shelf life of about an hour. But parking the cynicism for a few minutes (a heavy lift for me) I found myself chewing on hizzoner’s yen for a promising future as I scanned recent news items on the city’s economic trajectory:

A story chronicling how Nashville over the last decade has parlayed its Music City branding into an unstoppable tourism growth juggernaut that “catapulted us to where we are today,” according to the head of the city’s Chamber of Commerce. 
News that aggressive development of tall gleaming apartment buildings has gifted (some might say saddled) the city center with a large inventory (some might say glut) of unrented tall-gleaming-apartment-building apartments, with vacancies said to number in the thousands. 
Word that the design of a new boulevard down the heart of the Cumberland River’s East Bank may turn out to be just another six-lane car-centric pike rather than the multimodal transit dreamscape we were invited to imagine when the East Bank vision thing went down three years ago. 
Numbers showing that Nashville’s downtown office vacancy rate well exceeds the national average, with many of the city’s largest non-government buildings losing significant value.
Reporting that the downtown convention center is pondering a massive expansion because, according to Music City Center CEO Charles Starks, “we simply don’t have the space to accommodate every group, and we’re turning away business daily.”

Taken together the picture these and similar dispatches paint is a paradoxical one: a city that manages to be simultaneously vibrant and stagnant. There’s a lot going on, yet it somehow feels like Nashville is  running in place. 
To be sure, indicators of economic vim abound: rising population with job growth to match, relentless tourism, low unemployment, new hotels, pricey apartments, added BNA destinations, and let’s not forget expanding options for hot chicken and (finally!) good Italian. It all makes for an impressive array of signals of a certain kind of urban vitality, but these are markers of growth itself, not necessarily development or advancement (except maybe the good Italian part).

Growth doesn’t automatically make a city a better place, and it certainly doesn’t by itself spark us to “move into the future together.” I’ll admit that’s a pretty pedestrian observation, but apparently not pedestrian enough to penetrate the collective crania of the forces driving economic Nashville. If music is Nashville’s cultural house of worship, growth for the sake of growth is its civic religion, propelled by its lead divine commandment: more is better.
This may have made some sense ten or fifteen years ago, as outside attention to Nashville’s blossoming cosmopolitanism grew and the city began to imagine itself flourishing into something that might rate the adjective world-class. But taken to extremes, more-is-better means a shortage of forward-looking adults in the room ready to tap the brakes when the thing spins out. 
That spin has produced for us the opposite of world class: a city center that is principally a lucrative theme park of intoxication in which corporate operators profit off synthetic music celebrity branding, culinary mediocrity, and exploitation of talented musicians hustling for a subsistence living as country-rock human jukeboxes. 
It is also a downtown that many Nashvillians want little to do with. The same apparently can be said about business. The concerning downtown office vacancy rate I mentioned above isn’t just an artifact of post-Covid hybrid work; it’s in part due to some enterprises choosing to escape the theme park and relocate outside the heart of downtown. 
We have, quite simply, lost control of our downtown, with no relief in sight: the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp’s strategic plan gleefully projects significant growth in visitor spend and hotel occupancy through the mid-2030s. Those who profit off of it will inevitably insist that given how taxation works around here, a theme-park downtown is the price we must pay to fund everything else. 
My rejoinder: a city without an active core that can commercially and culturally engage both locals and visitors is an uninteresting city, and a theme park for inebriated visitors doesn’t qualify. The idea that untamed growth makes all the other good stuff possible would be more compelling if we had more to show for what we have let tourism become over the last 15 years beyond incremental improvements in generally mediocre regimes of education, transportation, and attainable housing.
I don’t want to suggest there has been an absence of forward-looking thinking in and about the city. Last year’s Imagine Nashville project, self-described as a “community-led process to unify the city around a set of priorities and actions to guide Nashville over the next decade,” is an ambitious example. Its final report—subtitled “A Vision for Nashville’s Future”— offered a large array of goals, metrics, and action ideas in four buckets: standards of living, transit, housing, and neighborhood quality of life. It’s a strong document, but their ambit apparently didn’t include much attention to the city’s commercial and geographic center. 
 
It has become fashionable to put untethered growth on notice. “Growth brings mostly benefits and advantages if it is more carefully managed,” reads the Imagine Nashville report. The challenge is to grow “in a smart way … showing duty of care of the city and that we want to protect it,” says Convention and Visitors Corp CEO Deana Ivey.
Charming thoughts but it’s all lip service, and it’s getting old. Many look around downtown Nashville and think: Well, better this than the hollow shell of commercial decay it was thirty years ago. That’s not an insane position. But you can also look around and ask: Who did this to us and how do we make it stop? And by the way does anyone seriously think that doubling the size of the Music City Center and building more hotels so we can stuff more conventioneers and bachelorettes into more cookie-cutter celebrity bars is the answer?

A new local journalism report from Rebuild Local News and Muck Rack reveals a 75% decline in local journalists across the country since 2002. 
“The goals of this new report and project is to try to create a measure of journalists per population and an index that could be recreated each year down to the county level,” Rebuild Local Journalism Founder Steve Waldman said during a webinar Thursday. “The reason that we all felt that that was important is that at the heart of the local news crisis is the lack of coverage and the lack of reporters in communities.”
The report, which was released Thursday, found that the shortage of local journalists is both severe and widespread. This shortage is measured by a new metric called Local Journalist Equivalents (LJEs), which uses a formula to evaluate the strength of local journalism. LJEs were determined by outlet types, verifiable bylines and reporting capacity based on factors like publishing frequency. This data was then used to show nationwide trends and state specific metrics.
In 2002, there was a national average of about 40 local journalists per 100,000 people. Today, that figure has dropped to an average of 8.2 Local Journalist Equivalents. Georgia’s average currently sits well below that number, landing Georgia at No. 46 on this year’s ranking.
With a statewide population of 11 million people, Georgia has an average of 5.8 Local Journalist Equivalents per 100,000 people. This average was significantly less than the No. 1 ranked state of Vermont that has an average of 27.5. Nevada trailed four places behind Georgia with the lowest ranked average of 4.8 local journalists.
While the decline of local news is not a new phenomenon, the report confirms that rural areas are not the only communities underserved by local news. Many fast growing areas including Los Angeles and Las Vegas also scored below the national average.
Richard T. Griffiths, a retired reporter and president emeritus of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said continued decline of local journalism goes beyond local journalists.
“It’s not the industry that is the future casualty of this, it’s democracy itself,” Griffiths said. “If you have a populace that doesn’t understand what’s going on in its community because there are no reporters able to go to the meetings to figure out what’s going on, then you have a collapse of the institutions that underpin our society and our democracy.”
Griffiths cited waning advertising dollars and the rise of social media as notable factors behind the demise of local news. In a world of subscriptions and paywalls, Griffiths said he believes that the business model of local journalism needs to be re-evaluated. He points to nonprofit models like The Current on the Georgia coast and The Macon Melody as potential ways to revitalize local news.
While the new report may not identify clear-cut solutions, the creators behind the report hope their findings can help improve the viability and sustainability of local journalism.
“We think we made a real significant contribution here, and that this really gives a very meaningful picture of the sort of journalistic horsepower in counties across America and will help all of us to better understand both the crisis and how to solve it,” Waldman said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office charged two people this week in the first child torture case since lawmakers passed a bill inspired in part by social media influencer and convicted child abuser Ruby Franke. 
Tyrel Scott Belone and Amber Lee Leary were both charged on Tuesday with attempted aggravated murder, aggravated child abuse and child torture, all first-degree felonies. 
It’s the second time child torture charges have been filed in Utah, the state judiciary confirmed on Thursday, and the first case since the new law took effect on May 7. In late May, prosecutors in 7th District Court in Castle Dale filed an amended complaint charging Timothy James Soots and Jesica Lynn Stoops with the new crime. However, the initial charges were filed in December 2024, in a crime that allegedly occurred in May 2023. 
Lawmakers want to stiffen penalties for child abuse cases so severe they can be called ‘torture’

This week’s charges stem from SB24, a bill sponsored by Sen. Don Ipson, R-St. George, that passed with broad support earlier this year, receiving one “no” vote in the Senate and two in the House. The bill was partly inspired by a notorious case of child abuse in Ipson’s district involving Franke and her associate, Jodi Hildebrandt. 
Franke was a popular family vlogger whose YouTube channel, 8 Passengers, had nearly 2.5 million followers. Allegations of child abuse dogged Franke and in September 2023, she was arrested after her 12-year-old malnourished child ran to a neighbor’s door asking for help.
The child, who escaped from Hildebrandt’s home, had “open wounds and duct tape around” their extremities, according to a police report. Police then found Franke’s 10-year-old child in Hildebrandt’s home, also malnourished. 
Both Franke and Hildebrandt were sentenced to four one-to-15 year prison terms for child abuse.
Previously, if a child died from abuse in Utah, prosecutors could pursue stiff charges, including homicide. When they survive, “there is nothing that adequately addresses what happens to these children,” said Eric Clarke, the Washington County attorney whose office prosecuted Franke and Hildebrandt, speaking to lawmakers last year. 
SB24 created a new criminal penalty called child torture, defined as “a serious injury that is inflicted in an exceptionally cruel or exceptionally depraved manner that causes the child to experience extreme physical or psychological pain or anguish.” It can also include conduct that takes place “over a prolonged period of time.” The law requires a 10-year minimum prison sentence, in most cases.

The law is aimed at the worst cases of child abuse — during the legislative session, one advocate described it as being a “POW in your own home.” 
And according to Salt Lake District Attorney Sim Gill, the alleged abuse from Belone and Leary meets the high bar now outlined in state code. 
According to court documents, Sandy police responded to a reported assault on June 28 involving a 3-year-old child. When officers found the child, she was unconscious and was covered in bruises. 
After speaking with both Leary and Belone, detectives confirmed multiple instances of child abuse, according to the charges. Belone told officers he threw the child on the bed, where she hit the wall with her face; he admitted to spanking and using an open hand to strike her face; he said he hit her with a closed fist and slapped her in the bathroom, causing her to fall. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I have knocked her a couple times,” Belone told officers, according to court documents. 
Prosecutors described the girl being so bruised after being alone with Belone that her eyes were swollen shut, leading Leary to keep her in the house where she wouldn’t be seen for several days.
Leary was in the bedroom during at least one of Belone’s alleged attacks, and charges state that she “has never physically gotten between him” and the child. 
Prosecutors say that as the child was injured and unresponsive, Belone wouldn’t let Leary call police, telling her, “If you call, I’ll go to jail, you don’t have any money, you don’t have any friends.” Leary then told Belone she needed to have a smoke, and stepped outside and called 911. 
“If you are a parent who is struggling with your children, please ask for help from friends or family or outside organizations that can help you. As parents, we are meant to protect and raise our children in a healthy environment where they can flourish,” said Gill in a statement. “We appreciate the thorough investigation done by Sandy Police Department that helped lead to these charges being filed. All persons accused of wrongdoing are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/010324_Salt-Lake-County-District-Attorney_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 21:08:25.841988

Blacklegged ticks now account for 99% of reported tick bite illnesses in Vermont, and more than half tested carry Lyme disease.

Invasive plants, new housing development and climate change are boosting tick populations in Vermont, officials say, prompting new concerns about diseases the tiny insects carry. 
Although ticks have been present for a long time in Vermont, the population has grown substantially, said Patti Casey, environmental surveillance program director for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets.
The blacklegged tick, or deer tick, is the type most frequently spotted in the state and responsible for 99% of the tick bite illnesses reported to the Vermont Department of Health.
“We are a high-incidence state for several blacklegged tick-driven tick-borne diseases,” said Natalie Kwit, public health veterinarian for the state Department of Health. “For Lyme disease, we have had over 1,000 cases in 2023.”
According to the 2018-22 Tick Pathogen Surveillance Report by the Department of Health, more than half of the blacklegged ticks analyzed carry Lyme disease, an infection that can be transmitted to humans and cause symptoms like fever, fatigue, headache, skin rash, and if left untreated can affect heart, joints, and the nervous system. In Vermont, Chittenden, Windsor and Rutland counties had the highest prevalence of blacklegged ticks infected with the disease.

Ticks can be found any time of the year when the temperature is above freezing, with their peak activity being in May and June and then again in October and November. Ticks survive by biting their host for blood, which leads to the transmission of diseases.
Other tick bite illnesses recorded in Vermont are anaplasmosis, babesiosis, hard tick relapsing fever, and Powassan virus disease, which is very rare.
Since 2015, Vermont has had the nation’s highest annual number of cases of anaplasmosis. Symptoms are similar to those of Lyme disease except for the skin rash. The most common effects are fever, muscle aches, chills, malaise and headaches, but the disease can also cause people to develop anemia, low white blood cell counts, low platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes. The illness can have serious consequences if not treated, especially for old patients or people with health problems.
The American dog tick, brown dog tick, squirrel tick and woodchuck tick are other common ticks found in Vermont. The lone star tick, which carries alpha-gal syndrome, an illness that leads to the development of a red meat allergy, is not fully established in Vermont.
“We’re not seeing any of the lone star tick-driven tick-borne diseases in Vermont in humans, so we’re pretty confident that they’re not here, but it doesn’t mean that they can’t geographically expand to be in Vermont in the future,” Kwit said.
To prevent tick bites, Casey suggests wearing long pants tucked into socks and long-sleeve shirts when spending time outdoors in areas where ticks prosper to spot ticks more easily if they end up on clothes. Spraying EPA-registered repellents or treating clothes with permethrin is also recommended to keep ticks away.
Once home, it’s advisable to put the clothes in the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill potential ticks and take a shower, checking the body and scalp to spot bumps. 
In case there is a tick, it should be removed quickly using tweezers, grabbing the tick as close as possible to the skin surface and pulling upward steadily, and then cleaning the area with rubbing alcohol, soap and water. The Vermont Department of Health provides detailed guidelines on how to remove ticks.
The Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets allows people to send ticks to be identified. The agency doesn’t test the ticks for diseases, but it will inform people of the species, sex and age of the tick, giving them information they can tell their doctor to assess the best course of treatment in case they later develop symptoms.
Since many people don’t realize they have been bitten by a tick, experts recommend being on the lookout for potential symptoms, especially after outdoor activities.
The agency also conducts a tick surveillance program in collaboration with the Vermont Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, collecting ticks across Vermont to test them and gather data on tick species, their habitats and the diseases they may carry. 
Casey said the program has been temporarily suspended this year due to uncertainty surrounding funding. The priority has instead shifted to mosquito surveillance to track illnesses such as Eastern equine encephalitis.
“Most of us live in Vermont, in part, because it’s so beautiful, and we like to be outdoors in it. And it’s just that things have changed a little bit, and now we need to be very vigilant about interactions with ticks to try to avoid tick bites,” Casey said. “The good news is that if we’re careful, we can really drastically lower our risk for contracting a tick-borne illness.”

(U.S. Geological Survey photo)A small creek on Alaska’s Little Kiska Island has been renamed, more than 80 years after it was named after Germany’s Nazi Party by World War II soldiers fighting in the Aleutians.
Nazi Creek was the last landmark in the United States to bear the Nazi name. Its new name is “Kaxchim Chiĝanaa,” meaning either “gizzard creek” or “creek or river belonging to gizzard island” in Unangam Tunuu, the language of the Indigenous Unangax̂ people. 
On Thursday, the Domestic Names Committee of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names voted 17-0 to approve the new name, without discussion.
The board’s decision allows the federal government to officially change the creek’s name in federal databases that are the official repository of geographic names. That repository is used by federal agencies and commercial companies that provide maps to the general public.
The board also approved the renaming of nearby “Nip Hill,” named by soldiers using a derogatory term for Japanese people. That hill was renamed “Kaxchim Qayaa,” or “gizzard hill,” again using the traditional name for Little Kiska Island, which is not far from Kiska Island, site of a World War II battle.
Michael Livingston, an employee of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, has been working for almost two years to have the names changed. Moses Dirks, an expert on Unangam Tunuu, recommended the new names.
“I think that’s pretty awesome. I think elders … and others are happy about it. It really should have never been there in the first place,” Livingston said of Thursday’s vote.
“Like one of my teachers … used to say, if you know something that can make our community better, our villages better, be brave and stand up and say something about it, do something about it,” Livingston said. 
The new names were previously recommended by the Alaska Historical Commission, which considered them in April. The changes were endorsed by local Native tribes and Native corporations, the Museum of the Aleutians, the manager of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, Congregation Beth Sholom of Anchorage, and the Alaska Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League, among others.
Kiska Island is located 242 miles west of Adak, at the far end of the Aleutian Islands. The area has been mostly uninhabited since World War II, when invading Japanese forces took 42 people on Attu Island prisoner. More than half died in Japanese internment camps.
The United States forcibly relocated almost 900 Unangax̂ residents of the Aleutian Islands, housing them in unsuitable internment camps in Southeast Alaska and elsewhere. Many became sick and died from the conditions imposed by the government.
Aleutian Islands residents subsequently received reparations from the federal government under legislation that also paid reparations to Japanese Americans also interned during the war.
Livingston’s work isn’t yet complete. He’s also seeking to rename Quisling Cove, a small body of water named after the Norwegian Nazi collaborator Vidkun Quisling. That name change remains pending.

More than $26 million in federal funding was abruptly withheld by the Department of Education last week. Districts and organizations across Vermont fear it will force program and staffing cuts.

School districts and adult learning centers across Vermont are beginning to feel the impact of the $26 million in federal funding President Donald Trump’s administration is withholding from the state.
The U.S. Department of Education told state education officials on the evening of June 30 — less than 24 hours before the funds were set to be dispersed — that they would be conducting a review of the grant programs. No timeline was given for when that would be completed.
The funding pause was part of a broader freeze by the Trump administration of more than $6 billion nationwide for after-school and summer programs and English language instruction.

Six federal grant programs were affected, including Title IIA and Title IIIA grants, which respectively fund professional development for teachers and staff, and support services for English language learners.
In Vermont, the grants for years have helped fund nearly 100 afterschool and summer programs, serving more than 10,000 students, as well as an array of English language programs, according to the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
The abrupt pause in funding has left many school districts in limbo. The announcement, which came just days before the Fourth of July holiday, has sent school officials scrambling to realign their budgets without federal funds.
That is likely to be a tough task for some districts. In the Winooski School District, the funding pause has left a roughly $700,000 budget hole for the high-poverty district, according to the district’s director of finance and operations, Sarah Haven.

The district has primarily used those dollars to fund staff salaries and has signed contracts with its staff through the 2025-26 school year, Haven said.
Because the district is a designated high-poverty district, officials have been able to pool those federal grant dollars together and have primarily tied them to salaries, Haven said.
“The hardest thing about what’s happened here is that this decision came after we had done a lot of financial planning, and we’re caught really off guard,” said Michael Eppolito, the director of curriculum and learning with the Winooski School District.
“We don’t really know what the impact is going to be, other than somebody is going to have to pay for it, particularly because most of this money is tied up in positions that we’ve already agreed that we will pay,” he said.
Eppolito said he expects to cut programming that is not vital.
“We need to start looking anywhere we can to trim things that are not essential,” he said. He pointed to a digital program teachers use to support math and English language arts instruction in the classroom.
Haven said she expects leadership to begin developing an action plan in the coming weeks. Any changes to the district’s budget allocations will need board approval.
She anticipates the district will be able to manage the hit this upcoming school year but said harder decisions may need to be made during next year’s budgeting cycle.
“In the long run it is going to impact the students that have the fewest resources or the most vulnerable students — there’s no doubt that they’re going to be the ones that are hit,” Eppolito said. “And it will be really apparent in Winooski because anything that we cut out is going to affect those kids right away.”
Budget shocks
Other districts took similar hits to their budget. The Essex Westford School District had allocated in its fiscal year 2026 budget more than $400,000 from federal grant funding, according to Mark Holodick, the district’s new superintendent.
“It’s a significant source of funding for us,” he said. “We’ve already had a number of internal meetings. We’re beginning to plan accordingly if these dollars are not released.”
In the Hardwood Unified Union District, Superintendent Michael Leichliter said the funding pause is forcing the district to pause professional development programming.
Leichliter said the federal funding pause threatens to exacerbate an already difficult budget climate for school districts in the state.
“We’ve already been in that trim back mode,” he said. “We’re getting to the point where in order to provide basic services, it will be challenging to reduce any further.”
Holodick, likewise, said his district over the past two years has cut $10 million from its budget.
“What I don’t want to see is the mindset shift from the expectation being, ‘We are providing an outstanding education to our students,’ to ‘This is an adequate educational system where we’re getting by,'” he said. “That worries me greatly with the way we’re chipping away at our budget and resources for our students and families.”
‘Wait and see’
Local school districts are not the only organizations that are affected. The grant money also helped fund adult learning centers, institutions which offer residents a path to earn a high school diploma or GED, as well as offer English language classes and workforce development programs.
Tara Brooks, the head of VT Adult Learning, which runs adult learning services in seven counties throughout the state, said the funding pause will “drastically impact our ability to serve students.”
Her organization last year served nearly 1,500 residents, helping some earn their GED or bolster their English language skills.
Brooks estimated the pause will amount to a nearly $500,000 hit to her organization. If the funds are not released, she said she will have to cut staffing.
“There’s no way around it,” she said. “We already have wait lists for a lot of our bigger locations, so in Chittenden and in and some of our southern locations … it’s only going to increase the wait lists that we have if we have to reduce staff.”
Seam-Marie Oller, who operates The Tutorial Center in Bennington County, said the roughly $36,000 cut to her organization means she will have to cut back on night classes.
“We will continue to do the work with what we have, but I’m cutting people’s hours back, I’m cutting two classes that would be in the evening,” Oller said. “Things like that impact people directly.”
The Vermont Agency of Education has yet to hear from federal officials since their decision last week, according to Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the agency.
Ballard said the agency is “closely coordinating with the governor, the attorney general and our congressional delegation on next steps, as well as continuing to provide intensive support to school districts.”
It’s unclear what the Trump administration will ultimately decide about the funds. Similar federal funding cuts in other sectors have resulted in litigation against the federal government.
Sanders wrote to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought last week, demanding they immediately reverse what he called “their illegal and unconstitutional decision” to withhold those funds.
“Your unexpected and cruel decision has sent shockwaves, distress and heartbreak in local communities all over America who now may be forced to cancel or substantially delay summer school activities that had been planned for months,” Sanders wrote.
“Further, your illegal actions have denied teachers the funding they rely on for professional development,” he added. “Important services for English learners have been halted. Thousands of school principals, superintendents, and school board members may be forced to lay off dedicated staff. And school district budgets in every State and community have been negatively impacted. That is beyond unacceptable.”
Patrick Barham, a spokesperson for Sanders, said they have not gotten a response to their letter.
Some are holding out hope that the funds will be released. Brooks said her organization is “in a wait and see mentality.”
“We’re trying not to knee-jerk react to the news yet,” she said.
Catherine Kalkstein, the head of Central VT Adult Education, which serves Washington, Orange and Lamoille counties, said her organization is relying on reserve funds in the meantime.
“We don’t want to impact our students in any negative way and disrupt the services that we’re currently providing,” she said. “We don’t know whether these cuts are going to stick.”
“But,” Kalkstein added, “it’s not something we can continue to do long term.”
Holodick hoped that officials at the federal level would “come to their senses and release this funding — not just for kids in Essex Westford, or Vermont, but for the students across this country right now.”

But Judge Dana Christensen said he wanted to know whether the federal district court had authority in the first place, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Weldon said the court did not.
Rather, Weldon said the case against Martinez should be heard in immigration court, also the proper venue for raising questions about his rights.

Thursday, the lawyers made their arguments to Christensen before a full gallery in a case that has sparked alarm and outrage in Helena and beyond.
Martinez is a Mexican citizen and national who lives in Helena with his wife and children, according to court records. His wife and their children are American citizens.
After a U.S. Marshals Service officer released his handcuffs in court, Martinez reached out to his family in the gallery and touched the face of the littlest child.
Last week, law enforcement officers arrested Martinez during a hunt for two different people, Venezuelan nationals, according to court records.
Martinez’s lawyers allege he was detained illegally, based on appearing to share the same racial ethnicity as the suspects.
His attorneys said Martinez was engaged in legal activity when he was arrested. They said he was buying parts to fix a hot tub he was repairing.
But a nearby area was under surveillance, and in search of the other suspects, Helena Police Department officers who were part of the task force observed Martinez, a court document said. It said an ICE officer then requested police stop Martinez.
Six minutes later, police determined his truck had expired plates, court records said. They said a masked ICE officer and other officers interrogated Martinez about his immigration status.
The officers could easily have verified Martinez’s identity and confirmed he was not one of their suspects based on a traffic stop the previous day, attorneys said. Instead, they purposefully delayed processing the citation, and ICE officers took him to an unmarked vehicle.
In court, the U.S. Attorney’s office confirmed removal proceedings had started against Martinez.
However, in response to a question from Christensen, Weldon confirmed he understood the judge did not want Martinez deported before he had a chance to issue an order.
The judge ruled Martinez would remain in custody in the meantime.
Martinez’s lawyers are asking the court to find it has jurisdiction in the case, declare his detention violates the Fourth Amendment’s protections against illegal search and seizures, and to release him immediately.
Danahy argued law enforcement officers had no reason to arrest Martinez before they stumbled across his expired registration after first racially profiling him.
And she said the law does not allow officers to “transform” an issue into an immigration case without prior suspicion.
However, the judge read from court records that said Martinez illegally entered the U.S. on multiple occasions and was expelled. The records the judge read said he applied for entry in 2014 and 2018 but was denied and was under a 10-year ban as a result.
Christensen also wanted to know what would prevent the U.S. government from indicting Martinez for illegal re-entry even if he was released from custody.
Danahy, though, said the government gathered evidence about him unlawfully, and the court should stop the government from immediately rearresting Martinez.
Weldon, on behalf of the government, argued Martinez is being held on a lawful arrest warrant, and the parties were essentially “in the wrong courthouse.”
He said Martinez could raise questions about whether his arrest was legal in the immigration court instead.
“Mr. Martinez will have his day in court, but that day is not in this court,” Weldon said.
Christensen said he would issue an order as quickly as possible.
In a press conference after the hearing, Upper Seven founder Rylee Sommers-Flanagan said Martinez did not have a criminal record or warrant for arrest when he encountered ICE agents.
“They were not looking for Christopher,” Sommers-Flanagan said.
However, he has been detained for the past nine days, his lawyers said.
Sommers-Flanagan said the situation is tied to an “aggressive attack” on immigration by the Trump administration, and it presents “a somewhat unprecedented moment for courts.”
“They need to have an opportunity to consider these questions really thoroughly,” she said.
After the hearing, Martinez’s wife, Maria Pacheco, said her husband was deprived of his rights.
She and his lawyers also said he was prevented from seeing an attorney while initially detained in Lewis and Clark County.
“I just think it’s unfair,” Pacheco said. “He should have the time to be with his kids and his wife.”
The hearing drew members of the League of Women Voters of Missoula and members of the public. In a statement, local league President Mary LaPorte said the organization was concerned about the lack of due process afforded to Martinez.
“When due process is denied to some people, it puts all of our rights at risk,” LaPorte said.
Community member Nancy Seldin of Missoula said she showed up to court because she believes the justice system should be fair to all.
“I think it’s important for citizens to show up in support of people who might be subject to extrajudicial proceedings,” Seldin said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3666-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 21:08:25.841988

Based in Kennett Square, Chester County, private equity-backed Genesis HealthCare said in a statement Wednesday that the petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection would permit it to pursue a reorganization plan with minimal disruption. 
It said the reorganization would allow staff to retain their positions, pay and benefits so that patients and residents would continue to be served by providers they trust. Genesis operates 42 facilities in Pennsylvania and a total of 175 across the country.
“We assure all those who rely on us for care that we remain fully focused on and committed to providing the high-quality care you have come to expect, and we thank you for your continued confidence,” Lauren Murray, the company’s chief operating officer, said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A Shapiro administration official said Thursday that Genesis HealthCare’s bankruptcy is another example of a bad outcome when private equity investors become involved in health care. 
“Governor Josh Shapiro strongly believes that private equity should get out of the nursing facility business in Pennsylvania,” Department of Human Services Press Secretary Brandon Cwalina said.
Among his budget priorities this year, Shapiro proposed a plan that would prevent investors from stripping money and resources from nursing facilities, community hospitals and other health facilities. The measure is awaiting action in the state Senate, 
In April, Crozer Health System closed its two remaining hospitals in Delaware County after its parent company Prospect Medical Holdings declared bankruptcy. Efforts to keep Crozer-Chester Medical Center and Taylor Hospital open were unsuccessful, leaving the suburban Philadelphia county of nearly 600,000 people with only two emergency rooms.
Previously owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Prospect was saddled with $1.3 billion debt as its owners took more than $645 million in dividends and fees, according to ProPublica.
The Genesis bankruptcy filings list $708.5 million in secured debt, which the company proposes to satisfy through the sale of its assets to a “stalking horse bidder” affiliated with the primary secured creditors. The bankruptcy petition also lists nearly $800 million in unsecured debt to creditors who include the Internal Revenue Service, vendors and the recipients of legal settlements. 
Pennsylvania is Genesis’ fourth largest unsecured creditor with a $58 million claim for taxes the state collects from some providers participating in Medicaid. 
In its bankruptcy filings, Genesis asks the court to approve $30 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its primary creditors that would allow the company to continue operating, pay its employees and maintain business relationships during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings.
The company’s bankruptcy comes amid uncertainty over how the federal budget reconciliation’s $1 trillion cut to Medicaid over ten years will affect providers across the country. The effect on the state budget, which was due June 30, is also uncertain. Shapiro noted Monday that Pennsylvania would lose billions it can’t afford to backfill. 
The state Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage. Some 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases.
Advocating for Seniors, an association of long-term care providers across the country, said underfunding in Pennsylvania coupled with reductions in the state’s Medicaid reimbursement rates are a major cause of Genesis’ financial distress. 
DHS recently proposed reimbursement rates for nursing facilities, called the budget allocation factor, that would provide long-term care providers only 80% of their calculated reimbursement costs. Those are already based on audited costs and the care needs of patients, according to the association.
“Long-term care facilities cannot keep their doors open in this chaotic and unreliable environment,” said Brittany Crampsie, spokesperson for Advocating for Seniors
Dropping reimbursement rates, staffing ratios that facilities struggle to meet and a late state budget with no certainty about funding for nursing homes will put residents in peril, Crampsie said.

“Facilities are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars every year. Some are closing. Many more are considering that option. We need increased funding in the budget now,” she said.
Cwalina said DHS works to ensure Medicaid recipients have access to quality nursing facility services while operating within the funding the General Assembly appropriates in the state budget. He said it’s inaccurate to say the budget allocation factor is what is pushing nursing facilities to the brink of closure. 
The process for setting the rates and the use of the budget allocation factor is set in state law and the proposed rate assumes that funding in the 2024-2025 budget will remain level. If the amount of funding changes, the rates would be revised. 
“In the case of Genesis HealthCare, this is another private equity-backed health care organization that has bled dry by greed and mismanagement. Genesis owes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania – and its taxpayers – $58 million, and like every taxpaying-resident of Pennsylvania, they should pay their fair share,” Cwalina said. 
Last month, the state House passed legislation proposed by Shapiro to give the state Attorney General’s Office oversight of mergers and acquisitions involving health care companies, prohibit sale-lease back agreements, and require health care facility buyers to submit financial and operational disclosures to the state.
Less than a decade ago, Genesis was the largest skilled nursing operator in the nation, with over 500 facilities and 60,000 beds in 30 states, according to a court filing. The growth strategy wasn’t profitable and it began to divest unprofitable facilities. 
The COVID-19 pandemic struck another blow and Genesis narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2021 with a $100 million injection of capital from private equity firm ReGen Healthcare. 
It also renegotiated its master lease with landlord Welltower, a health care focused real estate investment trust, to which the company owes more than $112.6 million, according to court documents. Welltower is the largest owner of senior housing facilities in the United States, according to Hindenberg Research, which specializes in forensic financial research.
The company’s legacy costs, which include $8 million a month in settlement and defense costs associated with personal injury and wrongful death claims, proved insurmountable, the court papers say.
Genesis said in a court filing that in the first half of the year, it has engaged in negotiations with its creditors to negotiate the terms of a “comprehensive solution” and entered bankruptcy with a “clear and defined exit path.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1483938846-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 21:08:25.841988

Jose Ignacio “Nacho” De La Cruz and his stepdaughter, Heidi Perez, were granted bond during hearings in a Massachusetts immigration court on Thursday. 
Chelmsford Immigration Court judge Natalie Smith granted De La Cruz bond for $10,000 and Perez for $4,000. Both are set to be paid through the Vermont Freedom Fund, an independent nonprofit set up during the first Trump administration by Migrant Justice, an advocacy organization for immigrant rights, according to the group’s spokesperson, Will Lambek.
“Bond is being posted now in both cases,” Lambek said Thursday. “We don’t know exactly when they’ll be released. Probably not today, but shortly.” 
The amount of bond is discretionary, according to Brett Stokes, an attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at Vermont Law and Graduate School who represents De La Cruz and Perez.
“It’s undeniable that Heidi’s case is sympathetic,” Stokes said in a text message Thursday. “The fact that she is 18, just graduated high school, really played with the judge.”

To receive bond during an immigration court hearing, the attorney for a detained immigrant must convince the judge that the person is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. The federal government, on the other hand, seeks to prove that one or both of those risks warrants keeping them behind bars. 
The Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency that oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which held De La Cruz and Perez in detainment since their apprehension almost a month ago, didn’t convince the judge that Perez should be kept in custody, according to Stokes.
“Nacho’s was higher because [the] judge indicated that she believed that Nacho posed a greater flight risk,” Stokes said. 
When considering De La Cruz’s flight risk, the judge weighed the amount of time De La Cruz spent in the U.S. without taking substantial steps toward applying for relief for his potential removal from the country, Stokes said. 
Neither the judge nor the Department of Homeland Security argued that De La Cruz or Perez posed a danger to their community. Stokes called the granting of bonds the right outcome. 
“My heart breaks thinking of the toll that getting to this point took on both of them,” Stokes said. 
Both De La Cruz, 29, and Perez had cases pending in both federal court and immigration court.

In federal court, both filed habeas corpus petitions alleging their initial apprehension on June 14 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection was unlawful and the result of racial profiling. 
The pair were pulled over in De La Cruz’s Ford Transit van on a Saturday around noon after delivering food to local farmworkers who have been apprehensive about leaving their farm in the midst of an ongoing immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, according to court records. Both allege in filings in that case that Border Patrol agents did not give them a valid reason for the stop.
In a declaration filed in support of his habeas corpus petition, De La Cruz stated that Border Patrol Agent Arnold Parent, who initially pulled them over, told him in broken Spanish “that the fact that I spoke Spanish and did not understand English was enough for the stop.” 
In a separate affidavit filed by Parent’s colleague, Parent said he had reasonable suspicion for the stop: He noticed through the van’s windows that both De La Cruz and Perez appeared evasive to law enforcement, with darting eyes, hands clenched on the steering wheel, and the fact that they did not smile or wave when driving past the agent. Parent said he had not seen either on the rural road previously and they were not wearing the typical clothes of farmworkers.
De La Cruz and Perez allege that they were physically harmed by the interaction. De La Cruz’s face was injured when a Border Patrol agent bashed in the driver’s side window, shattering glass, De La Cruz said in his declaration. Agents also twisted Perez’s arm behind her back and injured her nail, she and De La Cruz attested. 
Border Patrol agents threatened further harm to Perez, De La Cruz alleged in his declaration, if he did not cooperate with providing information, such as his fingerprints and DNA. He said an interpreter told him “that they did not want to hurt her again but would do so if it became necessary. He also said that they had children and would not want anyone to harm their own children.” 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Michael Niezgoda told VTDigger on Tuesday that matters around De La Cruz’s and Perez’s cases “all relate to an ongoing criminal prosecution, court proceeding, or immigration hearing currently being litigated in the District of Vermont District Court or Immigration Court,” and therefore would not comment.
Their cases were heard in Massachusetts because Vermont does not have an immigration court that hears ICE cases.
Both De La Cruz and Perez had bail hearings scheduled this week for their federal petition in Vermont Federal District Court in Burlington. Perez’s hearing was delayed after the judge asked for more information from both sides, and De La Cruz’s was postponed. They had a temporary restraining order, which prevented their removal from Vermont by the federal government, until July 31.
Those bail hearings and that restraining order will be nullified. But while De La Cruz and Perez return home from ICE detention, their cases aren’t over. Both their habeas petition and their deportation proceedings will move forward.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)After Republicans found rowdy crowds waiting for them in town halls during the first months of the second Trump administration, Democrats have taken it upon themselves to host similar events in all 50 states. Friday will be Utah’s turn.
California Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs is scheduled to join Utah Democratic Party leaders at the Salt Lake Community College Miller Campus in Sandy, a city that is part of Utah’s 4th Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Burgess Owens.

Brian King, the newly elected chair of the state’s Democratic Party, Millcreek Mayor Jeff Silvestrini, and others are also scheduled to speak with constituents on Friday at 6:15 p.m.
King said this is an initiative aiming to listen to the people where town halls haven’t happened, particularly in red states. Utah’s congressional delegation members, who are all Republican, were also invited to tune in, King said.
“Our feeling on this is simply ‘listen, if you’re an elected official, or if you’re trying to represent people, if you’re running for office, things like that, you need to make sure that you listen to the people that you’re trying to represent and that you find out what they want and don’t want and you receive their criticism,’” King said.
The last time Utah Republican Reps. Celeste Maloy and Mike Kennedy tried to hold a town hall, a crowd of about 300 showed up to protest, booing and jeering throughout the discussion.

King says he doesn’t know what to expect from those attending the Friday town hall. However, he would like to see a mix from a broad political spectrum participating.
“I want to see people who are Trump supporters. I want to hear people who are moderates, and pragmatists, and independents, and unaffiliated, as well as Democratic base voters, and more moderate, pragmatic Democrats,” King said. “I mean the range of people, I hope, is broad and reflects Utah.”
Jacobs, a San Diego congresswoman, was elected Caucus leadership representative in 2022 and now serves in the U.S. House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee. Being a representative of a Western state and sharing characteristics with Utah, King believes Jacobs will be able to understand the state needs.
“We want to have somebody who is in Congress who can come and be sort of a representative for Congress, because our representatives in Congress right now are not basically willing to receive information in a town hall setting from their constituents,” King said.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)RUIDOSO — Taylor Sanchez was taking an afternoon nap on her day off Tuesday, when the dark waters surged in the Rio Ruidoso. A knock on the door from a Lincoln County Sheriff’s Deputy woke her.
“The officers came, they told me, ‘You’ve got to get out, it’s bad, it’s bad,’” she recounted near the twisted wreckage of her home in Galivan trailer park, her 3-year-old son Noah on her hip, and his five-month-old brother burbling in his car seat.
She followed their warnings, grabbed the dogs and picked up her children from daycare. She returned and watched from higher ground as the Rio Ruidoso broke its banks, filming as it swept up her neighbors’ homes and cars. Some of her neighbors needed further rescue. When the waters rose too high, she evacuated to Alamogorodo.

The deadly flooding had displaced at least 300 people as of Thursday afternoon, according to Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also on Thursday announced President Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration, freeing up some funds, but a full disaster declaration has not yet occurred, and the city does not have authorization for funds to pay for shelter, food and other necessities. The declaration covers Chaves, Lincoln, Otero and Valencia counties.

“We’re grateful that this approval will unlock funding needed for immediate disaster response,” the state’s congressional delegation said in a statement, “and we will continue to push President Trump to grant the state’s Major Disaster Declaration request to make sure that all New Mexicans impacted by this disaster are provided with the federal support necessary to rebuild.”
Crawford told Source NM he’s coordinating with the state for now: “We’re trying to find the money to try and find them hotels.”
On Thursday, much of officials’ focus remained on preparing for more flooding, with rains forecasted for Friday. Water service remained out for several neighborhoods, but power has been restored to much of the town. More than 600 people were without power during the floods, according to a PNM spokesman, and the utility lost 38 poles and more than 4,500 feet of lines. Only 10 people remained without power, which was expected to be restored late Thursday.

Taylor, her two sisters and their mother returned for the first time on Thursday to see what could be salvaged from the two homes shared among the sisters. Neighbors joined on front loaders or picked through the wreckage.
“I’d rather lose my house, rather than our lives,” said Rhiannon Sanchez, 25, who lived next door. She had been at a doctor’s appointment with her children on Tuesday. Now, a power pole jutted through the living room of the lilac trailer. Neighbors’ homes, marked with mud nearly to the rooftops, were sheared open, piled haphazardly on top of cars. Children’s toys, a painter’s kit, knitted blankets stripped into the black silt.
The cleanup poses its own dangers.
“The flood waters may have receded but there still may be hazards,” said Chelsea Eastman Langer, bureau chief for the Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau at the New Mexico Department of Health.
“Essentially, the flood waters usually have chemicals and debris, and if left standing in homes, will cause mold,” she said in a statement. “Private wells can also be severely damaged in floods, and well water should be tested after floods.”

Rhiannon sifted through the mud in the home, looking for her ultrasounds, and packed away the ashes of their beloved dog. Her sister Miya Otero carried out a bookcase. Otero, a bartender at the Ruidoso Downs Casino and Racetrack, said her job and life were upended all at once.
The damage from Tuesday’s floods caused officials to cancel the 2025 racing season Thursday, as Downs officials tally the damages, which compounded the damages the track suffered in the 2024 fires.
“I’m not too sure if we’ll stay in Ruidoso, unfortunately,” Otero said. “We’ve lived here our whole lives, almost.”
They won’t rebuild their home, Patricia Sanchez said, even if it means losing the community they had for 15 years.
“We worked our whole lives for what we have then from one day to the next, it’s all gone,” Patricia Sanchez said. “Now, we’re just here to pick up the pieces.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ZAM0798-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 20:08:59.426472

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).Another proposal that would legalize recreational cannabis in Pennsylvania was introduced at the state Capitol Thursday, this time by a bipartisan pair of senators.
But the measure from Senator Dan Laughlin (R-Erie)  and Democrat Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia) seems unlikely to pass any time soon.
The bill comes as state budget negotiations push nearly two weeks past the June 30 deadline. Republican and Democratic negotiators have struggled to agree on how to curb the state’s budget deficit while funding their parties’ priorities.
Posting on Facebook after the new bill was introduced, Laughlin warned, “We’re at the point where tax increases are being discussed in Harrisburg to balance the budget.” Revenue from a tax on legal cannabis, he said, could provide an alternative solution.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the leader of his own party in the Senate, Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), has already thrown cold water on the proposal.
“Discussions surrounding the state budget continue to progress, and we remain committed to a final agreement, which will help to address the structural deficit facing our commonwealth,” Pittman said in a statement provided to the Capital-Star. “However, I do not see a prevailing view for legalization of recreational marijuana within our caucus as part of the current budget.”
The latest bill would legalize cannabis use for Pennsylvanians age 21 and over, and allow possession of up to 30 grams of flower, five grams of concentrate, and 1,000 milligrams of THC contained in marijuana-infused products like edibles. It would also impose a 6% sales tax and an 8% excise tax on all cannabis products.
Non-violent cannabis convictions would be automatically expunged. Eligible inmates would be released from incarceration.
Recreational cannabis is already legal in 24 states, including five of the six that border Pennsylvania — West Virginia being the exception.
Democrats in Harrisburg have broadly supported recreational marijuana legalization for some time, and Gov. Josh Shapiro has repeatedly called on lawmakers to act. But the idea has struggled to gain traction in the GOP-controlled Senate.

Earlier this year, senators shot down another cannabis bill backed by Democrats that passed the House on partisan lines.
Unlike Laughlin and Street’s measure, it would have seen cannabis sold in state stores, like liquor, which was a nonstarter for Republicans and some Democrats.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Immigrant rights advocates in Colorado want Attorney General Phil Weiser to investigate any possible violations of the state’s law against information sharing with federal immigration officials.
The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition on Thursday delivered to a representative from Weiser’s office a petition with over 2,000 signatures calling for an investigation. Leaders said the move represents a demand for public accountability.
“We are not trying to be antagonistic with this action and this petition delivery,” CIRC Organizing Director Nayda Benitez said. “We’re open to working collaboratively with the attorney general’s office to ensure that Colorado state laws are being upheld, and that all Colorado families, regardless of their immigration status, feel safe being here.”

The petition specifically asks for Weiser’s office to ensure that local law enforcement and government agencies are educated on the state’s laws against sharing personal identifying information in immigration cases except when a request for that information is part of a criminal investigation.
Last month, a Denver judge blocked Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, from ordering a state employee to hand over information requested in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment employee, Scott Moss, contended that the information requested — which immigration officials said was to ensure the welfare of unaccompanied immigrant children — ran afoul of state law because the request was not related to a specific criminal investigation and might be used for immigration enforcement.
Polis’ lawyers contended that his office wanted to cooperate with federal criminal investigations into child trafficking and exploitation.
During testimony in that case, CDLE Executive Director Joe Barela said the department had complied with at least one other ICE subpoena in March.
“Let’s be very clear: Gov. Jared Polis knew about these laws when he directed state workers to share information about undocumented children with ICE, because he signed both of those bills into law. Shame on you, Governor,” said Denver City Council member Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez, who sponsored the initial information protection bill in 2021 as a state representative.
The petition also calls for an investigation into an incident in Mesa County earlier this summer when a Utah college student, Caroline Dias Goncalves, was arrested by ICE. Federal agents used information that a sheriff’s deputy shared in a Signal group chat to detain Goncalves after a traffic stop.
Weiser’s office announced on June 23 that it is investigating whether law enforcement followed state law in that interaction.
CIRC also denounced the use by law enforcement of Flock Safety security cameras around the state. The cameras photograph license plates to track vehicles. Local law enforcement mostly uses that information to find stolen vehicles.
An agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives searched Loveland’s Flock data on behalf of ICE six times in April, 9News reported.
Denver City Council voted not to renew its contract with the company earlier this year over concerns that the data could be fed to immigration officials. The cameras are still operational for the current contract period.
“Our immigrant communities are under threat while Flock is still being used across Colorado,” Gonzales-Gutierrez said. “Our city and our state must resist collaborating with ICE under the guise of public safety.”
Weiser spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco said the AG’s office will review the petition and its claims.

Kim Reynolds. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The sound of honking caused several heads to turn toward nearby Fleur Drive during the groundbreaking ceremony for the Italian-American Cultural Center of Iowa at the historic Butler Mansion in Des Moines. 
A small crowd of protesters gathered outside of the Thursday event with signs decrying Iowa’s water quality, which incited the honks.
The protesters gathered there in the hopes of catching Gov. Kim Reynolds’ attention as she attended the groundbreaking for the cultural site that received several million dollars from state and county governments. 
Following the event, Reynolds spoke with reporters about immigration, water quality, the recently signed federal budget bill and how she plans to move past party tension from the eminent domain topic.
Food & Water Watch Iowa Organizer Michaelyn Mankel said the goal of the protest was to catch Reynolds in public, not to protest the Italian-American Cultural Center of Iowa event. 
“But we’re also here to communicate with the public that there are people and political actors responsible for the water crisis that we’re facing,” Mankel said. 
Mankel’s group regularly protests water quality issues in the state, but the subject has been top of mind for many central Iowans who have been under a lawn watering ban since mid June, due to high nitrate concentrations in source water rivers. 
Blake Iverson, a protester from Des Moines, said “it’s absurd” that the city has “one of the most advanced water treatment facilities in the world” yet the water is “not safe to drink.” 
Tap water in Des Moines, continues to be below the federal nitrate concentration limit of 10 milligrams per liter, meaning it is safe to drink according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But some argue, and some data support the idea that health impacts can occur from consuming lower nitrate concentrations. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Central Iowa Water Works reported Thursday the water coming out of treatment facilities had concentrations between 6.7 mg/l and 7.7. mg/l.
Iverson said he doesn’t spend money on an in-home water filter, or purchase water from the grocery store, because it should be the responsibility of the government and the industry to keep the water safe. 


Italian-American community celebrates groundbreaking of cultural center
Members of the Italian-American Cultural Center of Iowa broke ground at the Butler Mansion, located on the south side of Des Moines, which will serve as a permanent home for the group. 
The group received a $2 million grant from the state’s Destination Iowa fund and more than $1 million from Polk County to renovate the 1930s building that was, at the time, called the “the world’s most modern house.”
Once renovated, the site will serve as more than a cultural museum. It will also have an event center, cooking classroom, education center, Italian market, cafe and speakeasy. 
Jeff Lamberti, the center’s chairman, said it was a “historic day” for the group that used to meet in church basements and diners. 
“We want this to be a place for everyone,” Lamberti said. “While preserving and promoting our culture and educating folks about our rich history, we hope to create a destination for all of Iowa.”


A report, commissioned by Polk County, found nearly 80% of nitrate in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers can be traced directly to agricultural sources. 
“It’s an absurd proposition that the majority of Iowans who are not agribusiness CEOs should be expected to suffer for the profits of a tiny minority … of executives and big shareholders in this industry,” Iverson said. 
Protesters did not have a direct interaction with their intended recipient, but Reynolds said to reporters following the event that “we’re working on it everyday” when asked about water quality issues. 
Reynolds said Iowa farmers want to take care of the land to be able to pass it down to the next generation, said it’s “in their best interest to make sure that they’re doing everything that they can to protect the water and soil.” 
Reynolds said more farmers are employing conservation practices like cover crops and bioreactors to help keep nutrients on the field, rather than waterways. The state also announced a nearly $2 million project Tuesday to improve water quality in the Beaver Creek watershed. 
“They are continuing to work on processes that will help improve water quality,” she said.
The “Currents of Change” report also suggested more regulation and data on the ag industry, particularly in terms of manure application to fields. 
Reynolds, asked about this portion of the report, said “regulation is hardly ever the answer.” 
“There’s a huge cost to those (nitrate) inputs, so farmers don’t want to waste it, they don’t want to see it run off,” Reynolds said. “There’s processes right now that they can tell the exact amount that each plant needs to get the growth that they need, and so they’re doing that every single day.” 
Reynolds said she has supported conservation practices throughout her administration and said it’s an area where the state needs to “continue to put our efforts.” 
“But mark my word, they’re working every single day to implement conservation practices because they know it benefits everybody,” Reynolds said. 
Immigration policy, ‘big beautiful bill’ 
Reynolds said earlier this week she hopes Iowa can be part of the conversation with federal agencies as they try to figure out how the agricultural industry can keep undocumented workers on their farms amid the Trump administration’s plans for mass deportations. 
She said Thursday the conversation is possible only because the border has been secured and agencies “continue to remove some of the you know, criminals and bad people.” 
“It just creates a different environment where you can, I think, have some of those healthy discussions to see what that looks like,” Reynolds said. 
She said issue, brought up by President Donald Trump while in Iowa, is a “moving target.”
GOP divisions over eminent domain
The governor vetoed a controversial bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines in June, which garnered criticism from some voices in her own party. Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, even said he would “work to kill” any bill with Reynolds’ name on it in the future.
When asked about the comment, Reynolds said there are “passionate feelings” on both sides of the issue that make it a “difficult issue” moving forward. 
“Time and separation does a lot of good,” Reynolds said. “Most importantly, I think all of us have the same goal, and that really is serving Iowans and making sure that we’re being impactful and we’re getting things done. Iowans are so sick of their government not getting things done.” 
She said Iowa will need to “rethink” how it identifies priorities in order to create meaningful change, especially on the issue of property taxes. 
“We want to keep the cost of moving down, and that is a hardship on some of our families, but … you’re going to have to either be a part of the solution, and there’s going to have to be some changes in how we deliver services, or if they’re not willing to do that, then we’re probably going to end up with the status quo,” Reynolds said. 
She pointed to the recent passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill, named the “big beautiful bill” and said the same thing could happen in Iowa. 
“Now, we need to work through it, we need to see what (the bill) looks like, but the fact that they actually got something done, I think, is incredible, and it really is a testament to President Trump’s leadership,” Reynolds said.

Severe thunderstorms that began earlier Thursday caused flash flooding in parts of the state, particularly in the Northeast Kingdom, according to a press release from the Vermont Emergency Operations Center.
Of particular concern was the east branch of the Passumpsic River at East Haven, which, starting around 3 p.m., rose over 4.5 feet in just over 2 hours to a “minor” flood level, according to the National Water Prediction Service. By 5:30 p.m., levels began to recede.
The flooding washed out part of Route 114, according to a post by NBC5 meteorologist Ben Frechette, and threatened the low-lying Northeast Kingdom Mobile Home Park, located on the northern side of Lyndonville. 

Northeast Kingdom road floods after Thursday’s thunderstorms
In Sutton, one water rescue team was dispatched to “assist the residents of one home cut off by floodwater,” according to the release. In Lyndonville and Stowe, more rescue teams are staging in case assistance is needed.
“The thunderstorms today are going to be capable of producing very heavy rain and frequent cloud-to-ground lightning,” Matthew Clay, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Burlington office, said earlier Thursday afternoon.

Thomson and Kit Gage. Now's not the time for backsliding by the council, they say.","Soldiers use a gas--powered leaf blower to clear an intersection at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, in this photo from 2022. (Photo by Lance Cpl. Lauralle Walker/U.S. Marine Corps)Four members of the Montgomery County Council, led by Councilmember Gabe Albornoz, want to gut the ban on the use of gasoline-powered leaf blowers that took effect on 1 July. The councilors’ 11th-hour proposal would let landscaping companies use gasoline-powered leaf blowers between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, for three years.
Councilmembers supporting this proposed exemption are consigning the health and welfare of landscape workers and county residents to the back seat while favoring firms that have failed to prepare for the ban. As writer James Fallows put it, this amounts to a cruel bargain for workers: People without power jeopardizing their health because those with power aren’t willing to shield them from avoidable risks.
The push to undermine the leaf blower ban comes almost two years after the council voted for it almost unanimously in September 2023, with an exemption for agricultural producers. Councilmember Albornoz’s latest proposal recalls his failed attempt in 2023 to exempt for five years large properties, like golf courses. In voting against the exemption, Councilmember Natali Fani-González, an immigrant, asserted, “This is about the health of low-income workers that we’re trying to protect.”
The council has eased the transition to electric-powered equipment via a rebate program. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, about 250 companies — most of them small businesses — have already received those subsidies and more have applied.

Clearly, many companies are preparing conscientiously for the ban. Further, any company managing leaves in the District of Columbia has had to use electric equipment since 2022.
Nonetheless, four locally elected officials want to cave to industry laggards, saying that, “Commercial landscapers argue that the ban will significantly harm the industry.” No documentation has been offered to support this claim.
But the hazards of gasoline-powered leaf blowers are clear. They are a health menace, especially for vulnerable landscape workers, who are often Spanish speakers and may not know about leaf blower risks. They might not have a choice in the equipment their employers provide. Landscape workers undertake hard labor — often for the very affluent — while earning an average hourly wage in Maryland of $19.76.  In 2024, 48% of landscaping workers nationally identified as Hispanic or Latino.
Gasoline-powered leaf blowers expose landscape workers to harmful noise levels, which can reach 95 to 106 decibels at the user’s ears. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a two-hour exposure to a leaf blower blasting at 90 decibels is enough to cause hearing damage.
Hearing loss is associated with a host of problems, including communication difficulties and dementia. Chronic exposure to noise pollution can cause high blood pressure, heart disease, anxiety, depression and cognitive impairment  in children.
Routine use of gasoline-powered leaf blowers exposes community members to disruptive noise. The low-frequency component of the noise produced by gasoline-powered leaf blowers carries much farther and is perceived as much louder than the noise generated by battery-powered blowers.
A substantial body of evidence indicates that anthropogenic noise is detrimental to wildlife.
Gasoline-powered leaf blowers also expose workers to a toxic air pollution brew of fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, carcinogens, oxides of nitrogen and unburned fuel. They blast whatever is on the ground — dirt, excrement, mold, chemicals, particles — into the air.
Those same air pollutants threaten public health and the environment. Operating a professional backpack leaf blower for one hour produces as much ozone-forming air pollution as driving a light-duty passenger car 1,100 miles. The Baltimore area — which includes Montgomery County’s neighbor, Howard County — still fails to meet EPA’s ozone air quality limit. Leaf blowers emit carbon dioxide, and Montgomery County has an aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goal. Reducing nitrogen oxides air pollution is important to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. An estimated one-third of the Bay’s nitrogen load comes from the air.
Montgomery County’s ban followed those of a long list of cities that have paved the way.  Annapolis and Baltimore City have also adopted bans. Further, in California, new leaf blowers are subject to a zero-emissions standard.  Such policies are undoubtedly pushing manufacturers to improve battery=powered equipment.
Safer leaf-handling methods include rakes and brooms, leaving the leaves, or mulching them with electric equipment.
We will need to keep educating businesses — especially small ones — and county residents about the need to protect workers from gasoline-powered leaf blowers. But the Albornoz proposal, which capitulates to companies that are dragging their feet, is not the answer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7407662-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 20:08:59.426472

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)For the first time in half a dozen years, the number of unhoused people in Rhode Island is on the decline. 
But the good news comes with a caveat: More people were without shelter when volunteers from the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness conducted its annual winter census for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all across the state on a frigid night in January.
Among the people who were either in a shelter or on the street counted on the night of Jan. 21, 2025, over 40% had been unhoused for more than a year, according to data released Thursday.
The results of the 2025 Point in Time count were presented to the board of directors for the Rhode Island Continuum of Care — the collection of state departments and nonprofit organizations that manage the state’s homelessness response — during its monthly meeting at the United Way of Rhode Island. 
At least 2,373 unhoused individuals were counted across the state on that Tuesday night in January when the temperature hovered around 18 degrees in Providence. The number of individuals is down 2.8% from the record high of 2,442 counted in 2024, marking the first decrease since 2019.
“Although an overall decrease seems really exciting, it’s the result of fewer emergency shelter beds being online,” Kimberly Simmons, the coalition’s executive director, told the 12 board members present.
According to Simmons’ presentation, there were 1,826 shelter beds available in January 2025 — representing a decrease of 71 spots compared to the previous year. 
As the number of beds dropped, the number of unsheltered Rhode Islanders rose over 15%. Overall, the coalition counted 618 people whose primary residence is a car, tent, abandoned building, or other outdoor space. Last year that number was 534. 
Around 66% of unsheltered people were considered “chronically homeless,” meaning they were unhoused for more than a year and have a substance or mental health disorder. Overall, 1,022 of those surveyed by the coalition were deemed chronically homeless.

The increase in chronic homelessness was the result of longer lengths of stay  in motels and other shelter space made available by the state. Advocates and lawmakers had pushed Gov. Dan McKee to call for a state of emergency over the winter to try and open up more shelter beds, with a particular focus on expediting the opening of ECHO Village — the community of 45 pallet shelters off Route 146 in Providence.
ECHO Village opened on Feb. 11, after sitting empty for a year as officials struggled to figure out how the cabins fit into the state’s fire and building codes, which had no category for the shelters.
But McKee resisted the calls to rush the village’s opening, contending that an emergency declaration would not yield any federal funds toward the issue and could create potential problems should regulations be relaxed.
“If it had been open in the beginning of the year, more individuals could have been served,” Simmons said in an interview after the board meeting..
And while the total number of unhoused individuals was down from the prior year, Simmons told Rhode Island Current that the census likely undercounted, as there are many people who are couch surfing or have been forced to double up with relatives or friends.
There were some positives from this year’s census. The number of families who are unhoused decreased by 1.1% — with no unsheltered families counted. Transitional housing increased by three beds and the state saw an additional 37 permanent supportive housing units go up.
Simmons said she is concerned that the state’s homeless population could skyrocket in the future as the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans cut funding for social programs.
“We’re still in the hole,” she said.

(Courtesy Indianapolis Bar Association)Lawyers, law students and other fans of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson erupted in cheers and a standing ovation — eagerly snapping far-off, hazy cell phone photographs during the single occasion it was allowed — as she appeared Thursday at an Indianapolis Bar Association luncheon nestled within the Indiana Convention Center.
Guided by moderator and U.S. District Court Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson of Indiana, she covered the personal — giggly tales of meeting her husband of 28 years — and got serious.
“What keeps you up at night?” Magnus-Stinson asked, during a “lightning round” of questioning.
“I would say the state of our democracy,” Brown Jackson confessed.
Role models, turning points and more
Brown Jackson, the first Black female justice in the court’s 236-year-history, always hoped to pursue law.
“My father, who was a public school teacher when I was born, went back to law school when I was three years old, and some of my earliest memories are of sitting at the kitchen table, and he has his law books, and I have my coloring books, and we’re working together,” she told the crowd. “So I had always thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I didn’t know what else you’re supposed to do.”
But it was in learning about Constance Baker Motley, the first Black female federal judge, that she thought: “I could be a judge.” And it was Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman on the Supreme Court, who inspired her to aim even higher.
She spoke to promote “Lovely One,” the memoir she began writing upon her confirmation to the court, with the goal of “pay(ing) tribute to the people and the circumstances that I thought were really most responsible for that success.”
That began with her grandparents, who grew up in Georgia “in the early 1900s, in a time that was really significantly restricted for African Americans.” Neither graduated from formal schools; her grandfather chauffeured white families.
They moved to Florida, and her grandfather drove for a beer company — until he “got fed up with how he was being treated” — and launched a landscaping business. It financed education for his five children, including Brown Jackson’s mother. All were first-generation college students.

Even the timing of her 1970 birth mattered, Brown Jackson told the crowd. It was shortly after the end of Jim Crow Segregation and after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act.
“My parents had grown up in Florida under segregation, having their life opportunities restricted,” she recounted.
“I’m born … and my parents thought, this is our shot. This is our shot to do everything that we didn’t get a chance to do,” she continued. “So our daughter’s going to be in the swimming lessons if there’s swimming lessons; she’s going to do the piano lessons if there’s piano lessons.”
Brown Jackson later attended Harvard University, where, Magnus-Stinson noted, “racism was not a strange experience.” One student hung a large Confederate flag — representing the failed attempt at secession by 11 slave-holding states — from a dormitory window along the prominent Harvard Yard. A bulb illuminated it 24 hours daily.
As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against the student, but realized it was taking time from her study and work.
“The very real function of racism is distraction,” she said, citing writer Toni Morrison. “… It was a big turning point in the way that I view my purpose, which is to stay as focused as I can on the work that I’m called to do.”
“Let’s (not) be distracted from the good work that we want to do and the oath that … we took for the people we’re here to serve,” Magnus-Stinson agreed.
Brown Jackson, who is also the first public defender to join the Supreme Court, described how the experience shaped her commitment to communicating with defendants.
“They might not agree with what ultimately happened to them if I sentenced them or whatever, but they weren’t going to be confused about the process,” she said. Treating defendants with respect, she said, was “crucial for their rehabilitation.”
Throughout her remarks, Brown Jackson emphasized the value of speech and debate, clerkships and networking to the rapt audience.

The fishing restrictions prohibit angling on the designated stretches of river from 2 p.m. to midnight each day and will remain in place until conditions improve.
The new restrictions are as follows:

Silver Bow Creek — entire creek
Upper Bitterroot River — from the confluence of the East and West Forks to Veterans Bridge at Hamilton
Upper Clark Fork River — from the Clark Fork’s origin at the confluence of Warm Springs Creek and Silver Bow Creek to the mouth of the Blackfoot River
Upper Rock Creek– from the confluence of the West and Middle Forks to the mouth of Stoney Creek

Hoot-owl restrictions are already in place on other rivers across southeast and central Montana.

In accordance with the department’s drought policy, FWP institutes angling restrictions when streamflows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.
The restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when water temperatures warm and can help reduce catch-and-release mortality by restricting fishing to only cool morning hours.
Catch-and-release anglers can reduce stress on fish by getting them to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.
As the summer warms, Montana offers many other angling options with better conditions for fish, including larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation lakes and streams.
Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors flows and in some streams holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

[…]","The sign for Rosebud coal mines, owned by Westmoreland (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).The entire Montana Congressional delegation has introduced a measure in Congress — in both the House and Senate — that would overturn a Biden administration rule issued by the Bureau of Land Management halting any future coal leases on federal land from its Miles City office, which oversees part of the Powder River coal tract.
The decision to end coal leasing in the eastern portion of the state drew the ire of state and federal Republicans, but would not have ended coal production for companies which already have leases.
On Thursday, Montana’s two Senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, along with its two Congressmen, Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing, all of whom are Republican, introduced the legislation that would overturn and invalidate the decision. Such a move by Congress would shortcircuit the decision-making process that federal agencies have to follow to determine how and when to use federal land, as well as a requirements for public comment and feedback. Overturning the Biden-era decision is one of the ways the legislative branch, Congress, can check the executive branch.
“Montana’s Second Congressional District keeps the lights on in the Treasure State. Under the Biden Administration, Montana energy production took a direct hit when an outright ban on coal leasing in the Powder River Basin went into effect. I’m proud to lead this CRA in the House to reverse this disastrous management plan amendment that threatens access to affordable, reliable energy and investment in the communities I represent,” said Downing in a joint press release.
The Miles City BLM office is in Downing’s Congressional district. The Powder River Basin extends into northern Wyoming, including the coal mining activities in Gillette, Wyoming. However, the portion of public lands in Wyoming is overseen by a field office in Buffalo. In Montana, it encompasses more than 2.7 million acres of BLM land, across 17 counties in the eastern part of the state.
Closing the federal land to coal mining was one of several options that were considered by the Biden administration in 2023-’24. The federal tracts of land, though, were also subject to heavy litigation from conservation and environmental groups which challenged the permitting processes in federal court. A federal judge in Montana had previously ruled that federal officials did not adequately assess the environmental impacts of the coal when determining whether to open more land for coal mining.
It is also unclear if there is more interest in coal mining.
For example, the Absaloka Mine, which provided an economic engine for the Crow Indian Reservation in south-central Montana, lost its last customer in 2024.
Currently, several large companies have already secured coal mining tracts for years, if not decades. In Montana, Westmoreland mines coal near Colstrip to fire the large generation station there. Current leases for Westmoreland estimate that the company can continue to mine until 2060.
The Spring Creek Mine in Decker, which is owned by the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, has permits and leases that would continue through 2035, even without the change.
Mining permits in Wyoming run through 2041.
The Biden-era BLM decision was a huge blow to coal mining in America, though. Powder River Basin coal between Montana and Wyoming makes up about 85% of federal coal production and 40% of the coal production in all the United States. However, since 2008, the year of Powder River Basin’s peak production, demand for coal has been on the decline, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Still, if the legislation overturning the Biden-era rule is successful, it’s unclear how many acres would become open for mining. Originally, as the Miles City office was considering its future plans, it evaluated four different options. The other leasing options that were considered would have allowed from 1.2 million federal acres to be leased for coal mining to as few as 810.
“It’s time to put an end to the Biden-era, job-killing, environmentalist mandates, and this resolution will help achieve that. As we work to unleash Montana energy, we must support Montana’s resource economy in building a successful future, creating jobs, and powering America. Montanans voted to make America energy dominant so we can bring down prices for families and boost real wages for the hardworking Americans who keep our economy running,” Sheehy said.
In addition to conservation groups challenging the health and environmental impacts of more coal leasing, others have raised the question of coal’s viability with the shrinking number of domestic coal-fired power plants.
“Efforts to roll back BLM’s common sense plan on coal leasing are more about politics than protecting the prosperity of Montanans,”said Mark Fix, a Miles City rancher and member of Northern Plains Resource Council. “Coal simply can’t compete in the marketplace with today’s more affordable and reliable renewable energy sources. State officials should focus on positioning Montana to be a leader in robust, growing energy sectors rather than trying to prop up an industry in decline. Let’s work to create good-paying, long-term cleanup jobs for coal workers while transitioning to meet the demands and economic opportunities of today’s energy markets.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-9895-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 19:10:21.970978

Chuck Grassley told reporters this week he is committed to investigating the “political weaponization” of the state’s justice systems by members of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation over indictments of President Donald Trump.
On Tuesday, Justice Department officials said former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey are under investigation for potential wrongdoing related to Trump investigations, with the possibility for prosecution in the future, Fox News reported.
In a weekly news call Wednesday, Grassley declined to weigh in on whether Justice officials had committed crimes related to the Trump-Russia probe or other actions investigating the president.

“I can’t say that the wrongdoing I have pointed out so far, it’s more in the area of political weaponization of the FBI and the Department of Justice, and I can’t say it rose to the criminal level,” Grassley said. “But evidently the Department of Justice has reason to believe that crime has been committed, and I’ll have to defer to them. That’s their job, not mine. My focus is on transparency and accountability for the American people.”
Brennan said in a Wednesday MSNBC interview that he has not been contacted by the DOJ or CIA about the investigation, but said he believed the action was politically motivated.
“I think this is, unfortunately, a very sad and tragic example of the continued politicization of the intelligence community, of the national security process,” Brennan said. “And quite frankly, I’m really shocked that, you know, individuals are willing to sacrifice their reputations, their credibility, their decency to continue to do Donald Trump’s bidding on something that clearly is just politically based.”
The Iowa Republican reiterated his commitment as the Senate Judiciary chair to following up on justice officials involved in Trump’s federal indictments that occurred during former President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump was charged in 2023 by the Justice Department under the Biden administration in two cases. He faced four felony counts related to fraud and obstruction of justice for his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results that spurred the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, and a 37-count indictment for keeping classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving the White House.
These cases were dismissed, and later dropped in November 2024 after Trump won the 2024 presidential election.
Grassley has repeatedly said he plans to investigate the misuse of power and federal authority by Justice officials against Trump, in both the indictment cases as well as actions taken on issues like the Russia probe during his first term in office. Speaking at the Iowa State Fairgrounds ahead of Trump’s appearance July 3, Grassley said of the DOJ and FBI, “everybody who had anything to do since President Trump went down that golden elevator in 2015 have been trying to get him out of the presidency, or when he was out of the presidency, into prison.”
“So we’re getting some whistleblowers their jobs back,” Grassley said at the event. “We are releasing documents.”
Grassley told reporters he wants to get “justice for the whistleblowers” who were fired or disciplined because they contacted him about their concerns about the actions taken regarding Trump, in addition to bringing more transparency to what occurred in these cases and investigations by releasing documents.
The longtime Republican senator said he is working with Justice officials in the Trump administration on these issues.
“I’ve had the cooperation of the FBI and the Department of Justice in doing this in ways that I’ve never had, even under previous Republican administrations,” Grassley said. “And because of what you might call the administrative state and the fact that they don’t want to give out information that may be embarrassing to them. So maybe the people that I’m trying to embarrass now aren’t in government anymore, but the American people need to know what was covered up and I’m trying to uncover it.”
Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee have taken some actions on these cases in recent months. In early June, Grassley released a declassified internal FBI analysis from 2019 raising allegations against Nellie Ohr, who was involved in compiling information for Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI counterintelligence investigation into alleged ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.
The declassified document alleged Ohr had provided false information in her testimony before Congress when she said she did not have knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation into Trump. Ohr worked as a contractor for Fusion GPS, the firm hired by 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee to conduct political opposition research, and is married to Bruce Ohr, a former DOJ official.
“(Nellie) Ohr never suffered consequences for advancing the phony Trump-Russia narrative and attempting to cover up her involvement in the hoax,” Grassley said in a news release on the document. “Yet time and again, the American justice system has been weaponized against President Trump and his associates with reckless abandon.”
In May, Grassley and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, requested records from the National Archives and Records Administration related to the Trump election interference and alleged mishandling of classified information cases, as well as earlier investigations that led to these charges. Grassley and Johnston had previously released whistleblower reports on FBI investigations into Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.
“The documents we have released show a politically-driven conspiracy that began at the hands of a group of anti-Trump FBI officials who worked closely with Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors in an investigation known as ‘Arctic Frost,'” the senators wrote. “… We are seeking additional records from your offices on this matter pursuant to our ongoing investigation.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who drew attention at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference for slamming politicians on the left and the right for centering division over consensus, has put forth a lofty promise in his campaign for governor: No budget from lawmakers, no pay for lawmakers. 
While members of the Democratic-led Michigan Senate and the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives failed to broker a deal by their legal deadline of July 1, Duggan announced Thursday that his first move if elected, would be to call for a law to suspend the salaries of state elected officials if they fail to approve the state budget by the legal deadline.
“We are just six weeks from the start of the school year and none of Michigan’s 4,000 public schools has a real budget. Principals and teachers can’t properly hire or plan for their school’s opening without knowing their budget and it’s always our children who pay the price for this chaos,” said Duggan, a longtime Democrat who announced an independent bid for governor last December. 
Although Michigan law requires the Legislature to pass a state budget by or on July 1, the law carries no penalties. If lawmakers fail to reach a deal when the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 the state will face a government shutdown. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, Michigan schools must pass their budgets by the end of June, meaning the legislature’s failure to meet the July 1 deadline has left districts throughout the state in the lurch. 
“For the past six months, Democrats and Republicans in Lansing have been stuck in toxic partisan gridlock. Then, they gave up on July 1 and went home without passing a budget,” Duggan said. 
Duggan noted that in his 12 years as mayor, Detroit has met its legal budget deadline in all 12, calling for a change to “politics as usual” in Lansing. 
Alongside suspending salaries for members of the House and Senate, Duggan’s proposal would apply to the governor and lieutenant governor. 
Duggan further slammed Lansing politicians for allowing partisanship to get in the way of progress, pointing to the state’s long decline in 4th grade reading scores, an issue Duggan has made central to his campaign. 
“Instead of addressing the crisis in the schools, Lansing has made it worse by failing to pass a schools budget,” Duggan said. “I promise you this: If we hold up salaries, we’ll get a school budget approved immediately. If there’s one issue that Democratic and Republican legislators agree on, it’s that they all want their paychecks.”
Michigan ranks 44th in the nation in 4th grade reading levels, with Duggan demanding additional accountability, giving principals in failing districts three years to turn things around before they would be fired, and a new leadership team would be put in place. 
Duggan pitched a $4.5 billion plan for school funding during his keynote address at the 2025 Mackinac conference, though he offered few financial details. 
While Duggan struck out from his long-held home in the Democratic Party, several other Democrats have sought to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, including Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla., Mayor Marni Sawicki.

Displayed on the screen is a picture of the grass median just west of the intersection between Chenal Parkway and Markham Street in Little Rock. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin criticized municipalities for not doing more to curb what he characterized as unsafe loitering during a press conference Thursday.
Griffin called on city and county officials to do more to enforce Act 255 of 2023, an anti-loitering law that replaced a law targeting panhandlers that was struck down by a federal judge in 2020 for violating the First Amendment.
Under the act, anyone who “lingers or remains” on a sidewalk, road or parking lot in a manner that is “harassing or threatening,” is “likely to cause alarm,” or “create[s] a traffic hazard or impediment” could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in prison and $500 fine if found guilty.
“This is the sort of thing that is the responsibility of cities and counties and communities, not the attorney general’s office, but I will be a backstop,” Griffin warned. “If this is not fixed, I’m going to take action myself.”
Griffin rotated through slides displaying images of individuals standing near busy intersections around Little Rock, oftentimes with signs asking for monetary assistance. The attorney general said he lives near Cantrell Road, which often sees individuals standing on concrete medians or the side of the road asking for money.
“Some of these individuals have been seen parking their truck down the street, down the block, and then they walk down, and they do this every single day,” Griffin said. “This is where they go for their daily job, or whatever you want to call it.”
Megan Bailey, a spokesperson for the ACLU of Arkansas, which filed the lawsuit that eventually led to the state’s 2017 anti-loitering law to get struck down, said the state has “a long and shameful history” of using such laws to “criminalize poverty and silence vulnerable people.” Bailey called Griffin’s demand for increased enforcement of Act 255 “a dangerous step backward that risks violating Arkansans’ constitutional rights.”
“Courts across the country, including here in Arkansas, have repeatedly struck down broad anti-loitering and anti-panhandling laws as unconstitutional,” Bailey wrote in an emailed statement. “That’s because these laws aren’t really about safety; they’re about pushing poor people out of public view.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Griffin said the issue isn’t that these individuals are asking for money — it’s that they are creating what he described as a safety hazard because they’re putting themselves at risk of getting hit by a car and are distracting drivers.
“When you have people that close to the road with signs, people are reading the signs, or they’re slowing down, or they’re stopping in the middle of the road, even when the light’s green and they’re passing things out of their car, and they’re causing a hazard,” he said.
According to Arkansas code 27-51-104, it is illegal for drivers to drive “too close to or colliding with parked or stopped vehicles, fixtures, persons, or objects adjacent to the public thoroughfares” or “to operate a vehicle in any manner when the driver is inattentive and such inattention is not reasonable and prudent in maintaining vehicular control.”
Griffin told the Advocate that what constitutes a traffic hazard or impediment in line with the law is a “judgement call based on the particular circumstances.”
“If you’re 100 feet from a road, you’re not a traffic hazard. If you’re hanging out into the road, I would say that’s a traffic hazard. If you’re standing like this,” Griffin said, scrunching up his shoulders and gesturing to indicate cars passing by, “with cars going by on a strip about two feet, that’s probably a traffic hazard.”
Griffin said that cities cannot be top-notch “with this kind of nonsense going on.”
“You can’t be a first-class city, a first-class community, with this kind of stuff going on,” Griffin said, displaying a slide showing trash that he claimed was left behind by such individuals.
Bailey had a different perspective.
“The government cannot arrest the state’s way out of poverty, and it certainly can’t police people into invisibility,” she said. “Real public safety means access to housing, healthcare, and support — not criminal citations and jail time for simply existing in public.”
Aaron Sadler, a spokesperson for the city of Little Rock, which was featured in many of the photos shown by Griffin, said the city’s police department works “tirelessly” to enforce laws at all levels of government. He said the city had confidence in the abilities of local and state law enforcement to protect motorists and pedestrians in Little Rock.
“Every day, LRPD [Little Rock Police Department] meets and exceeds its responsibilities to uphold the law and keep residents and guests safe,” Sadler said in a text message.

Free.,ICE official’s court testimony provides few answers on agency’s plan for Abrego Garcia,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ice-officials-court-testimony-provides-few-answers-agencys-plan-abrego-garcia,,"GREENBELT, Maryland — A top U.S. immigration official testifying in federal court Thursday did not give details of the Trump administration’s plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released from pre-trial detention next week in Tennessee.Thomas Giles, the assistant director for enforcement and removal operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was noncommittal about how the agency would handle Abrego Garcia if he is released from jail in Tennessee where he awaits trial on federal charges, saying officials could not consider the question until he’s in ICE custody.“There’s been no decision made as he's not in ICE custody,” Giles said.Department of Justice attorneys have said they would seek Abrego Garcia’s removal again, because he has a final order of removal, but have not detailed the process for that deportation, raising concerns of a lack of due process in the closely watched case that were not answered by Giles’ testimony Thursday.Giles appeared after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration on Monday to produce a witness to detail the plan for Abrego Garcia’s removal.The government is likely to pursue either a revocation of the deportation protections the El Salvador national and longtime Maryland resident has had since 2019 that bar deportation to his home country, or removal to a country other than El Salvador.Abrego Garcia was wrongly removed in March to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador where he says he faced psychological and physical torture.ICE detainerGiles said that ICE placed a detainer on Abrego Garcia last month, meaning the agency requested the U.S. Marshals to notify ICE when he will be released so immigration officials can detain him. Abrego Garcia could be released July 16 after a pretrial hearing that day in Tennessee.The Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last month to face federal charges of human smuggling that stemmed from a 2019 traffic stop. Abrego Garcia has denied the charges.Abrego Garcia’s attorneys said in court Thursday that they found out Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. through media reports and they were given no information by the Trump administration.DOJ attorneys said that Abrego Garcia will be removed from the U.S. before his trial in Tennessee is complete.Restraining order consideredAttorneys for Abrego Garcia said Thursday they are concerned he will again be removed without due process or the ability to challenge his removal to another country if he fears he will experience harm or persecution. Earlier in the week, they pressed for Xinis to have Abrego Garcia brought back to Maryland, rather than remain in Tennessee. Xinis is still mulling that request from Abrego Garcia’s attorneys. This week, she also denied the Department of Justice’s move to dismiss the case as moot, because Abrego Garcia had been returned to the U.S.Xinis said Thursday she is considering issuing a temporary restraining order if Abrego Garcia is released on pre-trial detention. The order would last for 48 business hours and bar immigration officials from removing Abrego Garcia to a detention center outside of Tennessee or from the U.S.She also called for a hearing on Friday at 9 a.m. ET on the temporary restraining order.Vague answersSascha Rand, an attorney representing Abrego Garcia in the immigration case in Maryland, grilled Giles on how familiar he was with Abrego Garcia’s case.Giles said that he had not directly overseen Abrego Garcia’s case and had about four hours to prepare for Thursday’s hearing.Rand asked Giles which country Abrego Garcia would be removed to if not El Salvador.Giles said that if Abrego Garcia is removed to a third country, it would take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to determine which country.  Giles said that Mexico is one country that accepts nationals from other countries – including El Salvador – and has diplomatic assurance that an individual removed won’t face harm.He added that South Sudan is also a country that the Trump administration has deemed acceptable to send deportees to.In a ruling last month, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with removing eight men from different nationalities to South Sudan, which recently experienced a civil war. The U.S. State Department advises against traveling to the country.Xinis asked Giles if Mexico, “at a minimum,” would be a country Abrego Garcia could be removed to.Giles said that was possible.Rand asked if South Sudan was a possibility.Giles said that “we have removed people to South Sudan.”Rand then asked Giles multiple times which path the Trump administration was considering for Abrego Garica, either deportation to a third country, or trying to remove the 2019 bar on removal to El Salvador.“Do you have any actual knowledge of which one of these tracks Mr. Abrego Garcia might be put on next Wednesday?” Rand asked.Giles said because Abrego Garcia is not in ICE custody, a discussion on the options for his removal is not happening. He said those determinations will be made once Abrego Garcia is in ICE detention.Giles added that it’s also unclear where Abrego Garcia will be held in ICE detention, as it’s based on available bed space, meaning Abrego Garcia could be transferred anywhere in the U.S.",,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, effectively stripping cities of the power to enact their own labor protections.
Nearly 73 million workers live in the 18 states that now have such preemptive laws, according to a new report from A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization focused on workplace rights, and the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.
“Local leaders know what’s best for their communities. To take away the decision-making power from local communities on this issue and others is very, very concerning,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director of the Southern office at A Better Balance, and one of the report’s authors.
Missouri became the 18th state after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed a bill into law repealing paid leave requirements that voters had approved in November.
More GOP states embrace paid parental leave for teachers, public employees

Missourians had approved a ballot measure that expanded access to paid sick leave for about 728,000 workers who lacked it. Republican state lawmakers promptly passed a bill to repeal it.
Kehoe in a statement called the paid sick leave mandates “onerous,” saying they dictated when and how sick leave was provided and had “burdensome” recordkeeping and compliance obligations. Laws preventing local requirements are still in effect.
Nationwide, about 27 million workers don’t earn paid sick days, the report found. Many of them work low-wage and part-time jobs, and they’re disproportionately likely to be women, younger workers and people of color, according to the report.
“Folks are facing impossible choices between their own health — or the health of their children — and continuing to earn a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table,” Freeland told Stateline.
In the absence of federal laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers, more cities and local governments have passed their own, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
But lawmakers in 18 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, have done the opposite, the report found. GOP legislators have said such paid leave requirements create financial hardship for employers, particularly for smaller businesses.
Over the past decade, in GOP-led states across the country, Republican lawmakers have tried to limit the policymaking power of Democratic-led urban centers on issues ranging from immigration to voting rights to LGBTQ+ matters.
Voters deliver mixed verdicts on increasing minimum wage, but support paid sick leave

While all of the states that preempt local paid sick leave laws are Republican-led, many conservative-led states in the Mountain West don’t have such laws.
Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership and another author of the report, said that’s because Western states tend to have more of a libertarian bent. And she said preemption laws in the South have their roots in historically racist standards that undervalue Black workers.
More than half the Black labor force — 56% — lives in one of the 18 states that prohibit local paid sick time protections, the report said.
Freeland also pointed out that the paid sick leave issue impacts not just urban centers, but rural communities as well. Many people without paid sick leave work in physically demanding jobs such as manufacturing and farming.
The report’s authors say that paid sick leave laws can help reduce the spread of illness, increase employment and wages, particularly for women with child care responsibilities, and can help recruit and retain workers.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The state of Rhode Island will receive a total of $3 million from eight pharmaceutical companies accused of proliferating the nation’s opioid crisis as part of a nationwide settlement announced by Attorney General Peter F. Neronha Thursday. 
The eight drugmakers that manufactured opioid pills will pay a maximum of $720 million under an agreement reached with a coalition of attorneys general. That amount includes approximately $618,000 in abatement payments for all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. States may also receive additional cash instead of free pharmaceutical products for medication assisted treatment.
Neronha’s office has so far recovered $315 million in funds from national settlements with drug manufacturers and pharmacies connected to the opioid epidemic. 
“$315 million is a lot of money which can make, and has made, a huge difference,” Neronha said in a statement. “But we won’t stop until no individual, no family, suffers further from this entirely preventable disease.”
The announcement comes after Rhode Island netted around $30 million from a settlement reached with Purdue Pharma and its owners in April.
Rhode Island’s share of the latest settlement will be divided between the state and its municipalities — with 80% going to the state’s general fund and the remaining 20% distributed among the state’s 39 cities and towns, as is required under state law, the AG’s office said. 
A separate section of state law enacted in 2023 addresses “non multi-state initiatives,” creating a new restricted receipts account for money from settlements with opioid manufacturers. That is handled by the Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee, which Neronha said allocates the funds to organizations and agencies “best equipped to help” those struggling with opioid addiction.
“The good news: we are seeing real results from these efforts, from expanding the state’s in-patient and out-patient treatment capacity, to driving down overdose and overdose deaths,” Neronha said.
 



How much each drug manufacturer has settled for

Mylan (now part of Viatris) will pay $284,447,916 over nine years. (Rhode Island’s share: $1.44 million)
Hikma will pay $95,818,293 over one to four years. (Rhode Island’s share: $470,445)
Amneal will pay $71,751,010 over 10 years. (Rhode Island’s share: $393,497)
Apotex will pay $63,682,369 paid in a single year. (Rhode Island’s share $290,055)
Indivior will pay $38,022,450 over four years. (Rhode Island’s share: $176,397)
Sun Pharma will pay $30,992,087 over one to four years. (Rhode Island’s share: $141,161)
Alvogen will pay $18,680,162 over a single year. (Rhode Island’s share: $85,083)
Zydus will pay $14,859,220 over a single year. (Rhode Island’s share: $67,599)

 



Seven of the companies will be barred from promoting or marketing opioids, along with selling any product that contains more than 40 milligrams of oxycodone per pill. 
Indivior agreed to not manufacture or sell opioid products for the next 10 years, but can continue marketing and selling medications to treat opioid use disorder.
Companies must also monitor and report suspicious orders, under the settlement.
Massachusetts could receive up to $17 million, Connecticut could receive $8.4 million and New Hampshire stands to receive $4.5 million, according to news releases.

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a new measles case Thursday, more than a month since the last case was reported.
The new case is in Williams County involving a person who recently traveled out of state and was unvaccinated against the disease, said Mindy Michaels, a spokesperson for the department.
The state now has 35 confirmed measles cases, with the first one confirmed April 29 in Williams County in northwest North Dakota. Until this week, the state had not confirmed a case since May 28, according to the state’s measles dashboard. 
The latest case is unrelated to the previous cases and there is no evidence of community spread, said Jenny Galbraith, adult immunization manager for HHS.
The new case is the 17th reported in Williams County, the most in the state, followed by 10 cases in Grand Forks County, seven in Cass County and one case in Burke County. Two hospitalizations were reported.
All North Dakota cases have involved people who were unvaccinated.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit in Williston, said people should still isolate themselves if they are feeling ill. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a bodywide rash, according to HHS.
A single incubation period for measles can be as long as 21 days from an initial exposure.
Vaccination remains the best protection against contracting measles, Clark said.
People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.
The department said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old.
Clark said the Upper Missouri District Health Unit will continue to operate its walk-in vaccine clinic for measles every Thursday. She added the foot traffic for the MMR vaccine has slowed since the outbreak was first reported, but people should also be thinking about getting their back-to-school immunizations.
“We start doing our messaging to remind people after the Fourth of July because what we don’t want is everybody trying to come in the couple days before school starts,” she said.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)On Jan. 30, 2023, a person facing criminal charges in New Mexico texted the judge in their case: “I will see you at your next yard sale, I know where you live.”
In August the same year, another person texted a judge: “Either you accept it or you fight me old man…if you refuse to step down…this is war.” 
More recently, police allege 50-year-old Francisco Benjamin Cabral, of Farmington followed Eleventh Judicial District Court Judge Bradford Dalley in his car before approaching Dalley’s vehicle and screaming: “You’re dead, I am going to kill you.” He is scheduled to head to trial this summer.
An official with New Mexico’s judicial branch recently cited these and other examples of violent threats against judges and court staff as reasons to consider creating an internal security force for the courts rather than relying on local police.
So far this year, judges have faced 162 threats, some tied to high-profile cases, according to Cynthia Pacheco, director of the Court Operations Division at the state Administrative Office of the Courts, who delivered a presentation recently to members of the interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee. Most did not result in charges because judges didn’t want to make a complaint, or the callers couldn’t be identified, she said.
State prosecutors thus far in 2025 have filed four criminal cases for threatening a judge or their immediate family members under the new law. Prosecutors filed five such cases last year, and three in 2023.
A law passed in 2022 that made it a felony to threaten a judge or a judge’s immediate family member has resulted in a few convictions thus far — such as the two examples cited from 2023 — but Pacheco told lawmakers it’s “too soon to know if that law is having an impact, it’s just been a couple years. We’re just beginning to charge and take those to trial.”
Staff receive the majority of threats because they’re the ones who answer the phones and work at the front, she said.
Angry people have allegedly told bailiffs and court clerks that someone would be waiting for them outside when they leave their shifts, threatened to bomb their workplaces, posted their home addresses online and threatened them with sexual violence, Pacheco told Source NM.
Between July 2024 and the end of June 2025, defendants, victims or their families have threatened court staff in New Mexico on 10 different occasions, 17 times in the previous year and 13 times the year before that, according to AOC data.
The data also shows a total of 32 threats against court buildings over those three years, along with a growing number of medical episodes in courthouses. Pacheco said most of these are drug overdoses, and that judges and court staff are trained to administer the overdose-reversing drug known as Narcan.
Court staff and judges who are subject to particularly egregious threats can receive mental health services provided by AOC’s employee assistance program, she said.
With growing incidents, Pacheco told lawmakers judicial officials believe a discussion needs to occur about whether it’s time for the state’s judicial branch to have court marshals, similar to the U.S. Marshals Service’s role in the federal court system.
She also noted the judicial branch in the most recent session had requested $25 million for security upgrades but only received $6 million. The judiciary will use the money to upgrade courts in Catron, Cibola, De Baca, Harding, Hidalgo, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe and Union counties, she said.
But she said her agency wants every courthouse in the state to have magnetometers, X-ray machines, access control, duress alarms and surveillance systems.
After those come online, she said, AOC wants to install advanced physical security like modern secure entrances called sally ports, windows treated to resist bullets, hardened clerical counters and the ability to lock down a building without having to run and physically lock every door.
But even if the courts had all that, they would still need security officers present during business hours, Pacheco said.
“Right now, that is not the standard in any courtroom, anywhere in New Mexico,” she said.
She said her agency has started talking with court systems in Oregon and Maine that have established their own state court marshals.
“Court security is a really specialized field because we want people to come to the courts, the courts should be inviting for people who are seeking justice,” Pacheco said in an interview with Source. “But we also have to make sure that everyone is safe.”
Committee Chair Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces) had questions for Pacheco about staffing an internal service and how she thought it would differ from using sheriff’s deputies.
“If we had an internal service, we would also be in a better position to train them for public interaction in a way that’s different than how law enforcement operates,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Passenger rail service between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth will continue for at least another year after a Texas group agreed to chip in millions to keep the route alive, officials said Thursday.
The North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Council on Thursday voted to provide $3.5 million to keep the Heartland Flyer rail service  operational, said Brian Wilson, a spokesperson.
The Amtrak service was slated to shut down on or before Oct. 1 after the Texas Legislature declined to continue funding its share of the 206-mile route.
“This funding lasts for a year,” Wilson said.
Ending the service would have been a tremendous loss for both Oklahoma and Texas, said Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City.
“Tourism is Oklahoma’s third largest industry and a major economic driver for communities across the state,” said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City. “This Amtrak route gives Oklahomans more flexibility when planning their travel and offers Texans a convenient way to see what they’ve been missing just across the border.”
Officials are considering expanding the line into Kansas to connect with other major passenger train routes. Possible closure of the service would have impacted expansion plans.
The service was reestablished in 1999 after ending in 1979.

(Photo via Iowa PBS) Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa and head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for 12 years, said Thursday that Iowa leaders need to look toward “and” conversations rather than “or” discussions to solve some of the state’s biggest issues. 
Vilsack said during a recording of “Iowa Press” that a move to support small and midsized farms would help with water quality issues, concerns around eminent domain and the rural economy. He also spoke about recent cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, USDA staffing and other changes from the Trump administration.
Back in Iowa following the change in administration, Vilsack is now CEO of the World Food Prize in Des Moines, a role he said is a “continuation” of the work he did as U.S. secretary of Agriculture.

The World Food Prize will host the Iowa Hunger Summit July 16, with a focus on the root causes of food insecurity and to raise awareness on the challenges of combating hunger. 
“A challenge that is going to get a little bit more difficult because the federal government has made decisions to sort of take a step back in terms of the assistance that has traditionally been provided,” Vilsack said during the show, recorded at Iowa PBS.
Vilsack said cuts to SNAP in the “big beautiful bill” which was signed into law July 4, is going to “put the onus on the rest of us to step up our game.”

The food assistance program helps about 1 in 12 Iowans, according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The federal bill plans to tighten eligibility requirements and require states to shoulder more of the program costs. 
Vilsack said these changes will have an impact beyond the people who will be without food assistance, as 20 cents of every SNAP dollar spent at the grocery store goes back to farmers.  
“So when you cut SNAP, you’re also cutting farm income,” Vilsack said. 
The Democrat from Mount Pleasant said it will also have a “rippling” impact on other jobs in the food chain, and the state budget.
Migrant workers and immigration policy
During his recent visit to the Iowa State Fairgrounds, President Donald Trump announced planned legislation that would allow farmers to vouch for some of their undocumented workers to let them stay in the country. 
The president said the action was in response to requests of the industry, following his mass deportation efforts, which Vilsack said will have a “profound impact” on farming and food. 
Vilsack also said the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, a federal bill introduced several years ago that has not passed, would have done this by creating a legal pathway for migrant farm workers to “gain legitimacy.”
“I think it’s unlikely that you’re going to see a lot of Americans take these jobs,” Vilsack said. “These are really, really, really tough jobs.”
Vilsack predicts lowered USDA staff morale due to cuts, changes
Vilsack first took office during the Obama administration as secretary of Agriculture and then again during the Biden administration. Both times, he said a survey of USDA staff showed very low morale at the start of those administrations. 
“I think you’ll probably see some significant impacts in terms of morale,” Vilsack said. “Elections have consequences, and every administration has the right to do what they think is best for the country and for the workers. 
“But the reality is, you can reduce the workforce, but you have to do it strategically and thoughtfully.” 
Congress plans to scrap USDA Climate Hubs, following Trump guidance 

More than 15,000 USDA employees have taken a federal buy-out program offered by the government following threats of office restructuring, and in some cases, staff were terminated and then brought back on. The Trump administration has said many of these roles were probationary positions. Some of the firings across the federal workforce were challenged in a lawsuit, but the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in favor of the Trump administration’s layoffs. 
“If you’re looking at wholesale reductions and massive reductions at one time, that makes it hard on those who are left,” Vilsack said. “They end up having to do two or three jobs, and at the end of the day, that’s pretty hard to do.” 
No more ‘get big or get out’ mentality in ag
Vilsack said there’s a “tendency” in the country to think that “every farmer is essentially like every other farmer” which he said is not true. 
Vilsack said there are large-scale farms which represent roughly 10% of all farms, get around 85% of all agricultural income and nearly 60% of farm subsidies. He said the other 90% of small, to midsized farms share what’s left of the market and subsidies. 
He said this contributes to the declining number of farms and the difficulty farmers have to make ends meet. 
“It’s a massive erosion of the basic economic unit of rural America, and I think the department, the federal government, has a responsibility to address that issue,” Vilsack said. 
Earlier this spring, Vilsack spoke with farmers near Indianola, at an event sponsored by Iowa Democrats, about his idea that the farm, rather than the farmer, should work harder.  
He shared the same idea Thursday, noting that certain forms of manure management or the climate smart commodities program could help a farm generate multiple streams of income. 
“And it shouldn’t be that the strategy in farming is you have to get big or get out,” Vilsack said to reporters. 
During his time at USDA, Vilsack championed the climate smart agriculture programs which incentivized and helped create markets for farmers who utilized sustainable farming practices. The Trump administration has canceled part of this program, the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, which it labeled as a “Biden-era climate slush fund.”
In a conversation with reporters following the taping of the show, Vilsack said the challenge will be to “keep the concept going” in the country and to have farmers experience “some success” with being paid for sustainably produced commodities. 
“This is going to continue — the challenge will be at what pace,” Vilsack said. “And we obviously need to accelerate the pace in terms of the challenges to the environment and the ag economy — I hope that we do that.”
Water quality in Iowa 
A recent report from Polk County tagged agricultural activities as the leading source of nitrate pollution in Iowa’s Des Moines and Raccoon rivers as they enter Des Moines. 
Vilsack said he believes there is “definitely” a role for the federal government to play in solving the issue. 
“We keep looking at this as an either-or circumstance, and I think the challenge, and the opportunity, is that we need to look at it as an ‘and’ proposition,” Vilsack said. “How do you essentially deal with the nitrate issue, at the same time understand the important role of agriculture?” 
Vilsack said it also fits with his idea of supporting small and midsized farmers by building extra, on-farm revenue sources via manure management strategies like an anaerobic digester. This, he said, would reduce land application of manure, which would help the nitrate levels in the river, and support farmers in their operations. 
He said solutions like that need to be supported with funding for research and economic development opportunities. 
“I think our policymakers, our politicians, have to start thinking in terms of ‘and,’” He said. “We are a country now that is thinking in terms of ‘or,’ and that stymies — it essentially freezes us — from creative thought and creative solutions.” 
Eminent domain
Vilsack said the same approach should be used for the issue of eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines. 
“How can we have a sustainable aviation industry and the hundreds of thousands of job opportunities that it can create, and the better income for farmers it can create, and at the same time, how can we respect the needs and challenges that farms have, and families have, about their land,” he told reporters.
Vilsack said policy makers need to step back and ask: “Why is it that we have this issue? Why do people feel as strongly as they do about all of this?” 
Vilsack said the reason is that Iowa hasn’t been growing, supporting the midsized farming economy or working to keep Iowans in Iowa. 
“We have to move towards agriculture,” Vilsack said. “We have to create more revenue streams for farmers, we have to create more ways for that farm to work harder and smarter and more profitably.”
Vilsack also spoke with reporters about the response from the current administration to the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 174.8 million birds since the current outbreak began in February 2022. 
He said Ag Secretary Brooke Rollins’ five-pronged, $1 billion plan to combat the bird flu was “really not a change in what we did before.” 
Vilsack said the industry really needs a usable vaccine, and said he believes “eventually it will get worked out.”
Iowa Press is hosted by O. Kay Henderson and featured Brianne Pfannenstiel of the Des Moines Register and Erin Murphy of The Gazette in Cedar Rapids. The episode with Vilsack is scheduled to air Friday at 7:30 p.m.

Members of the Michigan Public Service Commission on Thursday approved applications to construct two approximately 50 mile spans of high-voltage electric transmission lines from the Indiana border starting in Branch County to a substation in Calhoun County, and another stretching from Eaton County to Gratiot County.
The projects, proposed by ITC Holding Corp., doing business as Michigan Electric Transmission Company, have been controversial because residents expressed dismay over the lack of public input on the projects and the fact that their concerns regarding routes went largely unheard. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Some of the properties in the approved routes run through legacy farm land, and residents are concerned about their property values dipping due to the lines and pending construction activity.
An attorney working with residents also told Michigan Advance that the company, in an attempt to acquire land prior to pending eminent domain proceedings, has been offering landowners raw deals with few property rights or just compensation.
That said, the projects would usher in the first major Michigan electric transmission line projects in more than a decade, and the commission on Thursday said the need was evident. 
Commissioners also gave the company directives on how to move forward with both projects, but with parameters for including public-proposed route modifications as it prepared for construction.
In approving the lines, all three members of the Michigan Public Service Commission expressed disappointment in the way the company behind the project handled public engagement.

“In the case before us, I believe it would be generous to call METC’s public engagement lackluster,” Commissioner Kathrine Peretick said. “We heard from impacted parties that METC refused to answer simple questions, ignored glaringly obvious routing problems, like an airport in the path of the transmission line, and took the easy, lazy path for the siting of the route in every place possible. All of this is more egregious in the context that METC is a well-resourced company that has the ability and the means to do better.”
In a statement provided to the Advance, a company spokesperson said it appreciated the commission’s approval.
“We also take seriously the Commission’s concerns regarding public engagement,” a spokesperson said. “We recognize that meaningful community involvement is essential to the success of these projects, and we are committed to refining our outreach process moving forward.”
Projects approved with some changes
In the company’s initial request, it proposed a 39-mile line between substations in Gratiot and Eaton counties, and a 55-mile line between Calhoun and Branch counties. Both transmission projects are described as double circuit 345 kilovolt lines.
Proposed and alternate routes were submitted for both projects.
On Thursday, the commission approved the alternative route for the Gratiot to Eaton project, while also approving the proposed route for the Calhoun and Branch project.
The commission found that the alternative route for the Gratiot to Eaton project was reasonable and preferable because it had fewer heavy angles and road crossings, impacted fewer wetlands and hydric soils, and used a long-standing utility right of way.
For the Calhoun to Branch lines, the proposed route was chosen for similar reasons. 
The alternative route would have avoided impacting the R & R Ranch Airport in Marshall, which was a concern cited across multiple meetings by owner Robert Williams. However, the proposed route would have resulted in more damage to archeological sites, increased the number residences within 500 feet of the line’s right of way and expanded the number of parcels crossed by the line.

Overall, both lines were found to be necessary additions to Michigan’s electric infrastructure because they would ensure increased energy reliability, capacity and opportunities for renewable energy integration. Neither project will present threats to public health and safety, and although there will be some environmental disturbances, approval of both projects was permissible under the Michigan Environmental Protection Act because there were no feasible or prudent alternatives.
Going forward, the company must consider landowners’ specific requests for minor modifications to the major transmission line routes, and the commission directed the company to file a memorandum in the case detailing how impacted landowners may submit minor route modification requests. 
The company must also file a monthly report documenting any minor modification requests, how it accommodated the request, or why it was unable to do so.
Commissioners mandated that the company must provide landowners along the approved routes, as well as adjacent landowners, with contact information so that they can communicate concerns to the company. 
The commission also required the company to file separate monthly reports detailing the communications received from landowners as well as investigate every noise complaint received by landowners to ensure there is not a system issue that needs to be addressed. 
Commissioners call METC onto the carpet over public engagement
Many of the conditions were a direct result of the company’s “lackluster” work, as noted by Peretick, in notifying residents of the plans and the few opportunities for public input that would have allowed resident concerns to be heard and reflected in project changes.
Peretick said she was bound to issue an affirmative vote on the projects because the construction applications met the requirements of statute.
But in her mind, Act 30 of 1995, which outlines guidelines for electric transmission line siting, sets the bar too low for companies and doesn’t give landowners an adequate opportunity to shape the outcome.
Notably, Peretick said Act 30 only requires official notice to landowners directly on routes proposed by a company, and leaves out adjacent properties or those in the general study area where intervenors may propose alternative routes. Although the act theoretically allows the commission to approve one of those intervenor-proposed routes, that would mean approving a route on land with owners who were never notified.
“I cannot in good conscience approve a transmission line to be built on someone’s property that was never even given a chance to argue their side of the case,” Peretick said.
The low bar of landowner public engagement was another issue with Act 30 that Peretick said needed to be addressed.
Commission Chair Dan Scripps said he didn’t want it to get lost in the shuffle that the transmission lines were a significant addition to Michigan’s energy infrastructure.
Still, the commission was well aware of the potential impacts to land owners, much like Williams and his airport.
“Even as I’m pleased to see these critical projects move forward, I would implore the company to do a much better job of public engagement in future applications,” Scripps said.
Changes coming to Act 30 guidelines
To bring greater clarity to the process and ensure that landowners were not treated in the same way again, the commission also approved an order that directed staff to develop voluntary filing guidelines for applicants under Act 30. 
The commission voted unanimously to jumpstart that process as a way to address concerns about Act 30’s lack of clarity on what constitutes an alternative route, to what degree private benefits need to be estimated in advance of a project, and whether the law provides for sufficient and clear interaction between an applicant and a landowner.
Commissioner Alessandra Carreon, whose term expires this month, said that although several people submitted individual comments on the project, they were not considered part of the official record and couldn’t be used as a basis for the commission’s decision. Carreon said that was one part of the larger issue with the process.
“However, the upcoming rule making will serve as a critical channel for the public to help shape future Act 30 applications and outcomes,” Carreon said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/transmission-lines-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Getty Images)The state Department of Education is looking to take over the Marlboro County School District’s finances following a contentious budgeting process, the agency said Thursday.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver also asked the state inspector general to investigate claims of mismanaged purchasing cards, according to a letter she sent Thursday. The letter did not include any more information on the potentially suspicious purchases.
A financial takeover is not the same as a total district takeover, since the local school board would keep its other decision-making powers. The move will need approval from the state Board of Education to take effect. The next board meeting is Aug. 5.
If approved, state officials will be able to change the district’s budget, review hiring decisions, pay vendors and manage spending, according to the agency. If that doesn’t improve matters, the state department could move for full control and fire the school board.
SC takes control of rural school district’s finances

“Our highest priority is ensuring students in Marlboro County have access to a safe, stable, and effective educational environment,” Weaver said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the district’s fiscal condition leaves us no choice but to act.”
Facing a nearly $7 million shortfall in the 3,100-student district’s annual budget, school board members and staff suggested raising local property taxes and consolidating schools operating under capacity, “neither of which resulted in a viable or timely solution,” Weaver wrote in a Thursday letter to the state Board of Education’s chairwoman.
Nearly 88% of the district’s students live in poverty. The district received more than $18,000 per student last school year, with about 11% of that coming from federal aid and 56% coming from the state, according to the latest estimates from the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Department of Education officials met with district leaders June 30 and sent a letter a week later expressing the urgency of passing a balanced budget. The department pointed to an increase in staffing numbers despite a decrease in student enrollment and suggested better aligning the two by laying off unnecessary staff members, Weaver wrote.
The school board adopted a budget Wednesday, more than a week after the state’s deadline to do so. That plan would use nearly all of the district’s funds to cover the shortfall, Weaver wrote.
“This outcome, despite extended support and engagement, signals a lack of long-term financial planning and raises serious concerns about the District’s fiscal sustainability,” Weaver wrote. “It also demonstrates that without further intervention, the District may be unable to maintain essential services or restore financial stability.”
The district has been on a fiscal watch, the lowest of three escalating tiers at a state level, on an alternating basis for three of the past five years, Weaver wrote.
Weaver declared a fiscal emergency in the district in February over concerns with the findings in the district’s 2023 financial report. The district failed to submit its most recent report, which would have been due Dec. 1, Weaver wrote in a letter to the school board.
“We welcome the help they are offering us,” said board chair Michael Coachman. He declined to comment further, including on the request to the inspector general.
A district spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Legislators whose districts include the county called the takeover unfortunate but necessary to make sure students in the district are getting the best education possible.
“We owe it to the students and taxpayers of Marlboro County to act responsibly,” freshman Sen. JD Chaplin, a Darlington Republican whose district includes all of Marlboro County, said in a statement.
Rep. Jason Luck, R-Bennettsville, said the $1,500 increases in the state budget for teachers’ salaries need to “mean real results for students.” Marlboro County is among districts that pay teachers no more than the state-set minimums.
“Local control is a cornerstone of our community, and the people of Marlboro County deserve a voice in their schools,” said Luck, a freshman legislator who represents most of Marlboro County. “Still, if the Department of Education’s action is needed to put children first, I pray it is both successful and short-lived.”
Long-time Rep. Jackie “Coach” Hayes, a Dillon Democrat, also gave his support: “The students, teachers, and staff deserve the best and I am glad to partner with the Department to make this happen,” said the retired high school football coach in the neighboring county, who represents the McColl corner of Marlboro County.
State officials took control of Jasper County School District’s finances in December after the district failed to turn in multiple years of financial audits on time, putting federal funding in jeopardy.
Allendale and Williamsburg school districts remain under total control, which can happen if a district consistently receives scores of “unsatisfactory” on its annual report cards, if its accreditation is denied, or if the superintendent decides the district’s turnaround plan is insufficient, according to state law.
Williamsburg County’s local board is moving away from total control. The board, with oversight from the state education department, is searching for a superintendent to replace the one appointed by the state when it assumed control in 2022. That comes after the board got limited decision-making authority back last year.
Allendale County remains under complete control, with no clear timeline as to when local leaders might be able to make decisions again.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/education-savings-1-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A man accused of emailing a death threat to the Queer Straight Alliance at Montana State University and sending vulgar images and slurs to a fellow student pleaded guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Missoula.
Rex Wu, 23, pleaded guilty in a plea agreement to felony cyberstalking with the intent to harass or intimidate. He admitted he caused or meant to cause “substantial emotional distress.”
The felony carries a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
In federal court in Missoula, U.S. Magistrate Judge Kathleen DeSoto told Wu she believed a jury of his peers would find him guilty given the evidence the government had collected against him.
As part of the agreement, Wu will give up a number of electronic devices and pay restitution, with the amount to be determined at sentencing.
Sentencing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 6, at the Russell Smith Federal Courthouse in Missoula.
The court hearing helps bring to a close at least one part of a disturbing chapter at Montana’s largest public university.
  Rex Wu testifies at a Montana Board of Regents meeting in 2023. (Screenshot of video testimony)
In spring 2023, the Queer Straight Alliance reported email threats, but members of the club that supports LGBTQ+ students and others told the Board of Regents and the Daily Montanan they felt the administration fell short in responding to their safety concerns.
In October 2023, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights informed MSU it was under investigation for discrimination for “failing to respond appropriately” to the threats and reports of harassment based on sex, race, color and national origin.
The Office for Civil Rights eventually opened six investigations into alleged abuses, and an MSU spokesperson confirmed Thursday the investigations remain open and pending.
MSU declined to comment on the court case.
The emails Wu pleaded guilty to sending spurred some, although not all, of the 20 reports of discrimination students sent to the Office for Civil Rights.
One of the emails sent to the QSA before a dance party in Bozeman and read aloud in court Wednesday said this in part: “If you do not call off your grooming party of young children tonight, we will send someone to the Rialto and send everyone present to an early death in hell.”
Another one referred to the QSA’s “satanic ways” and said this: “True Montanans will not stop until we expel all the groomers and colored people from our campus and great state!”
In the federal court case, Wu also admitted to harassing an MSU student, Alexandra Lin, who brought attention on campus to the threats against QSA and other unrelated discrimination incidents.
Lin confirmed to the Daily Montanan that she is the victim identified as “Student 1” in court records.
One email to Lin, also read aloud in court, had a subject line “killing the ch–k.” Lin is part Taiwanese.
“Hi Ch–-k I have people watching your house day and night,” the email said. “One of these days you will get what’s coming to you. This isn’t Missoula in real Montana we kill g–ks like you.”
Wu also sent pornographic images and videos to Lin, according to court records.
On campus, however, Wu presented himself as aligned with Lin.
Wu helped Lin plan an “Anti-Hate Teach-In” at MSU, according to court records. Wu served as president of the Chinese Culture Club at MSU and testified about the increase of hate crimes on college campuses to the Montana Board of Regents.
He sent the threatening emails using an encrypted email service, ProtonMail, according to court records. An FBI investigation traced the accounts and IP addresses to Wu, who admitted in an interview to sending harassing emails.
In court, Wu stood in front of the judge with his lawyer as Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Weldon read the emails that were part of the evidence the government had gathered. Wu kept one hand over his forehead for much of the time Weldon read the messages.
He ignored a request for comment after the court hearing.
Wu attended MSU until 2023, he said in court. As a condition of his release, Judge DeSoto said Wu would be generally restricted to the northern district of Illinois without explicit and advanced permission to travel.
The Queer Straight Alliance could not be reached for comment on Thursday morning.
In a phone call after the hearing, Lin said she is pleased Wu pleaded guilty. However, she said it’s unfortunate that so few women who are stalked get to see the same result.
Starting this summer, a new president, Brock Tessman, is leading MSU, and Lin said she hopes the culture will change under him. She said MSU administrators and campus police failed to take her concerns seriously.
“You wonder how many people have these experiences and didn’t get help because it didn’t align with the university’s public image,” Lin said.
Former MSU President Waded Cruzado retired in June after 15 years leading the flagship. She earned accolades for significant increases in enrollment and research spending, but criticism from some students and faculty for a controlling leadership style and failing to address safety concerns on campus.
An MSU spokesperson declined to comment on the work of its campus law enforcement.
At the time the emails were sent to the QSA, MSU maintained it investigated the messages and found they did not represent actual danger to students.
Lin said the most disturbing outcome remains the trauma of believing Wu was her friend, and later finding out he was not only the source of harassment, but he helped organize an event to support the people he victimized.
Even days after he signed his plea deal, Lin said, he was still sending her messages. She said she wonders when she meets new people if she can feel safe.
“More than anything, the most upsetting thing through this experience was the lasting emotional and mental impact of being stalked,” Lin said.
Lin also said the guilty plea is a “huge weight lifted off my shoulders.”
“I feel inspired to help out others going through this. I signed up to phone bank and volunteer at a crisis helpline for victims,” she said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0139-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-10 18:21:00.471697

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Measles cases have surpassed a recent 2019 record to reach the highest level since 1992, with at least 1,289 cases reported in 39 states.
The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Measles cases are in 34 states with North Dakota now the focus

Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)The Sierra Club announced Thursday that it has broken the world record for the largest display of origami fish in an effort to bring attention to Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline, which passes through northern Wisconsin and Michigan. 
Line 5 has been the target of sustained activism for years, with environmental groups and Native American tribes arguing the pipeline’s continued existence puts the water supply for thousands of residents at risk.
By next year, Enbridge, the Canadian company that owns the pipeline, must reroute a part of the pipeline that runs through a portion of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa tribe’s reservation. As the company works through the permit process for moving the pipeline, the tribe and environmental groups have pushed the state Department of Natural Resources and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers not to approve the permits. 
The tribe says the pipeline’s continued operation, even if it no longer runs across tribal land, will harm water quality in the watershed, encourage the growth of invasive species and damage wetlands, diminishing their ability to filter pollutants out of runoff before reaching surface waters.

At a two-day hearing in May, tribal members testified against the Army Corps’ approval of the permit. A series of hearings are set to be held from August-October on a challenge to the DNR’s permitting decision. 
The Sierra Club organized the origami fish project to  bring attention to the years of activism against Line 5 and the continued fight against its path through the Bad River reservation and under the Straits of Mackinac between Michigan’s upper and lower peninsulas. 
The Trump Administration, as part of its effort to increase production of oil and other fossil fuels, has expedited permit approval of a new pipeline tunnel in Michigan.
The previous origami fish record was 18,303. With the help of folders from all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, the Sierra Club has created a display of more than 70,000 origami fish. On Thursday, the fish were put on display in the Sierra Club of Wisconsin’s Madison office as staff continued pinning them onto boards. A press conference about Line 5’s effect on Wisconsin’s water was held in front of the boards full of paper fish. 
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) told the Wisconsin Examiner the fish project was a symbol of people’s ability to work together to fight injustice. 
“You topple regimes with people power,” she said.
Hong added that even if the Line 5’s permits are approved, the “fight to protect water has renewed energy” because of it. 
Despite the years of activism and push for the DNR not to approve the permits, there is little the department can do to stop the project. The DNR’s authority is limited so that if the proposed project fits within state laws, the permits must be approved, something that Hong said needs to be changed.
“We certainly have to look at amending those laws and holding polluters responsible, not compromising hundreds, thousands of people’s drinking water for tens or hundreds of jobs,” she said. 
The fish display will be available to view at the Urban Ecology Center in Milwaukee on Saturday.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Ethics Commission on Thursday voted to settle an ethics case with a former agency head and state Cabinet secretary accused of violating conflict of interest rules.
While the details of the case being settled or the terms of the agreement with Shelley Zumwalt, former Cabinet secretary of tourism, wildlife and heritage for Gov. Kevin Stitt, were not public as of Thursday afternoon, the Commission’s Executive Director Lee Anne Bruce Boone said those will be released once it is signed and executed. 
Zumwalt also previously led the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation and the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. She resigned as head of the Department of Tourism in September following a scathing state audit. 
Zumwalt was required to complete annual forms attesting that no related party transactions existed, and she checked “no” on the forms, according to the audit.
“I want to acknowledge the collaborative efforts of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission and Attorney General’s Office to achieve this outcome,” Zumwalt said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice Thursday afternoon. “Neither my husband nor I financially benefited from the contracts, and there was no finding by the ethics commission of any financial gain.”
Additional Ethics Commission action 
In other business, the Commission on Thursday also voted to pursue an ethics case against the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission in district court and open another formal investigation into state Rep. Ajay Pittman, D-Oklahoma City. 
At the Commission’s June meeting, the board voted to pursue an ethics complaint in district court against Pittman for allegedly violating the terms of a settlement agreement. 
Pittman had agreed to reimburse a total of $35,000 after failing to maintain proper records, improperly withdrawing funds, and using campaign funds for personal use. The Commission alleged she missed payments, leading the Commission to pursue the case in Oklahoma County District Court, Bruce Boone told Oklahoma Voice in June. 
No case had been filed as of Thursday. 
Because of the breach of the settlement agreement and “other reporting inconsistencies,” the Ethics Commission voted to further audit Pittman’s campaign committee’s reporting and transition a complaint into a formal investigation, according to a document made public by the Commission Thursday. 
Pittman did not immediately return a message seeking comment Thursday afternoon. 
The Ethics Commission also voted unanimously to pursue in district court a separate ethics case against the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission for alleged violations of financial disclosure rules. 
The Ethics Commission said it has been actively investigating the PAC for campaign finance violations for several months, according to a document made public Thursday.
Anthony DeVore, president of the political action committee, did not immediately return a message left seeking comment Thursday. 
DeVore’s group has lobbied at the state Capitol to reduce criminal penalties for cockfighting.

Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed bills cutting taxes on capital gains and diapers and increasing fees for motor vehicle registrations. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Missouri investors will get a tax break when they take profits and motorists will pay more to renew vehicle registrations under separate bills signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
Kehoe’s signature on the bill granting an income tax exemption for long-term capital gains — profits on investments held for a year or longer — marks the third major tax cut in the past three years. And it comes just days after he vetoed more than $300 million in general revenue spending and restricted $211 million more amid worries about sluggish revenues.
In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the state took in $13.4 billion in general revenue and final figures show revenue increased just $1 million over the previous year. After Kehoe’s vetoes, the budget for the current fiscal year projects spending $15.5 billion in general revenue, with the gap between revenue and spending covered by surpluses accumulated in past years.
“Conservative leadership is about keeping more money in the hands of Missouri families, and less in government coffers,” Kehoe said in a news release.
The capital gains exemption for individuals is officially estimated to reduce revenue by about $110 million annually. Independent economists, however, have warned that the annual revenue loss could be much more, perhaps as much as $600 million. 
Most of the benefits from a cut in the capital gains rate for individuals would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal returns filed for 2022 with incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but included 65% of the capital gains income.
When Kehoe finished with the state budget, he warned he was making vetoes and restricting spending because of uncertainty in future state revenues and expenses.
When Kehoe released his budget proposal in January, it anticipated the state would end the current fiscal year with an unobligated general revenue balance of $2.6 billion. At that time, the unobligated surplus at the end of the coming fiscal year was projected at $1.4 billion, but during the recent special session state Budget Director Dan Haug told lawmakers he expects no more than half that amount — $600 million to $700 million — will remain on June 30, 2026.
“The Office of Administration’s Division of Budget and Planning estimates a nearly $1 billion shortfall in general revenue starting in (fiscal year 2027),” the release accompanying the budget actions stated. “Contributing to this shortfall, ongoing general revenue spending authorized in the (fiscal year 2026) budget is projected to outpace ongoing revenues by nearly over $1 billion and grow larger in future years.”
Both the vetoes and Haug’s forecast came before Congress finished work on the massive federal budget reconciliation bill signed July 4 by President Donald Trump. The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimated Missouri revenue would decline by at least $170 million and possibly by more than $400 million under an earlier version of the bill. 
That estimate has not been updated since the final bill was passed.
The federal budget bill is also expected to shift billions of dollars in costs for programs like food stamps and Medicaid to Missouri over the coming decade.
The liberal Missouri Budget Project, which opposed the tax cut during the session, issued a statement Thursday condemning Kehoe’s decision to sign the bill.
“Prioritizing an expensive special interest tax giveaway at this time is irresponsible and a mismanagement of taxpayer dollars,” CEO Amy Blouin said in a news release. “It’s also a slap in the face to the bulk of Missouri taxpayers who are struggling to afford groceries and who already pay a higher portion of their income in state and local taxes than do the folks who will get a windfall from the capital gains exemption.”
A capital gains exemption for corporations, also included in the bill, would take effect when future revenue growth or legislative action reduces the top individual income tax rate to 4.5% or below. The rate this year is 4.7%, with two reductions of 0.1 percentage point each already included in state law when revenue triggers are met.
The state budget office estimates the earliest date for the next rate cut triggered by revenue would be Jan. 1, 2028.
 Other tax cuts

The bill that includes the capital gains tax cut also includes provisions increasing a refundable income tax credit used by lower-income senior citizens and the disabled to offset property taxes. The increase in what is known as the Circuit Breaker tax credit would bump the maximum credit for homeowners to $1,550 from the current $1,100. Qualifying taxpayers who rent their homes would see their maximum credit increase to $1,055 from $750.
The maximum income for claiming the credit would also increase, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 a year for homeowners.
The increased Circuit Breaker credit was negotiated by Democrats opposed to the capital gains cut. A bipartisan coalition also won sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products, bringing the total official estimate of the tax cut in the coming year to $430 million, with an ongoing revenue reduction of $340 million.
 Registration fees

The Missouri Department of Revenue issues motor vehicle registrations and driver’s licenses through a system of contract offices that make money through fees, set by law, added to the state charge for the transaction. 
There is supposed to be at least one license office in every county, but for much of this year, five counties have had no office because contractors wouldn’t work for the allowed fees.
The bill signed by Kehoe and sponsored by state Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, would increase the fees received by the license offices by 50%.
The goal is to make the offices attractive to contractors and avoid closures, Crawford said during a House committee hearing in April.
“I live in a small town, and if my license bureau were to close, I would likely have to drive 45 minutes, take a half a day to drive and get my license,” Crawford said. “And so I would much rather pay $3 than take off half a day and drive 45 miles or 45 minutes to get this done.”
The transaction fee for a driver’s license or motor vehicle would go from $6 to $9 for the shortest period and from $12 to $18 for the longest, six years for a driver’s license and two years for a vehicle registration.
In fiscal 2024, the 175 license offices processed almost 9 million transactions and charged $58.4 million in fees. 
The smallest, in Unionville in Putnam County on the Iowa border, generated $28,736 in fees on 4,519 transactions. There is currently no contractor for the Unionville office and it has been closed since mid-April.
The busiest license office is in Creve Coeur in St. Louis County, where 167,390 transactions generated almost $1.1 million in fee revenue.

Mike Kehoe.
The new benefit, linked to an increase in the minimum wage passed with 58% of the vote in November, became a target for business lobbying interests. Republican allies in the General Assembly pushed it to Kehoe’s desk by invoking a rarely used state Senate rule to shut down debate over Democratic objections.
The action followed a pattern established over the past 15 years where conservative Republicans have used their majorities in the legislature to roll back or repeal measures that became law through initiatives pushed to the ballot by progressive groups.
The minimum wage initiative was a statutory change, meaning lawmakers could make any changes that would command a majority. 
In a news release issued after he signed the bills, Kehoe said he was approving the bill to defend small businesses.
“Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work—families, job creators, and small business owners—by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,” Kehoe said in the release.
Missouri House Democratic leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City denounced Kehoe’s decision to sign the bill as an attack on workers and voters.
“The governor’s action today demonstrates the absolute disdain Republicans have for working Missourians,” Aune said in a news release. “But in stripping workers of their legal right to earned sick leave, the governor and his allies have probably guaranteed this issue will be back on the ballot next year as a constitutional amendment that will place worker protections beyond their reach.”
Richard Von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs with Justice, the organization that helped lead the campaign for the paid sick leave law, has filed a proposed constitutional amendment targeting the 2026 ballot.
The repeal doesn’t take effect immediately because Republicans were unable to muster the two-thirds majorities needed to pass an emergency clause even though the GOP holds more than two-thirds of the seats in each chamber. It goes into effect at the same time as other bills approved this year and signed by Kehoe.
The increased minimum wage, $13.75 an hour, took effect on Jan. 1. A second increase is set for Jan. 1, 2026, when it will increase to $15 an hour. The bill signed Thursday also repeals a provision, in effect since 2006, to adjust the minimum wage annually for inflation.
Organizers of the initiative that put the measure on the ballot set May 1 as the starting date for paid leave, available for personal illness or to stay home with a sick family member. The intent was to allow more time for businesses to adjust to the new rule than the short period between the election and the new year.
Workers at businesses with receipts greater than $500,000 a year are accruing at least one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Employers with fewer than 15 workers must allow workers to earn at least 40 hours per year, with larger employers mandated to allow at least 56 hours.
The measure made sick leave guaranteed for 728,000 workers who lacked it statewide, or over 1 in 3 Missouri workers, according to an analysis from the progressive nonprofit the Missouri Budget Project.
The leave can be used currently, but the repeal makes it uncertain if accrued leave can be used after the law is repealed.
The battle over the leave provisions revolved around its economic effect, pitting business interests and their backers in the legislature against supporters of the law. 
During a House committee hearing in February, the sponsor, Republican state Rep. Sherri Gallick of Belton, suggested that employees can’t be trusted to use paid sick leave only for the reasons allowed by the law.
“Under the mandated sick leave, potential abuse is nearly impossible to address,” Gallick told the House Commerce Committee. “Employers cannot ask an employee why they were absent, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits for merely inquiring.”
In a news release Thursday, Kara Corches, president and CEO of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called the mandated paid sick leave a “job killer.”
“Missouri employers value their employees and recognize the importance of offering competitive wages and benefits, but one-size-fits-all mandates threaten growth,” Corches said in the release.
At a May news conference, state Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said that when Missouri workers are successful, businesses will succeed.
“The idea that providing workers with more protections is a business killer is wild,” she said. “…To try to make this seem like this is something that will kill business, that will keep businesses from opening, I think it’s absurd, and I think it’s quite disappointing, and I think it sends absolutely the wrong message.”
The action on sick leave is similar to a bill in 2011 weakening provisions of a ballot measure from 2010 called the “Puppy Mill Cruelty and Prevention Act,” that specified appropriate living conditions for breeding operations and including action this year to overturn the abortion rights amendment approved in November. 
The GOP’s willingness to overturn voter actions has led many initiative organizers to push their proposals as constitutional amendments, which require a statewide vote to repeal or revise. Amendments to legalize marijuana, expand Medicaid coverage, revise the legislative redistricting process and protect abortion rights have all been passed as constitutional amendments.
The Republican majority has responded by successfully pushing a second revision of redistricting and placing an abortion rights repeal on the 2026 ballot. A court challenge to Medicaid expansion was rejected by the Missouri Supreme Court.

(Rendering courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)The University of Northern Iowa is considering community wishes and studying successful development projects as it takes its first steps in creating its own mixed-use area to benefit both campus and the Cedar Valley area, university officials say.
The Cedar Falls university has launched the Panther District project with a search for a developer to help transform land close to UNI athletics and events centers into a pedestrian, bike and family-friendly space with restaurants, retail spaces and housing options.
Pete Moris, UNI director of university relations, said in an interview one of the goals behind the district is to boost already-growing development and provide additional amenities on the west side of Cedar Falls, benefiting both the city and the college.
“We did not want to compete with downtown or Cedar Falls if this project was simply going to draw dollars from one area to a different area,” Moris said. “We wanted to be able to help infuse Cedar Falls with a project that would benefit the entire community.”

The development will sit across the street from the UNI-Dome and McLeod Center, which hosts athletic and other events. UNI will continue owning the land where the development will be, according to the project website, with the developer leasing it to “implement, finance, operate, and maintain” the structures within the district.
As the project is still in its early stages, Moris said an official design of the district has not been decided upon, but the university and developer will work together on options once a company is selected. Once a developer is selected, Moris said the university will seek necessary approvals from the Iowa Board of Regents.
Aspects of the district the university wants to see put in place include restaurants, temporary lodging, housing and retail businesses, with open spaces to invite people in and bring UNI, growing neighborhoods in the area and the recently built high school closer together.
“Right now we’ve kind of got an idea, but I think that pedestrian, bike friendly, family friendly … those are elements we do feel pretty strongly about to anchor the project,” Moris said.
Housing for the project would be market-rate and aimed at people who work in the area, Moris said.
The consulting firm hired to determine whether a project like the Panther District could be viable had previous experience working with downtown Cedar Falls, Moris said. The firm found that with projected population growth and tourism, the city would be able to handle the district without fears of hurting or shuttering other businesses.

Katy Susong, president and CEO of Grow Cedar Valley, said the College Hill District that sits a few minutes away from the proposed development space could also see further investment and development, leading to general improvements to the whole area.
Excitement for more development can be found across the Cedar Valley region, Susong said, as well as a readiness for the community to be more closely tied to the college.
“I think this is a tremendous opportunity to really create an inviting corridor into Cedar Falls that shows all of the great things we have going on, but demonstrates that we are Panther Town,” Susong said. “We are a college community, and hopefully this development will make that abundantly clear.”
Grow Cedar Valley has had conversations with university staff about plans for the project, and Susong said there should be “opportunities to work together in meaningful ways” in the future as the process moves forward.
Other resources UNI has tapped in the creation of the proposed district include similar projects that have seen success, including Titletown in Green Bay, Wis. The community development, which boasts housing, a health clinic, restaurants, entertainment and a large park, was also scrutinized by Iowa State University in the early development of its multi-use district, CyTown, Iowa State University Research Park President Rick Sanders said.
Moris said UNI has looked at the CyTown project to see if there were any takeaways that could be applied to the Panther District, and Sanders said it looks like “they’re starting the process wonderfully.” He saw similarities between the two projects when he perused the Panther District Request for Qualifications, and he would be happy to work with the fellow Iowa institution to share what he’s learned.
In addition to ensuring partnerships are made and kept between the city and business communities, advice Sanders gave to the UNI staff working on the district is to make sure processes and people are prepared to face challenges, including when the university has to operate outside of its regular practices.
“The university is fantastic at doing what the university does, but this is not what the university is used to doing,” Sanders said. “So if you try to shoehorn a project like this into traditional university processes, I think you’re going to find some very real challenges.”

Vermont State Police are investigating a suspicious death that occurred in the town of Pittsford.
Police received a call from a resident at a home on Hollister Quarry Road about the death of an individual, and they began the investigation at about 2:10 a.m Wednesday, according to a press release from state police. 
The death is considered suspicious, and the person’s identity has not been released yet. The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington is expected to conduct an autopsy on the victim’s body to determine the cause and manner of death.
The results of the autopsy haven’t been released, and police did not have anyone in custody as of Thursday afternoon. 
Adam Silverman, a spokesperson for Vermont State Police, said he did not have any additional information to release as of 1:30 p.m. Thursday.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)The five Democratic state lawmakers who were denied entrance to inspect the new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades last week filed a lawsuit in the Florida Supreme Court against Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Department of Emergency (FDEM) Management Executive Director Kevin Guthrie on Thursday.
They contend that their exclusion from the facility violated state law as well as the Florida Constitution by eroding the separation of powers and improperly restricting the authority of a co-equal branch of government.
State Sens. Shevin Jones and Carlos Guillermo Smith and state Reps. Michele Rayner, Anna Eskamani, and Angie Nixon are the plaintiffs in the case. The five Democratic lawmakers attempted to enter the facility on July 3, but were denied entrance for what officials there claimed were “safety concerns” that the Democratic lawmakers say were never identified to them.
Their attempt to visit the facility came two days after President Donald Trump, Gov. DeSantis, and several other state Republican officials held a tour and roundtable discussion at the center with members of the media
Officials with FDEM said earlier this week that state statute grants inspection authority only to legislative committees, “not to individual legislators engaging in political theater.” They also said that while Florida Statute 944.23 does authorize members of the Legislature to visit state correctional institutions, they have to be those under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections.
“The Alligator Alcatraz facility is not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and does not otherwise fall within the statutory definition of a ‘state correctional institution,’” said FDEM spokesperson Stephanie Hartman, referring to the appellation given the facility by state leaders.
During the roundtable discussion on July 1 when the facility was opened to the media, Gov. DeSantis described the detention center as a “one-stop shop” with a runway that will allow the federal government to carry out deportation flights. The governor used a state of emergency declaration he issued in January 2023 to take over and begin the speedy construction on the land Miami-Dade County owns.
The five Democrat allege in their lawsuit that under Florida Statutes 944.23 and 951.225, members of the Legislature are explicitly entitled to conduct unannounced visits to any state or local detention facility at their “pleasure.”
They also contend that DeSantis and Guthrie undermined the State Emergency Management Act under which the governor derives his emergency powers. They are seeking a writ to compel DeSantis and and Guthrie “to provide immediate, unannounced access to the Petitioners to the Dade-Collier Training & Transition Airport site of the proclaimed ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention facility.”
The department announced on Wednesday that it will open the center for all state lawmakers and members of Congress this Saturday for a 90-minute visit.
 Reports of poor conditions
The filing of the lawsuit followed news reports of poor conditions at the 3,000 person-capacity tent and trailer detention center. Multiple detainees told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they had gone days without showering, the toilets didn’t flush, and temperatures fluctuated between extremes.
“The rule of law must be upheld,” the lawsuit states.
“Our Constitution does not coronate a king. It is not hyperbolic to contend that the Governor’s actions, directly or indirectly through the actions of agency directors and their employees, could become more far reaching into the third branch of our government. Conjecture is not necessary at this moment because the distinctive and autonomous power of the legislative branch has and is being challenged by and through the executive branch. The blatant, illegal, and cavalier nature of violation of the Florida Constitution and statutory authority puts members of the legislative and judicial branches at risk if we, those sworn to protect and defend the Constitution and rule of law, do not speak out loudly and boldly against its trespasses and transgressors.”
The lawsuit was filed by two Democratic members of the Florida House, attorneys Ashley Gantt and LaVon Bracy Davis. Along with Rep. Rayner, the three female Democratic lawmakers announced last month that they were forming their own law firm called BDGR P.A.
Two environmental groups, Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, have already gone to federal court to sue the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), FDEM, and Miami-Dade County alleging construction of the detention center violates a federal law that requires environmental analysis of potential harms and that the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
The Phoenix has reached out to the governor’s office and FDEM for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-10 20:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,New Canaan case marks victory for affordable housing advocates,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/10/new-canaan-8-30g-weed-street/,A judge ruled that the New Canaan Planning & Zoning Commission improperly denied a proposal to build affordable housing units.,"In a victory for advocates of Connecticut’s affordable housing law, a Superior Court judge last week ruled that the New Canaan Planning & Zoning Commission improperly denied a proposal to build a 102-unit apartment complex that included 31 affordable units.
The 98-page decision refuted concerns commonly raised by opponents of such developments and emphasized that all towns bear some responsibility for meeting housing needs in the state.
The ruling, issued in Superior Court in Hartford, says that the planning and zoning commission must approve the construction after the developer makes a couple of minor tweaks to the proposal to build on Weed Street in New Canaan.
The property is in a residential neighborhood, less than half a mile from the New Canaan train station. It previously had a 10,000-square-foot single-family home and separate pool house, which have been demolished. The current property owner first applied in 2022 to change the zoning and build apartments and made several adjustments to the plan. It was denied in November 2022.
The developer contested the denial under a Connecticut affordable housing law commonly known by its statutory name — 8-30g. That law allows developers whose affordable housing proposals are denied to sue and force local officials to prove that they declined the proposal for health or safety reasons.
Towns are exempt from the law if at least 10% of their housing is designated affordable, and they can apply for temporary reprieves as they make progress toward that goal.
Tim Hollister, the land use attorney who represented developer Arnold Karp, said the town had raised concerns about fire safety, stormwater management and pedestrian safety to deny the application, although the evidence was “very clear” that it should have been approved, he said.
Judge Edward V. O’Hanlan addressed those concerns in detail in his ruling.
“The [New Canaan Planning & Zoning] commission has not met its burden to prove that its denial was necessary to protect these public interests, or that these public interests as identified outweighed the need for affordable housing and could not be protected by reasonable changes to the site plan,” he wrote.
“Why did they [deny the proposal]?” Hollister said. “I think it’s because of the dynamic we see with local zoning, with 169 towns, each having its own zoning power and zoning jurisdiction. The local nature of zoning reinforces the status quo and makes commissions very subject to local opposition. I think it’s almost paralyzing.”
New Canaan’s Planning and Zoning Commission did not respond to requests for comment.
The one-bedroom affordable units in the complex would rent to people with a maximum income of $50,670 who would pay a maximum rent of $1,142, according to court documents. Two-bedroom units would be available for maximum incomes of $55,566 and would rent at $1,370 per month, excluding utilities.
New Canaan, where the median annual household income is $163,355, was granted a moratorium earlier this year that temporarily exempts it from lawsuits under 8-30g. The moratorium, which was issued because the town was making progress in building affordable housing, came after a lengthy court battle with the state. 
The Weed Street case, which began more than two years ago, predated the moratorium.
The decision is victory for affordable housing and 8-30g advocates but comes during a moment of political turmoil for housing policy in Connecticut. 
During the last legislative session, Democratic lawmakers worked with Gov. Ned Lamont’s office to create the most significant reform to Connecticut’s housing law in years. That bill passed, but under pressure from local officials, Lamont sided with Republicans and vetoed the measure.
Democrats say they’ll come back into special session this year to make adjustments to the bill. Lamont’s proposed changes, which are likely to be incorporated in a new bill, include ways to make it easier for towns to achieve 8-30g moratoriums if they build more housing near train and bus stations.
It was controversial among housing advocates who said the measure weakened 8-30g, and Lamont has since said he’s unsure whether he would have supported the decades-old law if it were proposed today.
Hollister said this case shows the importance of the law and is unique in a few ways. Most judges’ decisions in cases like this aren’t as thorough as the ruling issued earlier this month, he said.
“The court decision reaffirms that 8-30g is an important tool,” Hollister said. “It’s a way to overcome exclusionary zoning, but it also shows that it’s a tool to overcome local opposition.”
The decision also refutes at least the idea that an understaffed fire department is a reason to deny affordable housing, which is frequently cited as a factor in arguments opposing affordable housing development, he said.
One of the town’s arguments was that its fire department didn’t have the capacity to fight fires in the multistory building. The developer argued that the town regularly relies on help from nearby fire departments, and the court agreed.
“These choices [to rely on mutual aid] are for the town to make, but not sufficiently tied to legitimate fire safety concerns of the commission, so as to forbid someone’s use of their land, much less to be said to outweigh the need for affordable housing,” the judge’s ruling said.
In one of its briefs, which Hollister said was a newer argument, the commission also said that the amount of affordable housing in nearby cities should be a factor that eases the need and goals to build more affordable housing in New Canaan.
“This argument is antithetical — even repugnant — to the policy reasons behind Connecticut’s affordable housing law,” the judge wrote in a footnote in his ruling. 
“Again, the commission points to no statutory language or case law authority that allows the town, literally, to pawn off its responsibility onto other municipalities, or to claim credit for their greater success in meeting that policy. Indeed, each town or city shares an equal burden.”

Makamy, who was pregnant at the time of her death, is one of four youths  to die under CYFD’s watch since April.
Details about Makamy’s life are scarce at this stage. Foster and adoptive parents, counselors and relatives who knew her did not respond to requests to speak to a reporter for this story.	

This article first appeared on Searchlight New Mexico and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.


Case files obtained by Searchlight show that Makamy was struggling in the weeks before her death. She was upset about having to leave her home community in southeastern New Mexico for foster placements, and was specifically unhappy about being sent to stay in CYFD office buildings, where the department often sends children to sleep when case workers can’t find a suitable foster home. In late April, she was taken from a CYFD office to Springer, a five-and-a-half-hour drive from her hometown of Hobbs. She died there three weeks later. A memorial service was held for Makamy in Hobbs in early June. She leaves behind a boyfriend and at least one sibling.
“She was a couch surfer, she bounced from house to house,” said Randy Pettigrew, a Republican state representative from Lea County who has had access to CYFD documentation on Makany’s case. “She had a multitude of office stays. She was listed as a runaway multiple times” while dealing with significant mental health challenges, he said. At least one of the foster homes she was assigned to was not properly licensed by CYFD, Pettigrew said.

Makamy’s case worker had asked for help finding mental health providers in the area, according to the documents obtained by Searchlight. The documents do not say whether she received those services.
Before taking her life, she wrote “Do not save me” on her arm, the documents say.
CYFD declined to comment on Makany’s death, saying in an email that because the case “is still under active investigation, it would be premature for CYFD to respond at this time.”
The tragedy comes as CYFD faces scathing criticism from state legislators, who say the agency has failed to protect New Mexico’s most vulnerable children. In the most recent session, lawmakers passed several significant bills aimed at increasing oversight and transparency at the agency.
Much of the criticism centers on the agency’s lack of progress in fulfilling promises it made under the 2020 settlement of the Kevin S. lawsuit, a class action suit which claimed the state’s child welfare system was “locking New Mexico’s foster children into a vicious cycle of declining physical, mental and behavioral health.”
As part of that settlement, CYFD agreed to stop housing its foster youth in group settings and to provide them with adequate mental health care. But the department has failed year after year to meet its commitments to those promises, according to independent monitors — failures that were highlighted yet again in an arbitration hearing last week.
Instead, CYFD has continued to house children with serious mental and behavioral health needs in youth homeless shelters and its office buildings, where they have been sexually assaulted, injured by armed guards and exposed to fentanyl and other drugs.
Those placements have been particularly harmful for teenagers like Makamy. A 2022 investigation by Searchlight and ProPublica found that many teens in foster care — a group that CYFD has an especially hard time placing in stable homes — spend their teenage years shuffling between shelters and offices without receiving adequate mental health services. These teenagers experience drastic declines in their mental health amid such instability, often culminating in violent outbursts, suicide attempts and other crises.
In two episodes now, which happened barely a month apart, teenagers who had been repeatedly shuffled through offices and shelters have died by suicide. In April, Jaydun Garcia, a 16-year-old who was beloved by his peers in foster care, took his life at a makeshift home in Albuquerque for youth who lack foster placements. Two other children involved with CYFD, both of them infants, have died since June.
“I’m profoundly sad, we should all be profoundly sad, that we’ve seen two children in state custody take their own lives because they felt so hopeless and so alone,” said Maralyn Beck, executive director of New Mexico Child First Network, a foster care advocacy organization. “I don’t think there’s any problem facing New Mexico that’s more serious, with life-altering consequences, than the crisis that is our child protective services.”
Garcia’s death prompted intense outcry among advocates, attorneys and legislators — as well as an investigation by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez. A spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Justice, the agency overseen by Torrez, said that investigators are currently examining Makany Anderson’s death as well.“We are aware of the recent tragic incident involving a young individual in Springer, New Mexico,” Lauren Rodriguez, chief of staff at the department, said in an email to Searchlight. “Our office is actively reviewing the circumstances surrounding this case. We urge anyone with information about the individual’s history or events leading up to their death to contact the New Mexico Department of Justice.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/searchlight_nm_2-1-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

Ross Ford, R-Broken Arrow, said he plans to conduct further investigations into the reallocation of coverage. 
The Department of Public Safety announced last week that the Oklahoma Highway Patrol will stop providing law enforcement coverage in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City and instead shift resources to areas with the “greatest need” by Nov. 1. Local law enforcement in those cities will bear the responsibility of upholding the law on interstates and highways.
Ford, a former Tulsa Police officer who also serves as chair on the House public safety budget subcommittee, said he opposes “pulling manpower from these densely populated areas.
“There has to be a better way to address the department’s concerns that doesn’t involve putting citizens in danger,” he said in a statement Thursday.
Ford said he worries about increased incidents of driving under the influence and unattended collisions on interstate highways. He said troopers patrolling the highways saves lives, and the city of Tulsa should not have to “address the areas of shortage” left by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol’s absence.
Sarah Stewart, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety, said Thursday that the agency was not commenting further or answering additional questions about the policy change beyond an initial statement released last week announcing the upcoming changes.
Mann said in a statement that local police are already overburdened and under-resourced. 
“Shifting the responsibility of responding to incidents and accidents on interstate highways to local agencies will only exacerbate the serious challenges they already face,” he said.
Mann said he’s asked Drummond to issue an opinion addressing who is responsible under state law for patrolling highways and interstates. He said if that is found to be a responsibility of the Highway Patrol,  he wants Drummond to determine whether the Department of Public Safety can cease enforcement, and if the state Constitution compels Oklahoma’s governor to require the agency to continue its enforcement responsibilities.  
Phil Bacharach, a spokesperson for Drummond, said in a statement that as soon as the attorney general was aware of the reallocation plan, he began to determine its legality. He also confirmed Drummond received Sen. Mann’s request for a legal opinion, but did not have an estimated response time. 
Opinions issued by the Attorney General’s Office are typically legally binding until overturned by a court.

Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is nearing the end of two terms as the state’s chief executive. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A new Rutgers-Eagleton poll says a wide majority of New Jerseyans are not satisfied with the state’s handling of two key economic issues, just four months before voters choose a new governor.
The poll found that 85% of residents are dissatisfied with the state’s approach to affordability and the cost of living, while 80% feel the same about taxes. They are split when asked about the states’ handling of the economy and jobs, with 48% saying they are dissatisfied and 44% saying they are satisfied. Satisfaction on that issue has dropped by 11 points in the last three years.
“New Jerseyans are in a state of malaise when it comes to how Trenton is handling a number of key statewide issues,” Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of Rutgers’ Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling, said in a statement. “There isn’t a single issue where a significant majority is satisfied, even those that have historically proven to be feathers in the state government’s cap.”
New Jerseyans’ views on other issues improve somewhat, but remain mixed. Fifty-seven percent are dissatisfied when it comes to the state budget and government spending and 54% are dissatisfied with transportation and infrastructure. As for education and schools, 47% are satisfied, a double-digit decline on this issue since 2022.
Nearly half of New Jerseyans say state is on wrong track, new poll says

Voters are also split on Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is nearing the end of two terms as the state’s chief executive. The poll gives him a 43% favorability rating (40% unfavorable) and a 47% job approval rating (38% disapproval). Both his favorability and job approval ratings have trended downward since the fall.
“New Jersey’s discontent sets the stage for an interesting governor’s race ahead, where frustration with both state and national politics will compete for the spotlight — and ultimately, for votes,” Koning said.
Murphy is barred from seeking a third term in November. Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11) are vying to succeed him.
Though dissatisfaction was high across the board, Republicans and independent voters were found to be more negative than Democrats.
“Independents are dissatisfied with politics at both the state and national level, so candidate messaging and focus will prove crucial here to courting this ever-important voting bloc,” Koning said.
President Donald Trump is expected to be a key issue in November’s gubernatorial race, with Sherrill hammering Ciattarelli for his support of the president and Ciattarelli knocking Sherrill for her focus on Trump.
The new Rutgers-Eagleton poll found low approval ratings for Trump in New Jersey — just 30% of respondents have a favorable view of him, versus 59% with an unfavorable view. Ten percent have no opinion. Trump’s job approval numbers mirror his favorability ratings.
“Both Murphy and Trump will loom large over this year’s governor’s race, and early indicators of who might play a bigger role or have a more positive or negative influence are a mixed bag right now,” Koning said.
Results are from a statewide poll of 621 adults surveyed between June 13 and June 16.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
After fatal weather-related disasters battered three states over the past week, President Donald Trump’s choice to lead the country’s top weather research agency told lawmakers Wednesday that he supports the administration’s calls to slash its budget—and he failed to directly acknowledge the impact of climate change on extreme weather.
The Trump administration tapped Neil Jacobs, a meteorologist from North Carolina, five months ago to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Jacobs held the job in an acting capacity during the first Trump administration.
On Wednesday, during a nomination hearing held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, Jacobs faced questions about whether and how he would improve forecasting and climate research as the administration calls for cutting NOAA’s budget by nearly 30 percent.
“Neil is a hugely competent meteorologist with a lot of experience in numeric weather forecasting,” Rick Spinrad, the former head of NOAA during the Biden administration, told Inside Climate News. “I worry about his understanding of the full spectrum of NOAA responsibilities.”
In his opening remarks, Jacobs did not mention climate change once, nor did he mention its impact on weather patterns. When asked about climate change by Democratic committee members, he acknowledged human influence but also mentioned natural variability as a factor—a standard offramp for climate deniers.
“He should understand the relationship between climate and weather, but I didn’t hear anything in the hearing suggesting he would invest in that area,” Spinrad said. “We know that there’s a lot more energy in the system, more moisture. So how are we going to position ourselves to take advantage of that knowledge and protect people from severe storms in the future?”
Since Trump took office in January, the agency has lost roughly 2,000 employees to resignations, early retirements and layoffs. The National Weather Service, which operates under NOAA, has lost 600 employees.
The proposed budget cuts and workforce reductions have come under scrutiny in recent days after catastrophic flooding in Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico. The flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas’ Hill Country claimed the lives of more than 115 people, including at least 27 at a 100-year-old girls summer camp, Camp Mystic. At least 173 more people were still missing on Wednesday. Flooding in North Carolina on Sunday killed at least six people. On Tuesday, flash floods killed at least three people in Ruidoso, New Mexico.
Carlos Martinez, a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the National Weather Service did a “fine job” of issuing warnings before the Texas flood, but noted that several key jobs are currently vacant.
“There are lots of questions there,” Martinez said. “Had there been those key positions—even though they did a fine job—would that have helped? I believe the National Weather Service is under stress.”

The committee chairperson, Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who has actively stoked climate change denial while serving in Congress, told the committee in his opening remarks that he visited Camp Mystic on Monday.
“The devastation was the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen,” Cruz said. “The Guadalupe River is normally a quiet and peaceful river. I’ve been swimming and floating in that river dozens of times.”
He then asked Jacobs what he would “do to better ensure that Americans are aware of and able to respond to emergency weather warnings, especially those that arrive in the middle of the night,” as the Guadalupe River flooding did.
Jacobs replied that the Weather Service “did a great job, but there’s a lot of things I would love to improve. Obviously, weather forecasting being one of them.” Over the course of the hearing, he said he intended to modernize NOAA’s radio system and use satellite systems to send out warning messages.
Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) said NOAA is a “hugely important institution,” especially given the increasing number of costly weather disasters that hit the country every year. “Natural disasters cost us over $182 billion in damages last year alone,” Hickenlooper said. “So just a thumbs up or thumbs down. … Do you think we’re spending too much money on the science, the research, around NOAA, or are we spending too little?”
Jacobs replied: “I don’t know that you can spend too much on the research.”
Yet when asked by committee members if he supported the Trump budget proposal, Jacbos said he did. The proposal undercuts essential climate and weather research across a range of programs by about $2.2 billion in the 2026 fiscal year.
The proposed cuts would eliminate NOAA’s regional climate data centers, a network of state labs and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), which oversees research at the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, among other labs, and informs much of the agency’s weather-related functions.
The National Weather Service would see an increase under the Trump proposal, but only because it would absorb research programs being cut and transferred from OAR.
“Dr. Jacobs’ testimony revealed a fundamental disconnect between his stated support for NOAA’s mission in weather, water, and climate, and his endorsement of a budget that would dismantle the very scientific infrastructure necessary to carry it out,” Martinez wrote in an email.
Despite Jacobs’ role in a 2019 controversy colloquially known as “Sharpiegate,” he was only quizzed about it once on Wednesday, by Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.).
In 2019, Trump claimed that Hurricane Dorian was on a path to hit Alabama. When meteorologists at a state weather bureau refuted the information, NOAA released a statement supporting the president’s claim. The president then displayed a NOAA map at a briefing that appeared to have been altered with a black marker to show the hurricane hitting Alabama.
An investigation later found that Jacobs, who was then the acting NOAA administrator, violated the agency’s scientific integrity policy by supporting the statement.
“I just had people—constituents—die in New Mexico. We had constituents die in Texas,” Luján said Wednesday. “Would you sign off on an inaccurate statement due to political pressure in the same event, yes or no?”
“No,” Jacobs replied.
Others are not entirely convinced.
“I do have concerns as a result of the Sharpiegate scandal,” Martinez said. “This hurricane season, future hurricane seasons—will he communicate the science and what his scientists and forecasters are presenting, or will he cave to political pressure as he did, unfortunately, during the first Trump administration?”
The Senate Appropriations Committee is scheduled to vote tomorrow on whether it will include the administration’s cuts in its funding bill.
The committee will vote on Jacob’s confirmation as early as Monday.

The operator of the New England power grid released a study saying a 10-year downturn in consumption of electricity from the region’s generating plants is coming to an end and giving way to the need for more electricity production over the next decade. 
The post Grid operator forecasting 11% increase in electricity consumption by 2034  appeared first on Com[...]","A LONG-EXPECTED SHIFT in New England electricity consumption – from using less power each year to consuming more as residents embrace electric vehicles and heat pumps – is beginning to happen, but the shift isn’t expected to be quite as dramatic as forecasters were predicting just a year ago. 
The operator of the New England power grid released a study on Thursday saying a 10-year downturn in consumption of electricity from the region’s generating plants is coming to an end and giving way to the need for more electricity production over the next decade.  
A year ago, ISO New England forecast a 17 percent increase in consumption of electricity generated by the region’s power plants by 2033. The latest report, citing a slowdown in electric vehicle and electric heat pump adoption rates, pares back the increase to 11 percent by 2034. 
The shift is still fairly dramatic. According to the grid operator, electricity consumption steadily increased between 1995 and 2005, as the region experienced economic growth and New Englanders installed air conditioning in their homes and businesses. That trend reversed after 2005 as many residents reduced their consumption of electricity from power plants by embracing energy efficiency measures and by meeting all or some of their own power needs by installing solar panels. 
Energy efficiency and home-grown solar production are continuing. Overall, solar power production in New England is forecasted to grow 88 percent over the next decade to 14,343 megawatts. Massachusetts is the leader, expected to generate 6,952 megawatts by 2034.  
Still, ISO New England predicts the growth in solar and energy savings from efficiency measures will not be enough to offset the forecasted increased demand for electricity to power vehicles and home heating systems. The regional grid operator is forecasting that the electrification of the transportation and heating sectors will boost summer peak demand by 68 megawatts in 2025 and 956 megawatts by 2034. Peak demand during the winter heating season is expected to rise by 300 megawatts in 2025 and 6,529 megawatts by 2034. 
Those increases are being predicted even though the Trump administration in Washington is pulling back support for electric vehicle, heat pump, and solar power subsidies. 
The New England grid operator is forecasting that “net” electricity use – which is defined as electricity imported into the region or generated locally but not including solar home installations – will hit 130,665 gigawatt hours by 2034. That’s up from 116,813 gigawatt hours in 2024 and below the 2005 peak of 136,425 gigawatt hours. 
ISO New England is not currently sounding alarms about its ability to secure enough electricity to meet future demand growth. A spokeswoman for the grid operator said it is currently counting on the construction of two offshore wind farms – Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts and Revolution Wind off the coast of Rhode Island. Both wind farms are currently under construction and haven’t been blocked by the Trump administration, which opposes the development of offshore wind.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Researchers at the University of South Florida estimate there were 200,000 victims of sex trafficking in the state in 2024. 
A research lab at the university developed what it called a “first-of-its-kind” report, commissioned by the state, looking at the prevalence of trafficking in the Sunshine State. 
In addition, the report estimates there were 540,000 victims of labor exploitation or trafficking last year. 
Of those sex trafficked, USF estimates, half were minors. 
“We believe this annual report will make a substantial impact on anti-trafficking efforts, resulting in many adults and children being spared from the devastating consequences of human trafficking and many survivors receiving safe and effective assistance,” said Sen. Darryl Rouson, the appropriations sponsor of the lab, in a news release. 
The report is a result of SB 7064, a 2023 law that made USF’s Trafficking In Persons lab the state repository for data compiled by state agencies such as the Department of Children and Families and Department of Juvenile Justice, plus nonprofit organizations. The law is set to expire in 2026, although lawmakers may vote to extend the program. 
The 140+ page report details demographics of victims, the legal system as it relates to the crimes, community resources, and state agency support.
“A report like this had not been done in the past because it seemed impossible to gather all these strands of data located with so many different organizations,” said Joan Reid, director of the lab and a criminology professor at USF. “We are extremely grateful for both the state mandate to collect all this data and the funding to make it a reality and support the state’s ongoing response to combat trafficking.”
Of the incident reporting data from Florida Department of Law Enforcement, 84% of victims in the last three years were female and 14% were male. Of the offenders, those numbers were flipped nearly identically, 83% male, 16% female.

The report also detailed the results of human trafficking screenings, a 2014 measure that looks to identify and locate youth who may be victims of commercial sexual exploitation. The Department of Juvenile Justice conducted 8,527 human trafficking screenings in 2024. Of those, nearly 8,000 were considered likely not or definitely not a victim. Many of those at least likely to be a victim were identified as running away excessively and potentially trafficked or sexually exploited. 
The report says that Florida is “at the forefront in human trafficking policy, with penalties that far exceed the national average,” referencing that the maximum sentence for convictions of human trafficking crimes is life imprisonment. 
FDLE reported 90 human trafficking arrests in 2024.

Which cities?
Data within the report show that 340,389 commercial sex ads were posted in the state during a 90-day window last year. The cities with the most sex ads per resident were Cocoa Beach, Pensacola, Destin, St. Augustine, Fort Walton Beach, Panama City, and Naples. 
Jacksonville had the most total commercial sex ads with well more than double the next closest city, Orlando, followed by Tampa, Pensacola, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Myers. 
Human trafficking, the report states, “operates on basic market principles: where this is demand, traffickers supply,” and that ads reflect demand.

The report compiled the number of illicit massage businesses in the state, facade businesses that are considered to lure victims into sex and labor trafficking. The cities with the most illicit massage businesses per resident were Naples, Orange Park, Port Richey, and North Palm Beach. The cities with the highest number of illicit massage businesses were Orlando, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Pompano Beach, and West Palm Beach. 
Between 2019-2024, Broward County had the highest number of illicit massage businesses each year, according to the report, followed by Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties.
The report said Florida is “especially susceptible to human trafficking” “[d]ue to its high population, the number of major cities that host national and international events, prevalence of airports and ports, and major industries such as agriculture, tourism and entertainment.”

President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly six million jobs nationally, including 150,000 in Pennsylvania, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states. According to the analysis, Pennsylvania would see 65,00 immigrant job losses and 50,000 U.S.-born job losses.

The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. That includes 20,000 construction jobs lost in Pennsylvania, including 8,000 U.S.-born workers.
The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.

Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

July 10, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMembers of the Michigan Board of State Canvassers on Thursday walked back their approval for a proposal to raise taxes on the wealthy to better fund the state’s public schools following a controversy surrounding changes to the petition language. 
Daniel Ziegler, an attorney representing the opposing Coalition to Stop the Business and Family Tax Hike, opened the board meeting with a request, asking members to rescind their approval of the summary language for the Invest in MI Kids petition, saying the proposal’s committee altered the petition language hours before the public comment period closed.
As a result, Ziegler argued the group evaded public comment on the updated petition, leading to the board considering and approving a 100-word summary at their June 27 meeting based on the wrong version of the petition, which was not subject to public comment. Additionally, there was no public comment during the meeting, Ziegler noted, arguing it failed to receive input on both the front and back end.

After going into closed session for a little over half an hour, acting Director of Elections Adam Fracassi laid out the timeline on the group’s petition submissions, telling the board the initial request for a constitutional amendment was received and put out for public comment on June 10. However, the group submitted revised language for the petition on June 16, with public comment set to close on June 17. 
Both the June 16, and a later June 20 submission had been altered to exclude the word public from the phrase “local public school districts,” with the group’s attorney Olivia Flower noting that Michigan law uses the term “local school district.” 
Fracassi said that the final version of the petition was not available online until June 24.
The board unanimously voted to rescind its approval of the petition’s 100-word summary and reset the summary approval process. 
Flower argued it was improper for the board to rescind their approval, as they had not violated the Michigan Open Meetings Act. 

“The Open Meetings Act allows for the opportunity for the public to review the deliberations for the form on the record. Those deliberations were fulsome and spirited, and everyone commented on the actual form of the petition that was before the board, then is still before the board now,” Flower said.

Although the board was initially scheduled to consider the form of the proposed constitutional amendment, the matter was removed from the agenda in light of the board’s vote. 
Thursday’s meeting also marked the consideration of two ballot initiatives aimed at requiring voters to verify their citizenship in order to cast their ballot, with both proposals submitted by the same organization, Americans for Citizen Voting. 
While the board approved the summary language for the group’s initial petition at their meeting in May, the form was not, due to a few typos in the proposed language for the constitutional amendment.
Alongside considering the form for the first effort, the board considered the language and form for the group’s second proposed amendment.
Canvasser Heather Cummings, a Democrat, raised questions on why the ballot committee would file a second initiative with the same goals as the first, after the group’s attorney, David Porter, explained they would not be withdrawing the first effort. 
“We took a lot of the comments that were made at the last meeting and discussion by the board to heart. Some of those changes are reflected in this new proposal. So it just offers a different alternative, in case we would like to proceed with that,” Porter said. 
Paul Jacob, the group’s chair, explained that the group had not yet decided which proposal it planned to circulate among voters for placement on the ballot. 
“We’re unlikely to do two. We’re very likely to do one,” Jacob said, noting that they would likely proceed with the second proposal.
By law, the group can propose and file as many measures as it would like, Jacob said, assuring Cummings “two is as many as we would like.”
However, Mark Brewer, a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party and the attorney for Promote the Vote Action, which opposes the proposal and the other effort requiring voters to verify their citizenship, called the move bad form. 
“I’ve been practicing before this board since the 1980s… I have never seen anybody and I would not advise my clients to do what is being done here today. I just think it’s poor practice and doesn’t serve democracy to hide the ball in terms of what proposal a group’s going to circulate,” Brewer said.
While the board approved the form of the first petition and the summary language and form for the second petition, Board Chair Richard Houskamp, a Republican, chastised the group for submitting multiple petitions seeking the same end, telling members of the ballot committee they were setting a dangerous precedent.

When asked whether they would consider withdrawing one of their proposals, Jacob declined, though Americans for Citizen Voting – Michigan Treasurer Kurt O’Keefe told Houskamp “it’s highly likely that your concern will be met in a way that you find appropriate.”
Following the meeting, Jacob spoke with reporters, explaining that the group’s second proposal was filed out of concern that the first proposal “could get blocked at any point,” and that they did not want to place their  trust in the first proposal receiving approval. 
“Today, people working on this campaign are going to get together and decide which measure should we go with. I think it’s pretty likely it’ll be this second one that was just approved,” he said.
The two proposals mark the second and third effort approved by the board in recent months aimed at preventing noncitizens from voting in Michigan elections. The first, approved in April, was launched in support of an effort introduced by House Majority Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) in the Legislature, which would require Michigan residents to show proof of citizenship when casting their ballot and registering to vote.
Jacob said his group had been in contact with the organization in charge of the other initiative, the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, and while their proposals are close, he considers their most recent proposal to be the best effort. 
Unlike the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights proposal, Jacob said their proposal offers more clarity on what it would require from the Secretary of State, as well as the rules and penalties for violating the law. It also does not require any action from the Legislature, Jacob said, whereas the other group’s proposal would have the Legislature craft a program to ensure citizens facing hardship have the documents needed to cast their ballot. 
In order to make the ballot in 2026, the groups will need to gather nearly 446,198 signatures within 180 days and file them with the Secretary of State, with Jacob telling reporters they expect to launch their effort before the end of the month. 
 He also doesn’t expect to see two competing petition drives. 
“There’s no fight here. There’s people who want to see only citizens voting, making sure that our elections are secure, and we’re going to all be working together,” he said.

While noncitizens are barred from voting in federal elections, conservatives in Michigan have raised alarms over election security after a Chinese citizen attending the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor cast a ballot in the 2024 general election. However, a review from the Michigan Department of State released in April confirmed instances of noncitizen voting are extremely rare, with only 15 credible cases identified out of the more than 5.7 millions ballots cast in the state in the general election last year.
Micheal Davis, the executive director of Promote the Vote, called Americans for Citizen Voting’s efforts “yet another initiative that aims to make it more difficult for all eligible voters to cast a ballot,” but applauded the board of canvassers changes to the petition summary, highlighting negative impacts the proposal would have on voters. 
“Michigan’s elections are secure and accurate, and we should be looking for ways to build on that progress, not trying to bury citizens in unnecessary red tape. We urge Michiganders to visit noredtapeformi.com and decline to sign the petitions for these harmful initiatives,” Davis said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3969-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)When North Dakota state Sen. Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
Rent is eating up a greater share of tenants’ income in almost every state

“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”










If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate. That’s almost a given here.


– North Dakota Democratic state Sen. Ryan Braunberger


The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
 Compromises

Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
 Elsewhere

Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.
South Carolina’s bipartisan bill was introduced in late March and received no action before the session ended in May, other than legislators adding their names as a co-sponsor. It could be taken up next year, however. The chief sponsor is a Republican from fast-growing Horry County. There are 10 co-sponsors: five Republicans and five Democrats.










I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible.


– North Dakota Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta


This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)Four more former Southern Regional Jail correctional officers were sentenced to prison this week for their roles in the death of an inmate in 2022. 
Quantez Burks, identified in Justice Department news releases by his initials, died March 1, 2022, reportedly one day after being booked in the Raleigh County, West Virginia jail on charges of wanton endangerment and obstructing an officer. Officers in the case have been convicted of taking Burks to an area of the prison without cameras and assaulting him in retaliation for attempting to leave his assigned pod.
Mark Holdren, 41, of Beckley, was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years in prison and Johnathan Walters, 33, of Rainelle, got 21 years — each for conspiring with other officers to violate the man’s civil rights, resulting in his death. They were sentenced to three years of supervised release after prison. 
In addition, a judge on Thursday sentenced Corey Snyder, 30, to 19 years and seven months for conspiring with other officers to violate Burks’ civil rights by using unreasonable force. 
Jacob Boothe, 27, got three years in prison for failing to intervene to stop fellow officers from assaulting Burks.
According to the Department of Justice, Snyder, Holdren and other officers brought Burks to an interview room where Walters joined them. There, they struck and kicked him, pulled and twisted his fingers and used pepper spray while the man was restrained and handcuffed. Boothe was present during the assault and did not try to stop it, the Justice department said. 
Walters and other officers also carried Burks by his arms and legs and then swung his head into a metal door to open it, the release says, and then dropped him onto a concrete floor. Emergency personnel declared him dead not long after. 
Altogether, six former officers have been indicted in the assault. Former officer Ashley Toney pleaded guilty last year to failing to intervene to protect Burks from the officers’ assault and was sentenced to six years and six months in prison. A jury found Chad Lester, a former lieutenant, guilty on three obstruction of justice charges for his role in conspiring to cover up the death. He was sentenced to 17 years and six months in prison on May 15, 2025.
Two other former officers — Steven Nicholas Wimmer and Andrew Fleshman — pleaded guilty before the indictment to conspiring to use unreasonable force against Burks. Wimmer, 26, of Bluefield, was sentenced to nine years in prison. Fleshman is set to be sentenced Monday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-10 20:30:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Hospitals see risks in big federal tax law that shrinks Medicaid spending,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/10/big-tax-law-shrinks-medicaid-spending/,The Mississippi Hospital Association says a big new federal law could cause deeper financial problems for some hospitals in one of the poorest states in the nation.,"Mississippi hospitals could lose up to $1 billion over the next decade under the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax and policy bill President Donald Trump signed into law last week, according to leaders at the Mississippi Hospital Association.
The leaders say the cuts could force some already-struggling rural hospitals to reduce services or close their doors.
The law includes the largest reduction in federal health and social safety net programs in history. It passed 218-214, with all Democrats voting against the measure and all but five Republicans voting for it. 
In the short term, these cuts will make health care less accessible to poor Mississippians by making the eligibility requirements for Medicaid insurance stiffer, likely increasing people’s medical debt. 
In the long run, the cuts could lead to worsening chronic health conditions such as diabetes and obesity for which Mississippi already leads the nation, and making private insurance more expensive for many people, experts say. 
“We’ve got about a billion dollars that are potentially hanging in the balance over the next 10 years,” Mississippi Hospital Association President Richard Roberson said Wednesday during a panel discussion at his organization’s headquarters.

“If folks were being honest, the entire system depends on those rural hospitals,” he said.
Mississippi’s uninsured population could increase by 160,000 people as a combined result of the new law and the expiration of Biden-era enhanced subsidies that made marketplace insurance affordable – and which Trump is not expected to renew – according to KFF, a health policy research group. 
That could make things even worse for those who are left on the marketplace plans. 
“Younger, healthier people are going to leave the risk pool, and that’s going to mean it’s more expensive to insure the patients that remain,” said Lucy Dagneau, senior director of state and local campaigns at the American Cancer Society. 
Among the biggest changes facing Medicaid-eligible patients are stiffer eligibility requirements, including proof of work. The new law requires able-bodied adults ages 19 to 64 to work, do community service or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to qualify for, or keep, Medicaid coverage and federal food aid. 
Opponents say qualified recipients could be stripped of benefits if they lose a job or fail to complete paperwork attesting to their time commitment.
Georgia became the case study for work requirements with a program called Pathways to Coverage, which was touted as a conservative alternative to Medicaid expansion. 
Ironically, the 54-year-old mechanic chosen by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to be the face of the program got so fed up with the work requirements he went from praising the program on television to saying “I’m done with it” after his benefits were allegedly cancelled twice due to red tape. 
Roberson sent several letters to Mississippi’s congressional members in weeks leading up to the final vote on the sweeping federal legislation, sounding the alarm on what it would mean for hospitals and patients.
Among Roberson’s chief concerns is a change in the mechanism called state directed payments, which allows states to beef up Medicaid reimbursement rates – typically the lowest among insurance payors. The new law will reduce those enhanced rates to nearly as low as the Medicare rate, costing the state at least $500 million and putting rural hospitals in a bind, Roberson told Mississippi Today. 
That change will happen over 10 years starting in 2028. That, in conjunction with the new law’s  one-time payment program called the Rural Health Care Fund, means if the next few years look normal, it doesn’t mean Mississippi is safe, stakeholders warn. 
“We’re going to have a sort of deceiving situation in Mississippi where we look a little flush with cash with the rural fund and the state directed payments in 2027 and 2028, and then all of a sudden our state directed payments start going down and that fund ends and then we’re going to start dipping,” said Leah Rupp Smith, vice president for policy and advocacy at the Mississippi Hospital Association.

Even with that buffer time, immediate changes are on the horizon for health care in Mississippi because of fear and uncertainty around ever-changing rules. 
“Hospitals can’t budget when we have these one-off programs that start and stop and the rules change – and there’s a cost to administering a program like this,” Smith said.
Since hospitals are major employers – and they also provide a sense of safety for incoming businesses –  their closure, especially in rural areas, affects not just patients but local economies and communities. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is the only Democrat in Mississippi’s congressional delegation. He voted against the bill, while the state’s two Republican senators and three Republican House members voted for it. Thompson said in a statement that the new law does not bode well for the Delta, one of the poorest regions in the U.S. 
“For my district, this means closed hospitals, nursing homes, families struggling to afford groceries, and educational opportunities deferred,” Thompson said. “Republicans’ priorities are very simple: tax cuts for (the) wealthy and nothing for the people who make this country work.”
While still colloquially referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the name was changed by Democrats invoking a maneuver that has been used by lawmakers in both chambers to oppose a bill on principle. 
“Democrats are forcing Republicans to delete their farcical bill name,” Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement. “Nothing about this bill is beautiful — it’s a betrayal to American families and it’s undeserving of such a stupid name.”
The law is expected to add at least $3.3 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next 10 years, according to the most recent estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09170138/Big-Beautiful-Bill-Effect-on-Ms-Health-Care-8.jpg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

Slow-moving showers and scattered thunderstorms that began Thursday morning are expected to continue throughout the afternoon and evening, which could lead to flooding in low lying areas in the state. 
Some parts of the state may see no precipitation while other areas may see 1 to 3 inches of rain or more, said Matthew Clay, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Burlington office.
The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm and flooding warnings for Vermont, and meteorologists expect up to 60 miles per hour wind and quarter-sized hail, particularly in the northwestern portion of the state and Lamoille County. 
Clay said the weather conditions could bring localized lightning, torrential rain, and “some gusty to damaging winds.”
“All the thunderstorms today are going to be capable of producing very heavy rain and frequent cloud-to-ground lightning,” Clay said. 
The storm is forecast to move eastward across the state Thursday afternoon and evening, with the most severe conditions expected to hit between 3 and 8 p.m., he said. 
While watching for flash flooding, Clay said the weather service has only observed standing water flood conditions in areas in the state, which are flood conditions that are slower developing and less life-threatening. 
National Weather Service Meteorologist Seth Kutikoff said the weather event predicted is not a cause for high alarm as it is a “typical type of thunderstorm that we get at least a few times a year.” Hot conditions are expected to follow in the coming week, he said.
He also recommended that people in Vermont remain near shelter areas throughout Thursday and stay aware of rain and wind conditions.
“I just recommend people to stay calm,” Kutikoff said. “We’re not expecting any high end impacts.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal district court judge in New Hampshire said Thursday he will issue an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and will hold that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.
Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t now have injunctions, but it will be stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.
Issued in January, the executive order, titled, “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid.
On Thursday, Laplante agreed.
“The deprivation of U.S. citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the forthcoming ruling in a press conference after the hearing.
“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”
Laplante’s ruling came weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class actions — national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held.
New precedent
Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action designation to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action within days of the Casa decision in June.
The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities.
Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants.
Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.
Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.
“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said.
The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there.
Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump. In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order.
In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

Up in northwest Montana, Glacier National Park notched record visitation for May, the most recent month data is available, with 238,766 recreation visitors passing through the entrance stations. 
Bolstered by more than 30,000 additional visitors in May compared to the next highest year, Glacier has welcomed 346,437 visitors so far this year — 12% more than the same period last year and a whopping 31% more than in 2017, the park’s record year. 
During its banner year in 2017, Glacier saw more than 1 million visitors in July and more than 900,000 in August. Last year, the park set records for late-season visitation in September and October due to changes to the pilot vehicle reservation system Glacier officials instigated in 2021 to moderate the impacts of increased tourists. 
New changes to the park’s reservation system for this year include timed enty’s on the park’s western entrances. 
The record tourist visits to Montana’s national parks come as the National Park Service is at historically low levels of staffing. 
A recent report by the National Parks Conservation Association indicates the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent workforce since January, with 4,000 staff members leaving the agency through “terminations, pressured buyouts, deferred resignations and early retirement buyouts.”
“This has left parks severely understaffed during peak visitation, putting visitor centers, trail maintenance and public safety at risk when help is needed most,” the report states.
In response to questions earlier this year from the Daily Montanan about staffing levels at Glacier and Yellowstone, the National Park Service Office of Public Affairs issued a generic statement. 
“The National Park Service is hiring seasonal workers to continue enhancing the visitor experience as we embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation in workforce management. We are focused on ensuring that every visitor has the chance to explore and connect with the incredible, iconic spaces of our national parks,” the statement said. “NPS is working closely with the Office of Personnel Management to ensure we are prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people. As always, NPS will continue to provide critical services and deliver excellent customer service.”
An internal memo from Glacier obtained by the Daily Montanan showed that in early May, more than 20% of park positions were vacant, including almost half of dispatch positions. 
“Dispatch is down to 60% staffing, so expect 60% service,” the memo stated. 
The Daily Montanan has confirmed a number of Glacier Park employees who have left their positions since May, including former public information officer Gina Icenoggle, who told reporters in May that her position would likely not be filled, and instead be folded into the Department of the Interior, leaving no local public information personnel in place.  
 Trump issues EO on foreign visitor surcharge

On July 3, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Interior to increase entry fees at national park service sites for foreign tourists, “improving affordability for United States residents, and expanding opportunities to enjoy America’s splendid national treasures.”
The idea, long championed by Bozeman-based “free-market environmentalism” nonprofit think tank Property and Environment Research Center could rake in tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue for national parks facing maintenance backlogs and budget cuts.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/27812931390_9e7f9f596a_k-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 17:14:13.573716

Laura Kelly sent GOP governor candidate Jeff Colyer a letter Thursday denouncing Colyer's use of a devastating May tornado to seek donations for his campaign. This July 9 image is of damage to Grinnell, which was pummeled by a tornado. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly objected to Republican governor candidate Jeff Colyer’s fundraising appeals tied to a devastating tornado that tore through Pratt, Stafford and Reno counties in May.
In a letter obtained by Kansas Reflector, Kelly criticized Colyer for issuing two fundraising messages in June that alleged Kelly’s response to the storm fell short of expectations after an EF3 tornado barreled into the communities of Grinnell and Plevna. Damage to buildings and equipment was substantial, but no one was killed.
“You should know better than to use an emergency disaster response for patently political purposes,” Kelly said in the letter to Colyer. “Beyond tacky and crass.”
She said it was wrong to manipulate damaged Kansas communities for campaign photo opportunities or to package such heartbreaking events to attack a political rival.
“Just to set the record straight, Jeff, my emergency management team was in communication and on the ground with local responders immediately,” Kelly’s letter said. “And, as soon as my presence would be helpful, and not get in the way of recovery efforts, I was there.”
Colyer’s requests for campaign donations of $25, $50 or $100 were laced with claims Kelly was slow to seek disaster assistance. He said he was building a “movement to put Kansas first, to ensure no community is left behind and to deliver the kind of leadership that doesn’t flinch in a crisis.”
Colyer, who served nearly a year as governor following the resignation of Gov. Sam Brownback, said he would have immediately deployed the Kansas National Guard and promptly ordered removal of storm debris after the May 18-19 storm.
He said he would have requested the presidential disaster declaration before Kelly did on June 17.
“This is a moment for leadership and compassion,” Colyer’s campaign messages said. “Our neighbors are hurting. I’ve walked their shattered fields and seen the wreckage of a lifetime.”
Colyer asserted — falsely, the governor’s office said — that neither Kelly nor administration officials visited the damage zone before June 3. Colyer published images of him touring storm damage with a half-dozen state legislators.
In a news release published June 18, Kelly said the Kansas Division of Emergency Management began coordination of the storm response with local officials on May 18.
The Kansas Department of Transportation mobilized the night of the tornado to close Interstate 70 and clear debris and downed powerlines, the governor said. KDOT organized traffic control for interstate lane reductions until new power poles were installed by May 21.
Officials with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment issued a disposal-without-a-permit to Grinnell on May 20 for on-site burial of disaster debris. KDHE issued a fee waiver to Plevna for the Reno County landfill.
On May 21, KDHE suspended fees for obtaining certified copies of birth and marriage certificates for Gove County residents through July 18.
The governor said she visited Grinnell on May 22, secured U.S. Small Business Administration low-interest loans for nine counties on May 31, issued a state disaster emergency proclamation for 11 counties on June 4, initiated the process of documenting damage for the Federal Emergency Management Agency on June 5 and submitted the major presidential disaster declaration on June 17.
“You owe the people of Grinnell and Plevna an apology,” Kelly’s letter to Colyer said. “Next time, before you make a fool of yourself, call me. I’ll be glad to give you the facts.”

A midsummer federal education funding freeze has iced more than $33 million earmarked for Idaho — creating a climate of uncertainty.
The Boise School District is hoping to avoid staff cuts. A Democratic legislator — and Boise school teacher — is particularly worried about a program for students who are trying to learn English. State superintendent Debbie Critchfield has freed up $2.8 million to fill part of the gap.
But Critchfield, a Republican, is largely staying out of the fray. She declined an interview request, and in a statement, she said she is hoping the funding will ultimately find its way to the states. “We’re hopeful we will know the timeline for distribution sooner rather than later as decisions are being made now in local districts for the coming school year.”
Technically speaking, the White House hasn’t cut the funding, which Congress has already authorized. Instead, the U.S. Department of Education withheld the July 1 payments, while it reviews a host of federal grant programs.
In a terse June 30 email to Critchfield’s office, shared with Idaho EdNews, the federal Education Department said it “remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
This puts $33.3 million of Idaho’s federal funding on hold, Critchfield’s office says. Here’s how that breaks down:
“Supporting effective instruction:” $10.8 million. A federal grant program — known officially as Title II-A — provides states and local schools funding for professional development.
Migrant education: $7.1 million. The feds’ Title I-C program is designed to provide extra help for students who frequently move from school to school.
Student support and academic enrichment: $6.7 million. Known as Title IV-A, these grants can be used for anything from digital literacy and new course offerings to bullying prevention and suicide prevention.
Before- and after-school programs: $6.5 million. The Title IV-B grants finance “21st Century Community Learning Centers” that operate outside the normal school day.
English language programs: $2.1 million. The feds’ Title III grants “provide equal learning opportunities for multilingual learners,” according to an Idaho Department of Education web page on the program.
All told, a $33 million freeze could affect 16.5% of Idaho’s federal education funding, according to the Learning Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. Only four states and the District of Columbia face deeper funding cuts.
Critchfield threw a lifeline to some local schools, as James Dawson of Boise State Public Radio first reported Wednesday. The state Education Department said it would free up $2.8 million, holdover money from previous budget years, to fund after-school programs through at least December.
“Our goal is to reduce uncertainty and help programs retain experienced staff who are essential to continued operations,” Sheena Strickler, the department’s 21st Century Community Learning Centers coordinator, said in a Wednesday email to grant recipients.
For some districts, the freeze still could have a profound impact on the bottom line. In Nampa, for example, $1.7 million is on the line. “(We’re) staying in close contact with the State Department of Education and remain hopeful for more clarity and a timely resolution,” district spokesman Matt Sizemore told Dawson.
Boise school Superintendent Lisa Roberts
In Boise, $1.5 million is in jeopardy.
“Without this funding, we would face difficult decisions that could affect student supports and services,” Superintendent Lisa Roberts said Wednesday, in an email to staff and parents. “We are committed to working thoughtfully to avoid staffing reductions and minimize any disruption to our students and schools.”
But schools have little time and few options, said Rep. Soñia Galaviz, a Boise Democrat who sits on the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee. In Boise, Galaviz and her fellow teachers will be returning to work in early August. Unless schools dip into their budget reserves to make up for lost federal dollars — a risky move in and of itself — they might not have any other way to keep staff on the payroll.
“There’s no safety net,” she said Wednesday. “There’s no secret bank account.”
Galaviz teaches at Boise’s Whittier Elementary School, where nearly 24% of students have limited English proficiency. She is particularly concerned about a potential cut in English language programs — especially after President Donald Trump has issued an executive order declaring English the nation’s official language, and after the 2025 Legislature approved a constitutional amendment, subject to voter approval, to make English the state’s official language. Cutting off support for students trying to learn English would be “an enormous loss,” Galaviz said.
Rep. Wendy Horman, JFAC’s House co-chair, said she wanted more details about how schools spend the federal dollars. Until then, she’s reluctant to say whether any of these programs are critical to K-12.
“I can see big buckets of money,” said Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican. “But what I can’t see and don’t know is how those monies are used at the local level.”
Horman also noted that federal funding is a moving target. She pointed to a $59 million University of Idaho ag research grant. In April, the feds yanked the grant, the largest in U of I history. But the U of I was allowed to reapply for the money, and did so last month.
“I think we have more questions than answers at this time,” Horman said.
Critchfield has directed many of her questions at Idaho’s congressional delegation — asking if they have any information about when the feds might free up money.
Meanwhile, she says, local schools might be forced to pick up the slack.
“We’ve encouraged local districts and charters to review any carryover funding that may help support the programs in question,” she said in a statement.

Still pending approval, according to the governor’s office:
• direct financial assistance for individuals, households, and businesses in the affected areas of Lincoln and Valencia counties, including grants for:
• repair or replacement of homes destroyed in the disaster
• necessary expenses and essential needs including medical, dental, funeral, personal property, and transportation costs
• one-time payment for emergency supplies including water, food, first aid, breastfeeding supplies, infant formula, diapers, personal hygiene items, and fuel for transportation
• temporary housing including hotels, staying with family or friends, or other suitable options for displaced residents
• transitional sheltering assistance
• federal reimbursement for emergency work, including debris removal for Chaves, Lincoln, Otero, and Valencia counties
• permanent repair of disaster-damaged facilities and public infrastructure for Chaves, Lincoln, Otero and Valencia counties
The governor’s office also noted the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management is actively working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct preliminary damage assessments.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) who also visited Ruidoso for a news conference Thursday morning noted in a news release the state’s entire congressional delegation had urged President Donald Trump to sign the emergency declaration.
“The impacts of this historic flood require federal resources for adequate recovery and ongoing mitigation efforts, there’s no other way around it,” Vasquez said in a statwment. “Working with local, state, and federal officials, we successfully unlocked crucial disaster funding to address the immediate needs of recovery operations.”

Free.,US Senate Dems from Western states blast Trump budget for cutting federal aid,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-western-states-blast-trump-budget-cutting-federal-aid,,"Members of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee differed along party lines at a Thursday hearing about how the U.S. Forest Service should partner with states and how the federal wildfire response should be organized.Senators of both parties emphasized the importance of working  with state forest managers. But while Republicans praised the efforts of Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, a former state forest administrator in Idaho and Montana, to reach out to state governments, Democrats noted that President Donald Trump’s budget request for fiscal 2026 proposed eliminating a key program for state and tribal partnerships.Democrats on the panel also raised a series of questions about the still-unfinished Forest Service budget request as the next fiscal year approaches in less than three months.Schultz told the senators the budget proposal was not yet final, but confirmed the agency was telling states to prepare for zero dollars in discretionary spending for the State, Private, and Tribal Forestry program in fiscal 2026.The program received more than $300 million in discretionary funding in fiscal 2024, plus another roughly $300 million in supplemental funding.The Trump budget request does include $300 million for supplemental funds to the program that can be used for disaster relief.Impact of ‘big, beautiful’ lawRanking Democrat Martin Heinrich of New Mexico noted states are facing tighter budgets after passage of Republicans’ “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation law that includes a host of policy tweaks meant to reduce federal safety net spending while extending tax cuts for high earners.Under the law, states will be required to pay billions more per year to cover a greater share of major federal-state partnership programs for food assistance and health coverage.“States need that funding,” Heinrich said of the forestry program. “That is an example of a successful partnership. If we don’t have that funding, that’s not shared responsibility, that’s abdicating our federal responsibility… at a time when (state) budgets are being decimated by Medicaid cuts thanks to the big, whatever bill.”Schultz said the state foresters had relayed similar concerns, which the administration was considering as it finalized the budget request.Chairman Mike Lee of Utah said the Forest Service under Schultz had given states greater flexibility to set their own forest management policies.“I want to thank you, Chief, for giving the states more and more authority, more involvement and more of an ability to set a course for the proper management of these lands,” he said. “I know that Utah is really looking forward to working with you to expand these partnerships and I know my state is not alone in that.”Funding versus dialogueDemocratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California also blasted the administration for cutting the state forestry spending.“Every state that I’m aware of is having a tougher budget picture to face,” he told Schultz. “The threat of fires is real. The threat of fires is growing. How does it make sense for the federal government to zero out these programs?”Schultz answered that the agency would continue “partnering with the states in dialogue and discussion.”“But you’re zeroing out their resources,” Padilla said.“That’s correct,” Schultz said. “It’s sharing that responsibility and pushing it to the states.”Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper, a former governor and Denver mayor, said the Trump budget request more broadly called for shifting more funding responsibilities to state and local governments.“I see again and again, throughout all the budgets we're seeing, is more costs shifted from the federal government to states and local areas that are going through their own budget struggles right now,” he said.Montana Republican Steve Daines defended the idea of greater state responsibility, saying he had found the Gem State’s approach to land management more effective than the federal government’s.“If you take a look at the landscapes across Montana and look at federal lands versus state lands, I can tell you the state's doing a much, much better job in terms of stewardship of public lands than the federal government,” Daines said.New firefighting serviceSchultz said several times the administration had not yet finalized a plan to shift federal firefighting authorities to the Interior Department. The responsibility is currently split between the Forest Service, which is under the Department of Agriculture, and various Interior agencies, primarily the Bureau of Land Management.Heinrich, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, raised concerns about the lack of a plan.Heinrich said he was open-minded about the reorganization effort but was concerned that Congress had not yet seen a blueprint.“I think there are many of us who are more concerned about the adequacy of that plan and would like to see that plan before we start making budgetary decisions about whether it's a good idea or not,” he said. “I am very open to different ways of organizing how we fight fires on our national forests and our public lands. But I want to see the plan.”Wyden raised opposition to the idea more broadly, saying the Forest Service should remain involved in firefighting.“Nobody in my home state… has told me, in effect, ‘Ron we gotta have the Forest Service less involved in fighting fires,’” Wyden said. “But that is the net effect of your organizational plan.”Schultz said the proposed reorganization would not cut any federal firefighting resources, but move the federal agency responsible for overseeing the issue. The administration would not put the reorganization in place this fire season, he added.",,,,2025-07-10 16:14:38.370192

The Delaware State Police announced the promotion of Captain J. Andrew Lloyd to the rank of Major, which went into effect on June 27, 2025. Major Lloyd now serves as the New Castle County Operations Officer, bringing over two decades of law enforcement experience to his new leadership role.
“This will continue to strengthen the Delaware State Police,” said Colonel William D. Crotty, Superintendent of the Delaware State Police. 
Major Lloyd began his career as a patrol trooper at Troops 6 and 7 and was later promoted to Sergeant at Troop 9. He went on to supervise the Criminal Investigations Unit at Troop 2, overseeing both the Drug Unit and the Property Crimes Unit. His work included a high-profile joint investigation with the New Castle County Police Department, Wilmington Police Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. That investigation led to the disruption of one of Delaware’s largest heroin distribution networks.
He also led investigations into firearms and racketeering crimes, collaborated with federal partners, and was recognized as an expert in Superior Court.
In 2019, Lloyd became a Lieutenant at Troop 9, where he led 35 sworn troopers and civilian staff while working closely with government agencies and civic groups. That same year, he received international recognition with the 2019 IACP 40 Under 40 award, honoring him as one of the world’s top law enforcement leaders under the age of 40.

From 2021 to 2024, Lloyd served as Director of the State Bureau of Identification. During his tenure, he modernized background checks, enhanced fingerprint digitization, negotiated key contracts, and strengthened Delaware’s participation in the National Fingerprint File. He also led the division’s largest civilian workforce and supported public security legislation.
Most recently, Lloyd commanded nearly 100 troopers and civilian staff as the Commander of Troop 3. Under his leadership, the troop expanded its proactive enforcement efforts and enhanced community partnerships to support crime-reduction initiatives. He also managed the Delaware State Police’s operational response to major events, including NASCAR and the Phish Festival, and oversaw the implementation of a high-risk violent offender program.
Lloyd holds both a Master of Science and a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice from Wilmington University, with a graduate specialization in Homeland Security. He is also a graduate of the FBI National Academy Session 289.
Beyond his law enforcement duties, Major Lloyd has volunteered for over a decade as a youth basketball, softball, and Little League coach. He continues to support Special Olympics Delaware and has served on several DSP committees, including as Chair of the Wellness Committee and Co-Chair of the Events Committee for the agency’s 100th Anniversary Planning Committee.
The Delaware State Police congratulated Major Lloyd on the promotion in a statement: “Delaware State Police congratulates Andrew Lloyd for this well-deserved promotion.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Nebraska Examiner)President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

ChristianaCare and Delaware County leaders marked a major milestone in the construction of ChristianaCare Hospital, Aston, on July 9 with a ceremonial beam-signing to commemorate the completion of the structural phase of the project.
Located at 700 N. Turner Way, the 20,000-square-foot hospital remains on track to open in the second half of 2026. ChristianaCare is developing the facility in partnership with Emerus Holdings, Inc., the nation’s leading developer of neighborhood hospitals.
“This is an exciting moment, not just for ChristianaCare, but for the Aston community,” said Pauline Corso, president of Ambulatory Network Continuity and Growth at ChristianaCare. 
“We’re building more than just a hospital. We’re building relationships, trust and access to much-needed care where people live. It’s been incredible to see this hospital take shape, and we can’t wait to welcome our neighbors through the doors.”

“Signing this commemorative beam is a proud and meaningful milestone,” he said. “This hospital will bring vital, high-quality care to the people of Aston Township — close to home and when they need it most,” said Jim Bennett, MHA, BSN, FACHE, market CEO for ChristianaCare-Emerus. “From emergency services to specialty care in a modern, welcoming environment, it’s thoughtfully designed to meet the everyday health needs of this community. We’re excited for what’s ahead and honored to be part of this next chapter in care.”
Unlike standalone emergency departments or urgent care centers, ChristianaCare Hospital, Aston will be a fully licensed, small-format hospital open 24/7. It will include a full-service emergency department capable of treating common emergencies such as falls, injuries, heart attacks and strokes. Additional services will include a 10-bed inpatient unit, diagnostic imaging (CT, X-ray, ultrasound), laboratory services, and access to virtual consultations with specialists in fields such as cardiology and neurology.

The hospital’s second floor will house a health center offering outpatient services, including both primary and specialty care, to ensure comprehensive, patient-centered care in the community.
ChristianaCare Hospital, Aston is part of a broader investment in southeastern Pennsylvania. In addition to Aston, a hospital has been approved for Springfield Township, and ChristianaCare will open its first Pennsylvania hospital in West Grove this summer.

Jim Pillen on Tuesday announced the appointments of all but one member to Nebraska’s new School Financing Review Commission to review and provide annual recommendations to stabilize state aid to schools and reduce reliance on local property taxes.
State lawmakers created the 18-member commission, chaired by Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, in a 48-0 vote this spring. It took effect June 5 and required initial appointments within 30 days. 
The group’s main task is reviewing the main school funding formula — the Tax Equity and Educational Opportunities Support Act (TEEOSA) — and providing periodic suggestions so the Legislature can update it.

There remains one vacancy for a certified public school teacher.
Pillen on Tuesday called the commission “a first but critically important step” in fixing a “35-year problem” since TEEOSA was established in 1990. The formula survived a veto and public referendum after its creation and has been perpetually updated since.
“I believe the state needs to fulfill its constitutional obligation to fund public K-12 education. Not run those schools but fund them,” Pillen said Tuesday. “If we are to get a grip on the state’s property tax crisis, we must be willing to address the ever-growing burden that falls on property tax as a result of footing the bill for our schools.”
TEEOSA components
In its most basic terms, TEEOSA diverts “equalization aid” to the public school districts it calculates have more “needs” than available “resources.”
“Needs” is calculated among 18 buckets, including a district’s concentrations of poverty, students with limited English proficiency, transportation needs and student growth.

“Resources” includes six buckets of funds, including estimates of property taxes that could be raised with a $1 tax levy and net option enrollment funds.
The formula diverts about $1.2 billion among 245 school districts each year. An increasing number of districts do not receive any TEEOSA aid under the formula, which is why Pillen and other senators in 2023 created a new form of “foundation aid,” which distributes roughly $1,500 to school districts for each student served. About 60% of foundation aid is now considered a “resource” under TEEOSA.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, vice chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee, led the creation of the commission after past legislative attempts to do so fell short. Hughes ultimately secured a spot on the commission herself and has pledged to continue working to address school finance.
The commission membership was specifically designed to include education representatives from school districts of all sizes, postsecondary education and taxpayers.

Property tax focus
Three former senators also joined the commission, notably former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area and State Treasurer Tom Briese, a former state senator from Albion. Both were instrumental in establishing “foundation aid” with Pillen and shifting the property tax portion of community college funding — nearly $300 million — onto state income and sales taxes in 2023.
Those changes helped reduce property taxes statewide by $6 million out of a $5.3 billion statewide total when property taxes were sent to Nebraskans in December 2024, the first reduction in property taxes paid in 26 years. 
In 2022 and 2023, property taxes had grown by nearly $300 million annually. And with property tax relief legislation stalling this spring, Pillen has estimated that taxpayers will see tax increases when tax bills go out this year.
Linehan, a former Revenue Committee chair of six years and a key ally of Pillen’s, proposed her own legislation to amend TEEOSA, largely focused on the “resources” side of the equation.

Briese, too, has continued to echo calls to have the state take on more school operational expenses, similar to what happened with community colleges in the 2023 bill led by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the Education Committee chair, who will also serve on the new commission.
TEEOSA had been eyed as the main vehicle to distribute more state aid to the state’s 245 school districts for operational expenses in lieu of property taxes.
The other former state senator named to the commission is Fred Meyer of St. Paul whom Pillen appointed to succeed Briese in the Legislature in late 2023, when Briese became treasurer.
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln rounds out the current legislative members with Murman and Hughes, each of whom will serve as nonvoting commissioners.
Hughes said in a text that she is “thrilled” about the commission membership and her own legislative appointment. She said she is ready to “get going and dive in.”
“I think the makeup of the committee is good, and there’s a lot of knowledge about TEEOSA, so we should be able to hit the ground running,” Hughes said.
‘Something of substance’
  Brian Maher, Nebraska education commissioner, testifies before the Legislature’s Education Committee. July 31, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Maher previously told the Nebraska Examiner it would be an “honor” to chair the commission. He said a lot of time has already gone into thinking how the first meeting would be structured to bring people together “to not just meet, but to have something of substance done that we can give to the Legislature for their consideration.”
The commission has no expiration date. Some lawmakers have referred to TEEOSA as being on “autopilot,” Maher said, and while he might not “exactly agree,” he said it “might be pretty close.”
Maher, a former superintendent of Kearney Public Schools and Centennial Public Schools, said it’s probably time to rethink what school funding should look like generally in the state and not just tweak TEEOSA.
“I think if we can get about that answer and not worrying about TEEOSA,” Maher said, “I think maybe we can either say we’ve got the best model out there already, or here’s a new model for consideration.”



School Financing Review Commission membership
The full commission membership, as of July 10, is as follows, with one vacancy for a certified public school teacher:

Education Commissioner Brian Maher (chair)
Nebraska Property Tax Administrator Sarah Scott
Grant Latimer, policy adviser to Gov. Jim Pillen (governor’s representative)
Chancellor Paul Turman of the Nebraska State College System
Superintendent Ann Foster of Brady Public Schools
Superintendent Jason Dolliver of Pender Public Schools

State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil (Education Committee chair, nonvoting member)
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln (Revenue Committee representative, nonvoting member)
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward (at-large lawmaker, nonvoting member)

“I appreciate the commitment of these dedicated public servants who, like me, want to ensure the quality of our state’s education but recognize the need to balance that investment with smart tax policy, making us more competitive with our neighboring states so we can grow Nebraska,” Pillen said Tuesday. “We are fortunate to have leadership on this commission ready to begin this important initiative.”

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Nebraska Examiner)President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York, and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)In another major legal win in the fight against the opioid crisis, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Thursday that the commonwealth could receive up to $16.4 million as part of a sweeping $720 million multi-state settlement with eight generic drug manufacturers accused of flooding communities with addictive painkillers.
“Years ago, pharmaceutical companies exploited Virginians, treating them like test subjects while pushing dangerous, addictive drugs into our communities while lining their pockets,” Miyares said in a statement. 
“Though no settlement can erase the heartbreak and lives lost to the opioid crisis, I’m proud of my office for fighting to secure over $16 million to help Virginians heal, support recovery, and hold these companies accountable for the devastation they profited from.”
The settlement includes Mylan (now part of Viatris), Hikma, Amneal, Apotex, Indivior, Sun, Alvogen, and Zydus — companies that will pay a combined total of $720 million over various timeframes. 
Mylan will contribute the largest share, paying more than $284 million over nine years. Other payments include $95 million from Hikma, $71 million from Amneal, and $63 million from Apotex. Alvogen, Zydus and Apotex will make one-time payments, while others will pay over several years.
Beyond the money, the agreement imposes new restrictions. Seven of the eight companies are now prohibited from marketing or promoting opioids, barred from producing pills containing more than 40 milligrams of oxycodone and required to implement systems to detect and report suspicious orders.
Indivior, known for its medications used in opioid addiction treatment, agreed to halt production and sales of opioid products for 10 years, though it can continue selling treatments for opioid use disorder.
Virginia helped negotiate the deal alongside attorneys general from California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.
The announcement marks another step in Virginia’s broader legal effort to hold opioid manufacturers accountable — efforts that have now resulted in over $1.1 billion in secured settlements for the state. 
Just last month, Miyares announced Virginia’s role in a separate, high-profile $7.4 billion national settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family that would dissolve the family’s ownership of the company and permanently bar them from marketing opioids in the United States.
Virginia stands to receive up to $103.8 million from the Purdue deal, with the majority of the funds arriving in the first three years. The money will be channeled into prevention, treatment, and long-term recovery programs through the state’s Opioid Abatement Authority.
“The Sacklers spent years fueling an epidemic that shattered families, wrecked communities, and cost hundreds of thousands of American lives,” Miyares said in announcing the Purdue deal. 
“Though no amount of money will ever bring back those we’ve lost or undo the incomprehensible level of harm caused, these settlement funds will be invested in treatment, prevention, and recovery efforts across Virginia, helping our communities heal and saving lives.”
The impact of the opioid crisis in Virginia has been especially severe. 
A 2021 analysis by Virginia Commonwealth University and the Virginia Department of Health found nearly 150,000 Virginians living with opioid use disorder. At least six Virginians died each day, on average, from opioid overdoses that year.
By 2022, fentanyl — a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin — was responsible for more than 1,900 deaths in Virginia, more than double the toll from a decade earlier. 
However, early signs of progress are emerging. Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show a 44% drop in fentanyl-related deaths in Virginia in 2024, marking the second-largest such decline in the country.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In the wake of the June assassination of a top Minnesota lawmaker, Oklahoma’s legislative leaders from both parties want to know if security can be considered an officeholder expense. 
In their letter, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City and House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, asked the state’s Ethic’s Commission to to determine if Oklahoma elected officials can legally use campaign donations to cover the cost of security measures.
The Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to provide an advisory opinion, which they expect to publish ahead of their next meeting scheduled for Aug. 14. 
The opinion would relate to only officeholders, not candidates for political office. 
“The tragic assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman by shooting at her home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota last month has emphasized to me the need to evaluate what can be done to prevent such an awful event from occurring in Oklahoma,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to the Commission’s Executive Director Lee Anne Bruce Boone. “I am exploring how we can find a way to help provide security measures in our members’ residences. I know this can be costly. I am also aware that not everyone has the personal resources to install these kind of measures.” 
Hortman, a member of the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and House Speaker Emerita, and her husband were assassinated in their home in June. 
Authorities allege Vance Boelter, 57, posed as a police officer to gain entrance to their home. He shot and killed Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, authorities said. He’s also accused of shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife that same night. 
Boelter was later arrested and faces state and federal charges. The U.S. Attorneys’ Office charged Boelter with two counts of murder, two counts of stalking and two weapons charges. The federal murder charges carry the potential for the death penalty. 
Investigators said he had a list of other potential targets, including Democratic elected officials. 
Hoffman was released from the hospital Monday. He and his wife are recovering. 
The assassinations have led to public officials across the U.S. feeling on edge and weighing the cost of public service. 
The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation opened half a dozen investigations into threats against public officials in the state in 2024 and 2025. 
Hunter McKee, a spokesperson for the agency, said the Bureau investigates many potential threats to Oklahoma officials but not all reach the point of open investigations. Other law enforcement agencies also assist in these investigations, he said. 
The lawmakers’ letter also referenced the Federal Election Commission’s guidance, which allows certain reasonable security devices and services to be paid for with campaign funds to address ongoing dangers and threats. 
Bruce Boone said several states allow security measures for officeholders with different restrictions. Some states have dollar limits, some are approved on a case-by-case basis and some must meet certain criteria to ensure the expense isn’t for personal use. 
“Because of the concern of these threats, it would be nice to have a way to ensure that they have this security device if they feel like that’s something that’s needed,” she said. “I think that dollar limit is something that the Legislature was very interested in us pursuing … as well ensuring, what would happen at the end of their term or at the end of their time in office? What would happen with that equipment? I think we would have to flesh all that out in the advisory opinion.”
Adam Weintraub, vice chair of the Ethics Commission, said if security is an allowable expense, limits or regulations need to be in place. 
“There’s a real difference between somebody who’s putting an alarm on their house and making it part of the house, and somebody who’s adding to their gun collection,” he said. 
While an advisory would help to interpret and explain the rules, adding specific parameters would require a rule change, said Margaret Kerr, the Commission’s general counsel. Administrative rule changes would require legislative approval.

Delaware drivers will soon pay more at toll booths and the DMV as the state moves forward with new transportation funding measures set to take effect later this year.
Following the passage of House Bill 164 and a resolution signed by Secretary of Transportation Shanté Hastings, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) announced toll and fee increases that are expected to generate an additional $107 million annually for infrastructure improvements across the state.
Toll increases begin August 15
Starting Friday, August 15, tolls on Delaware’s three major toll roads — I-95 in Newark, US 301, and State Route 1 — will rise for most drivers:

I-95 (Newark): Two-axle vehicles will see tolls increase from $4.00 to $5.00, for both cash and E-ZPass users.
US 301 (Mainline): E-ZPass tolls will increase from $4.00 to $5.00. Drivers using the toll-by-plate system will pay $7.00, up from $5.60.
SR 1 (Biddles Corner and Dover):

Delaware E-ZPass holders will pay $1.50 on weekdays and $4.00 on weekends.
Non-Delaware E-ZPass and cash users will be charged $2.50 on weekdays and $6.00 on weekends.



Toll rates for vehicles with additional axles and at other US 301 interchanges will vary.
Full details are available on DelDOT’s website and will be reflected in an updated toll calculator by August 1.

DMV fee changes take effect October 1
In addition to toll increases, several DMV fees will rise beginning October 1.
This includes a 1% increase in the vehicle document fee and the introduction of a new annual registration fee for alternative fuel vehicles.
The new registration fee will apply to more than 48,000 vehicles statewide.
Delaware residents without an E-ZPass account can sign up and view rates here. Additional information about the alternative fuel vehicle fee and how it will be collected is expected later this year.

“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Among the state’s cases are two unvaccinated pregnant Utahns. People who become infected with measles during pregnancy are more likely to experience severe symptoms, and are at high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or giving birth to a child who will experience serious medical problems, health officials warned. Because the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is not available for people are are already pregnant, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services urged anyone who is thinking of getting pregnant to first receive the vaccine at least four weeks before attempting pregnancy.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota Native tribes and a group of tribal citizens plan to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a court decision that found they don’t have standing to sue the state of North Dakota for alleged voter discrimination.
The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in the ruling concluded that private voters have no way of challenging unfair voting practices under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voter discrimination based on race.
“That decision is plainly wrong, and it will have a huge impact on Native voters,” Lenny Powell, a Native American Rights Fund attorney representing the plaintiffs, said in a Tuesday statement. 
The ruling came in a case involving the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal members, who took North Dakota to court over a 2021 redistricting map the tribes say illegally diluted the power of Native voters.
Court denies rehearing voting rights case; group calls decision ‘loss for Native American voters’

North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 sided with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to adopt a different map.
A panel of three 8th Circuit Court of Appeals judges in May voted 2-1 to reverse that finding. The panel indicated it would send the case back to Welte and direct him to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to go into effect, this decision would reinstate the original 2021 map.
The plaintiffs asked the full 8th Circuit to rehear the case, though the court denied that request last week.
Now the plaintiffs are gearing up to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. In a brief filed Wednesday, the plaintiffs asked the 8th Circuit to allow Welte’s map to stay in place until the high court decides whether it will weigh in.
The 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit to find that private individuals cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The court in a 2023 decision in a separate case found that it’s the sole responsibility of the U.S. attorney general to enforce compliance with Section 2.
The 8th Circuit’s findings in the North Dakota case reaffirmed this position. The plaintiffs had attempted to use a separate civil rights statute, Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as an alternative means of bringing their voting rights claim, but the three-judge panel ruled this was not possible.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

While it’s very rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to hear a case, the plaintiffs in their most recent brief argued that the high court may be interested in the lawsuit because of the importance of voting rights and to resolve the different positions the 8th Circuit and other circuits have taken on the issue.
Because of the circuit split, the plaintiffs think there is a “reasonable probability” that at least four of the nine justices on the Supreme Court will want to review the case.
The plaintiffs are hopeful the Supreme Court will ultimately reverse the 8th Circuit’s decision. 
The Supreme Court has always allowed private individuals to file discrimination claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, they argue in the brief.
North Dakota maintains that the 2021 map is not discriminatory and that the tribes lack standing to sue.
The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.

,DC,2025-07-10 18:41:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump emergency tariffs violate Constitution, Democrats argue in court case",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-emergency-tariffs-violate-constitution-democrats-argue-court-case,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Democratic lawmakers argued in a new legal filing this week that President Donald Trump’s sweeping emergency tariffs usurped congressional power, and they urged a federal appellate court to strike down the duties on foreign imports.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is set to hear oral arguments over some of Trump’s tariffs after a lower court blocked them in May. Despite being tied up in court, Trump continued threatening tariffs Wednesday on numerous trading partners, including a 50% import tax on goods from Brazil.Nearly 200 lawmakers signed onto the amicus brief Tuesday, asserting that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, under which Trump triggered the duties, “does not confer the power to impose or remove tariffs.”The lawmakers argued that Trump’s unprecedented use of IEEPA violates Article I of the U.S. Constitution that authorizes Congress to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises” and “regulate commerce with foreign nations.”“This reflects the Framers’ interest in ensuring the most democratically accountable branch — the one closest to the People — be responsible for enacting taxes, duties, and tariffs,” wrote the 191 Democratic members of Congress, citing the Federalist Papers, in their 65-page brief.Congress has “explicitly and specifically” delegated tariff-raising powers to the president, but not under IEEPA, according to the lawmakers.“Unmoored from the structural safeguards Congress built into actual tariff statutes, the President’s unlawful ‘emergency’ tariffs under IEEPA have led to chaos and uncertainty,” the lawmakers wrote.‘Economic chaos,’ price hikes citedSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, co-led the brief with Oregon’s Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also co-led, along with Reps. Gregory Meeks of New York, Joe Neguse of Colorado, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Richard Neal of Massachusetts.In a statement Wednesday, Shaheen said Trump’s “reckless tariff agenda has caused economic chaos and raised prices for families and businesses across the country at a moment in which the cost of living is far too high.”“The Trump Administration’s unlawful abuse of emergency powers to impose tariffs ignores that he does not have the authority to unilaterally impose the largest tax increase in decades on Americans. This brief makes clear that IEEPA cannot be used to impose tariffs,” Shaheen said.May decisionThe U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs in a May 28 decision, following two legal challenges brought by a handful of business owners and a dozen Democratic state attorneys general.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among the states that brought the suit.The lead business plaintiff is V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, according to its website. Other plaintiffs include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Following an appeal from the White House, the Federal Circuit allowed Trump’s tariffs to remain in place while the case moved forward.Triple-digit tariffTrump used IEEPA to declare international trade a national emergency and announced tariffs on nearly every other country on April 2 in what he dubbed as “Liberation Day.”Tariffs reached staggering levels on major U.S. trading partners, including 46% on Vietnam, 25% on South Korea and 20% on the European Union.The announcement wiped trillions from markets, which have largely recovered. Trump delayed all but a 10% base tariff for 90 days on every country except China. Trump fueled a trade war with the massive Asian nation, peaking at a 145% tariff rate, but then temporarily settling between 10% and 55%, depending on the good.Even before Trump shocked the world with his “Liberation Day” announcement, small business owners from around the U.S. told States Newsroom they were bracing for potentially devastating economic effects.The trade court’s ruling — a pending appeals litigation — does not apply to tariffs Trump imposed under other statutes, including national security-related duties on foreign automobiles, as well as steel and aluminum. Some of the steel tariffs, imposed during Trump’s first term, were left in place under former President Joe Biden.",,,,2025-07-10 15:11:38.874754

Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for the town. Now, she said, President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill could snatch it away. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.
Mayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”
“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”
Now, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.

This week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.
Republicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.
The Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.
Residents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.
“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Medicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.
Even though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.
On a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.
“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

Ervin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.
Ervin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.
In East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.
Expansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.
“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.
It’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.
Greenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.
Greenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.
  April McNair, 45, is a resident of Greenville, Miss. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
The result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.
“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”
McNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.
“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.
“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”
 Hard to thrive

Mississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.
Delta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.
It was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.
But it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”

The situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.
People who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.
Black residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.
A 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”
“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.
Even some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.
“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”
Richardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.
“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.
That’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.
“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”

In Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.
“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.
“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”
Now, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.










America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.


– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System


In East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.
Brown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.
“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”
Local infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.
“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.
Dominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.
“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.
  Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)
Even a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.
Nevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.
“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.
At the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.
“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”
 ‘The tremble factors’

While leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.
Morris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.
“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”

Morris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.
Morris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.
But Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.
Mississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.
“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.
Leonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.
Glaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment

“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.
“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”
National researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.
But national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.
Experts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.
State Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.
Depending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.
Last week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”
From her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.
Newton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.

Newton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”
In 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.
“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”
Republican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”
Medicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.
“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”
Congressional Republicans target tax that provides billions to Missouri Medicaid program

But advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren’t working enough.
“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Data shows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.
 ‘Take a step back’

People in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.
“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”
Lake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.
Recent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.
“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham said she’s “incredibly confident” that President Donald Trump will approve emergency federal funds by Thursday afternoon for the devastating Ruidoso floods, as the area braces for further rains forecasted Friday.
NM Gov seeks federal help for Ruidoso flooding that killed 3

Lujan Grisham made her remarks during a news conference in Ruidoso Thursday morning alongside local officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation. She noted that U.S. Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem had offered reassurances that federal aid was incoming, including $12 million in previous funds allocated to local officials by the federal government, and potentially $3 million dollars following the approval of the disaster declaration.
“They are already working on getting us the money immediately,” Lujan Grisham said. “That is a very good sign.”
Local and state officials are working to tally the damages in the wake of a 20-foot flash flooding roaring through Ruidoso from rain sluicing off burn scars from fires in 2024. The waters rose on Tuesday afternoon, upending homes, carrying off vehicles and requiring 65 water rescues. Two children, ages 7 and 4, and a man in his 40s or 50s died.
Lujan Grisham expressed her condolences over the lost lives, and said that recovery efforts and safety efforts would need to move quickly to assess the losses and start working to “manage and mitigate the damages, to protect us from more water that is coming.”
One person remains unaccounted for, but search and rescue operations are moving to wrap up Thursday, according to Lincoln County Emergency Manager Eric Holt.

The next stage is working to remove silt from the riverbeds and clear debris before further anticipated rains. The National Guard and local officials set up an Emergency Operations Center to coordinate emergency alerts.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, also spoke at the news conference and urged residents to heed any further evacuation warnings in the coming days, warning that flooding may continue throughout the monsoon season.
“We cannot lose another life,” she said. “It’s really important over the coming days that everyone follow those emergency orders, and we’re going to do everything we can to get dollars, humans, and rescue folks on the ground to make sure that we protect our community.”
Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) whose 2nd Congressional District includes parts of the nearby Mescalero Apache tribal lands and Otero County, said the delegation would continue to pursue additional federal funds.
“We have to make sure that at a state and federal level, we have the adequate resources to be able to handle this in our communities,” he said. “Understand this perhaps is no longer going to be a historic event, but it could be something that we have to face year after year.”
Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford said damages from the flood are in the tens of millions of dollars between bridges, homes and other infrastructure. The floods also stopped water services for about 300 homes. City officials expected further water deliveries Thursday afternoon and asked any residents in need of service to go to the Convention Centers.
“After yesterday, it became very apparent that there was a lot more damage than what we had assumed,” Crawford said.
The water system, which was damaged during the South Fork and Salt wildfires last year, is not experiencing any water quality issues, said Ron Sena, the manager for Ruidoso Village. The outages are in parts of the main drag on Sudderth Drive, and the Upper Camelot and Black Forest neighborhoods.
It will probably take days to restore full water service, Crawford told Source NM.
Lujan Grisham said the efforts are currently focused on short-term recovery, but that the area will need hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to recover in the future.
“This community should expect in the next day and days and weeks, tens of millions of dollars making its way over, and the coming months, $100 million or more,” she said. “Overall, we’ve got a long way to go, we’re talking about sizable resources to recover this community.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gov-1_Prokop-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-10 15:11:38.874754

Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday announced two new leadership appointments of state environmental departments. 
Jason Batchelder, who most recently served as the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, is set to become commissioner of the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. Having previously served as colonel of Fish & Wildlife’s warden service, Batchelder replaces interim Commissioner Andrea Shortsleeve. 
“I’m truly humbled to be asked to rejoin this group of mission-driven individuals who live their work, day in and day out,” Batchelder said in a Wednesday press release. 
Scott selected Misty Sinsigalli to replace Batchelder as commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation. She joins the department having previously worked as a disaster recovery lead for the water and environmental programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development, according to the release. 
“Misty’s experience at the federal level, as well as her lived experience growing up in Vermont, will be important as we balance conservation with the housing we desperately need in the state,” Scott said in the release. 
Sinsigalli said in the release that she was grateful to lead the department during a challenging time, noting uncertainty in both the physical environment and Washington, D.C.

Scott also appointed Sara Teachout to the Green Mountain Care Board, a key health care regulator in the state. Teachout most recently worked as a lobbyist for BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont, a health insurer the care board regulates. Care board members are chosen from a list of candidates submitted by the board’s nominating committee. 
Teachout told VTDigger on Thursday that she had resigned from BlueCross and would not participate in this year’s health insurance rate review process. She has almost 20 years of experience in health care policy and fiscal analysis, according to the release.

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)Litigation over Gov. Kim Reynolds’ 2021 refusal to pay pandemic-related jobless assistance to 30,000 Iowans is continuing with a newly filed lawsuit alleging the governor’s decision was unlawful.
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court, mirrors claims made by the same plaintiffs, Karla Smith of Pleasantville and Holly Bladel of Clinton, in a 2021 state-court lawsuit that was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs before being refiled in 2023 in federal court.
The federal lawsuit was dismissed by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Stephanie M. Rose, partly due to jurisdictional issues. Rose ruled that one of the lawsuit’s central claims, which cited federal statutes, could not be based on “a violation of state law – even state constitutional law.” Rose also concluded the plaintiffs “did not have a continuing, constitutionally protected property interest in the pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
On June 3, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Eighth Circuit affirmed Rose’s decision. That same day, lawyers for Smith and Bladel filed their new lawsuit in state court, claiming the two women and thousands of other Iowans were illegally denied unemployment benefits in 2021 due to the actions of Reynolds and Iowa Workforce Development Director Beth Townsend.
According to the lawsuit, Reynolds and Townsend violated Iowa’s Employment Security law, which requires the state to “cooperate with the United States Department of Labor to the fullest extent” and make available to Iowans “all advantages available under the provisions of the Social Security Act that relate to unemployment compensation.”
Lawyers for Smith and Bladel are also seeking class-action status in the case in an effort to recover damages for thousands of Iowans who may have been harmed by Reynolds’ decision.
While the state has yet to file a response to the latest lawsuit, the claims were rejected by Reynolds in 2023 when she defended her actions by saying “the federal government doesn’t get to run” the state of Iowa.
“Paying people to stay home at a time when there are more jobs available than people to fill them defies common sense. Iowans know there is dignity in work,” Reynolds said then.
Ohio court recently ruled on issue
Iowa was one of at least 25 states, all led by Republican governors, that chose to terminate federal, pandemic-related unemployment assistance to jobless residents before the programs expired in 2021. The states did so largely in response to labor shortages, claiming the enhanced benefits were encouraging people to remain unemployed rather than return to the workforce.
Ohio was one of those states — and five months ago, in February 2025, as part of a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of Ohio residents, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas ruled that Gov. Mike DeWine  must reinstate Ohio’s Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program and “take all action necessary to obtain Ohio’s share of FPUC program benefits from the Department of Labor.”
The State of Ohio is now appealing the ruling in an effort to block the federal government’s payment of pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
The litigation in Iowa, Ohio and other states stems from Congress’s March 2020 decision, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, to approve the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security — better known as the CARES Act — to address mass layoffs, business closures and soaring unemployment.
The act provided enhanced unemployment benefits, provided for cash payments to be made to qualified recipients, extended the period of eligibility for benefits, and allowed for benefits to be paid to people who wouldn’t otherwise have been eligible.
Iowans later received letters from Iowa Workforce Development stating they would be eligible for the benefits through Sept. 4, 2021. However, in a May 10, 2021, memorandum, Townsend recommended that Reynolds terminate Iowa’s participation in the federal programs effective June 12, 2021.
The next day, Reynolds officially adopted the recommendation and announced that IWD, which administers many elements of Iowa’s unemployment programs, would be withdrawing from participation in the federal, pandemic-related unemployment programs, despite the fact that they were entirely funded by the federal government.
Iowa’s participation in the programs was terminated on June 12, three months before the programs were set to expire.
At the time, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee warned that Iowa and other states that pulling out of the unemployment programs stood to lose up to $13 billion in economic activity by refusing the infusion of federal money.
Plaintiffs sue over ‘life-sustaining benefits’
Like the previously filed federal lawsuit over Reynolds’ actions, the new, state-court lawsuit alleges the Iowa governor’s “refusal to ensure continued access to federal pandemic-related unemployment benefits” deprived approximately 30,000 Iowans of “life-sustaining benefits” to which they were entitled. The lawsuit also notes that the number of Iowans affected by Reynolds’ decision might exceed 55,000.
The governor’s decision to prematurely terminate Iowa’s involvement in the programs “violated clear legislative mandates and constituted an unlawful exercise of executive authority,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Iowa’s Employment Security Law specifically required the state to provide citizens with “all advantages available under the provisions of the Social Security Act that relate to unemployment compensation.”
Smith, who worked at Casey’s General Store when the pandemic hit, alleges that in mid-March 2020, her doctor told her a preexisting lung condition made it dangerous for her to continue working in a retail setting that had yet to install Plexiglas dividers at workstations and didn’t require face masks.
Smith alleges she quit her job to self-quarantine and began collecting PEUC benefits of $408 per week in addition to FPUC benefits to pay for food, housing, and other monthly expenses. Reynolds’ and Townsend’s decision to terminate Iowa’s involvement in the federal programs left Smith without a critical source of income just as the Delta variant surged, the lawsuit claims.
Bladel worked for a restaurant and gas station but was replaced after seeking time off to care for an elderly relative who was immunocompromised and at risk for COVID-19. She then began collecting PUA and FPUC benefits until Iowa terminated its involvement in the programs.
The lawsuit is one of two active cases the plaintiffs are pursuing in state court over the unemployment issue. The other case, initiated in November 2024, is basically an appeal of the administrative decisions made by the state, and seeks judicial review of those decisions.
In that case, the state is seeking dismissal of the lawsuit and has accused the plaintiffs of having “shopped their lawsuit around first to state court, then to federal court, and now they are back to state court.”

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)Gov. Henry McMaster recently held a ceremonial bill signing for H.3430, the tort reform bill, which he hailed as a “great victory.”
The new law will take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, but before then, we think South Carolinians deserve a clear-eyed account of what happened — and what’s still at stake.
This legislative session opened with what we saw as a sweeping effort to roll back victims’ rights. S.244 was a bill that aimed to rewrite the long-standing liability laws that are imperative to protecting everyday people who are harmed by the negligent, the reckless, and the outright dangerous.
After weeks of debate and the hard work of legislators and individuals who fought to protect the safety and rights of all South Carolinians, some of the most dangerous provisions of that original bill were removed.
Our collective efforts to raise awareness and push for victims to be kept at the forefront of decision-making made a significant difference. Unfortunately, we believe the final legislation, H.3430, still creates serious problems for victims seeking justice.
Firstly, H.3430 permits blame-shifting loopholes by allowing the addition of non-parties on jury verdict forms. People or entities who aren’t even in the courtroom could be added and may never be held responsible, leaving victims to pick up the bill for medical costs, lost wages, and long-term financial hardships.
That undermines the very concept of accountability in our civil justice system.
Secondly, H.3430 does not include stronger penalties for drunken driving, a solution that would actually help lower liability rates.
South Carolina is currently ranked worst in the nation for DUI fatality rates, which is one of the reasons our liability rates are so high. An alternative reform bill, passed unanimously by the House, H.3497, included additional DUI penalties, but that bill ultimately did not pass the Senate.
Our state’s embarrassing DUI rates should be a wake-up call to legislators that something must be done, yet when given the opportunity to address this crisis, we did not, and H.3430 does nothing to deter drunken driving or help victims.
Finally, and perhaps most frustratingly, while H.3430 has been sold as a solution to skyrocketing insurance costs, there’s still no guarantee that premiums will go down — not for restaurant owners, not for consumers, not for anyone.
During weeks of testimony and debate, we did not see a single representative from the insurance industry testify that the proposed bill would guarantee lower rates.
What is guaranteed? That insurance companies will continue to grow their profits while facing less scrutiny and fewer obligations to the people they serve.
This bill didn’t fix a crisis. It simply passed the burden onto victims.
H.3430 was just the beginning; another threat to victims’ rights is already being planned.
But when the next attempt to undermine the protection of innocent South Carolinians is revealed, lawyers, victims, and small business owners will once again be ready to stand up and fight back, together.
We are closely watching other states, like Florida, where a state committee is now investigating whether insurers misled lawmakers by hiding billion-dollar profits while claiming extensive losses, which contributed to the passage of a sweeping tort reform package in 2023.
And we’re building even stronger support and alliances to fight for the rights of victims across our state. To the advocates, survivors, business owners, and everyday folks who stood up against the bill this year: thank you. Your calls, your testimony, and your engagement made a significant difference.
The fight for justice is far from over, but our commitment is deep-seated and unwavering.
The South Carolina Association for Justice and our partners will always fight for victims.
We will always stand for accountability. And we will never stop working to protect the rights of all South Carolinians.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_4613-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit thisweek challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.

Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregonreported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Menhaden, also known as pogy, are small foraging fish that live in large shoals off the Gulf Coast. Rich in omega-3 fats and oils, the fish are harvested primarily for pet food, dietary supplements and food ingredients. 
Funded with $1 million from the Louisiana Legislature and overseen by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, the LGL study found menhaden harvesting unintentionally caught an estimated 145 million fish of other species, or bycatch, during the 2024 season, which went from April through October.
Researchers worked aboard commercial pogy boats for seven months counting fish and conducting experiments to determine what kills the bycatch species and what helps them survive. Data was collected from these at-sea observers and electronic monitoring such as on-board cameras. 
Although they recorded dozens of different species in the bycatch, the researchers focused much of their attention on redfish, one of the most coveted targets of Gulf Coast recreational anglers.
Much of the unintentionally caught fish is retained and processed along with the menhaden, but a significant portion is discarded back into the sea dead or injured. The total dead fish that menhaden boats discarded last year included an estimated 22,000 redfish, 9,000 black drum, 33,000 catfish and 10,000 sharks, among other species. 
Still, the number of redfish killed and discarded by the commercial menhaden industry is less than the number discarded by recreational anglers, according to a Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries news release that compared the new research with separate data that did not appear in the study.

The agency noted the menhaden industry’s dead redfish bycatch accounted for 9.9% of the total redfish harvested in the state. The overwhelming share, 90.1%, are taken by recreational anglers, who keep 78.9% and discard and kill 11.2% of the total redfish, according to the Wildlife and Fisheries Department. The study made no mention of that recreational harvest data.
The research results come just over a year after the state Wildlife and Fisheries Commission placed tighter restrictions on redfish for recreational anglers, citing the species’ declining numbers. The agency lowered the daily catch limit from five to four per person and upped the minimum size limit from 16 inches to 18 inches. The changes drew outcry from charter boat captains who make their living taking clients out to catch redfish.  
Some blamed commercial fishing for the decline in redfish numbers. State lawmakers intervened with funding for the new bycatch study and pressed regulators to implement a menhaden exclusion zone that prohibits commercial fishing within a half-mile of land along much of the coastline and 3 miles in select areas. 
Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, who has spearheaded much of the menhaden industry legislation, said he was impressed with the study. In a phone interview Wednesday, Orgeron pointed to the finding that surprised him most: Bycatch survival was high for fish released directly from the nets but was very low for fish that enter the pogy boats’ chute systems. 
Those chute systems were designed to separate and release larger fish species that are unintentionally caught. When menhaden are corralled into what’s called a purse seine net, the bycatch species are also trapped. Crews use a large hose to vacuum the menhaden onto the boat, and on the front end of the hose is what the industry calls a “shark cage,” which is essentially a large metal screen that’s supposed to prevent larger fish from being vacuumed. 
But shark cage designs vary among companies, and the less effective cages do little to stop large fish and sharks from getting sucked into the hose alongside the menhaden, so the catch is pumped through a secondary excluder grate onboard the boat. Serving essentially like a second shark cage, the excluder grate is supposed to separate the bigger fish and then send them down a release chute back into the sea. 
However, researchers found that most of the larger fish that enter the chute system end up being dismembered before they even make it to the secondary excluder grate. So the very system designed to save the fish and release them back into the sea is actually killing them.

This is especially true for redfish, which had a mortality rate of 98% after entering the chute system. Other species had slightly better chances of surviving, but overall the system was a death sentence for the fish, the study found.
The findings have already prompted changes at one of the Gulf’s largest menhaden fleets, Ocean Harvesters. Ben Landry, the company’s vice president of public affairs, said all boats in their fleet now use a more effective hose cage to keep bycatch from entering the chute system. 
“We’ve seen some improvements in terms of what fish are coming up the chute,” Landry said in a phone call. 
Following Tuesday’s presentation, groups on opposite sides of the issue touted the study as vindication of their position.
Bob Vanasse, spokesperson for the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, said the study reaffirms that the menhaden industry is sustainable and poses no threat to Louisiana’s redfish populations. He pointed to a news release his organization published highlighting the large percentage of redfish removals attributed to recreational fishing. 
“This independent science reaffirms what we’ve always said: the Gulf menhaden fishery is guided by data, not politics or guesswork,” Vanasse said. “These findings must inform any future regulatory decisions. This is a model of how transparency, swift industry action, and investment in better gear deliver real conservation gains without compromising coastal jobs or economies.”
Richard Fischer, who heads the Louisiana Charter Boat Association, said the number of redfish the menhaden industry kills might be smaller in proportion but is still significant when considering other factors.
“I think recreational fishermen would argue that the economic impact they bring to the state, $3.1 billion annually, according to the American Sportfishing Association … is far greater than the economic impact the menhaden industry has on the state,” Fischer said. “There’s also a lot of other non-target species killed by the menhaden industry. Redfish is just the attention grabber.”
Researchers found other animals died after getting caught in the pogy nets. They included three brown pelicans and a laughing sea gull. Several protected species, including a giant manta ray, dolphins and sea turtles were unintentionally caught, but the boat crews were able to save and release them. 
Fischer said he hopes the study will help settle the disagreements and allow both sides — the recreational and commercial fisheries — to come together to find a solution that works for everyone.

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump Administration’s Health and Human Services Administration under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Supreme Court handed a legal loss Thursday to opponents of a Lincoln County prison site lawmakers have already abandoned.
In a unanimous ruling, the justices decided that Lincoln County residents don’t have the right to force the state to adhere to local zoning ordinances.
Representatives from the nonprofit organization Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion, or NOPE, sought to force the issue with a lawsuit filed in 2023, shortly after the state announced its decision to place a 1,500-bed men’s prison on farm ground about 14 miles south of Sioux Falls.
Prison opponents tell SD Supreme Court the state should have county permission to build

The neighbors wanted the state to seek a conditional use permit for the prison. The state argued that counties don’t have the authority to regulate what the state does with its own land.
The neighbors lost at the circuit court level, but appealed to the state’s high court. The justices heard arguments in March. 
The justices didn’t decide if the state has immunity from local zoning restrictions. Instead, they ruled that neighbors lack the legal standing to enforce those ordinances through a lawsuit, leaving the underlying question of the state’s authority to sidestep county rules untouched.
The practical weight of Thursday’s decision in the state’s ongoing prison debate is essentially null. The state’s Project Prison Reset task force voted earlier this year to scratch the original Lincoln County site from its list of options, and voted this week to recommend building on one of two vacant industrial sites on the northeastern edge of Sioux Falls.

(Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)Berkeley Township improperly denied a secession request from a neighborhood detached from the rest of the township by a 30-minute drive, several other towns, and more than a mile of water, New Jersey’s Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
Justice Anne Patterson, writing for a unanimous court, said South Seaside Park’s proposed deannexation from Berkeley Township “would not cause a significant injury to the Township’s well-being.”
The high court’s affirmation of lower court decisions is the latest shift in South Seaside Park’s more than decade-long effort to join the neighboring Borough of Seaside Park and split from Berkeley, a municipality with which it shares no border.
Geography played a major role in the court’s decision.
South Seaside Park is a barrier island community in Ocean County that sits across the Barnegat Bay from Berkeley.
To reach the opposite shore of the bay in Berkeley, South Seaside Park residents must embark on a 15-mile drive that runs through Seaside Park, Seaside Heights, Island Heights, Toms River, South Toms River, Beachwood, and Pine Beach.
“In the off-season, that trip can take a half hour, and during the summer, it can take forty-five minutes or more,” Patterson wrote.
Separate cable providers serve the township and South Seaside Park, and broadcasts of Berkeley’s public meetings are not carried on the latter’s network.
The distance and the sparseness of municipal facilities within South Seaside Park — it has a basketball court and a public beach with restrooms and one water fountain — meant denying the neighborhood’s request to deannex would harm its residents, the court ruled.
An attorney for the township did not immediately return a request for comment. Assemblyman Greg McGuckin (R-Ocean), who represented the South Seaside Park residents who brought the suit, declined to comment. His legislative district includes Seaside Park.
 It can take a half-hour or longer to get from the South Seaside Park neighborhood of Berkeley Township to mainland Berkeley on the other side of Barnegat Bay.
 Planning board rejection
Berkeley’s planning board in 2020 recommended rejecting South Seaside Park’s petition for deannexation after years of hearings, arguing the neighborhood’s residents had not shown the types of harms that would justify a split. Berkeley’s council followed those recommendations with a vote against deannexation.
But before the Supreme Court, Berkeley failed each leg of a three-prong test used to measure the validity of its rejection, and for the first time in such a case, the court found bias drove planning board recommendations against a neighborhood’s request to split with its municipality.
It found the planning board’s denial of South Seaside Park’s request to join Seaside Park was arbitrary or unreasonable because the board coordinated with Berkeley’s township council to oppose the move rather than acting as an impartial arbiter, as called for by the law.
The board’s planner, the court found, coordinated litigation strategy with the township, annotated transcripts to suggest themes for the township’s opposition, and helped prepare the township’s witnesses.
One board member who was also a member of the township council encouraged elderly residents to appear and oppose the proposal — then did not recuse from the matter, the court said.
“Even the professional planner retained by the Planning Board in this case acknowledged that a board reviewing a deannexation petition must act in an open-minded and unbiased manner, conducting the proceedings fairly and objectively assessing the evidence in its report to the governing body,” Patterson wrote. “Here, the Planning Board did not act in accordance with that standard.”
The case is the first deannexation matter to reach the high court with an allegation of bias. At least two cases involving allegations of bias previously came before appellate courts, but those courts rejected them. In one, they found a mayor’s comment against deannexation was inconsequential. In the other, planning board members who opposed deannexation recused themselves.
The high court acknowledged South Seaside Park’s departure would harm Berkeley Township taxpayers, who township officials said would see their property tax bills rise by an average $148 if the neighborhood deannexed.
South Seaside Park accounts for about 2% of Berkeley’s population and roughly 11% of its property tax base, experts for the neighborhood told the court.
But those costs would be at least partially offset by services — two police vehicles and auxiliary officers for the summer season, among others — the township would no longer have to provide to South Seaside Park.
The township’s remaining residents wouldn’t face social harms from the deannexation because South Seaside Park residents were already so removed from other residents, the court found.

He graduated as the valedictorian from James Valley Christian School in 2004 and obtained a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Dordt University in Iowa.
“I’m incredibly honored and grateful for the trust the governor has placed in me,” Wipf said in the release. “I will work hard to earn that same trust from the people of District 22.”
Wipf succeeds David Wheeler, a Republican and lawyer who resigned his state Senate seat in April to accept an appointment as a circuit court judge.

“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Many Connecticut residents are financially struggling, but it’s not half.
While no recent study has used a “paycheck-to-paycheck” framing, 39% of Connecticut households were struggling to make ends meet in 2022, including nearly 11% of families living in poverty, according to a 2024 report issued by the United Way in Connecticut.
The United Way uses a methodology called ALICE — Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed — identifying families unable “to afford the basic cost of living in their county” but often ineligible for public assistance programs. About 28.8% of the 39%, or 563,512 struggling households, were ALICE families.
A family of four needed over $113,000 annually in 2022 to cover basic costs.
Federal Reserve data shows that 18% of adults reported they couldn’t pay their bills in full in October 2022, with low-income households far more likely to fall short.

,DC,2025-07-10 17:14:09+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Senate GOP under pressure on Trump demand to defund NPR, PBS, foreign aid",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-under-pressure-trump-demand-defund-npr-pbs-foreign-aid,,"WASHINGTON — Congress has just one week left to approve the Trump administration’s request to cancel $9.4 billion in previously approved funding for public media and foreign aid, setting up yet another tight deadline for lawmakers. The Senate must pass the bill before July 18, otherwise the White House budget office will be required to spend the funding and be barred from sending up the same proposal again for what are called rescissions.But objections from several GOP senators could stop the legislation in its tracks, or change it substantially, requiring another House vote in a very short time frame. Rejecting the plan would represent a loss for the Trump administration after passage of the “big, beautiful” tax and spending cut law earlier this month.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., appears optimistic he can secure the votes needed to begin debate, though he hasn’t said publicly if he thinks the bill can actually pass. “We’ll have it up on the floor next week. Hopefully, we get on it and then we’ll have an amendment process,” Thune said during a Wednesday press conference. “And kind of like a budget reconciliation bill, it's an open amendment process, a vote-a-rama type process, which I’m sure you’re very excited about.”JD Vance needed again?At least 50 Republicans must agree to proceed to the legislation amid unified opposition from Democrats. Thune can only lose three GOP senators and still begin debate with Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote. Rescissions bills are exempt from the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.After a maximum of 10 hours of debate, the Senate will begin a marathon amendment voting session that could substantially reshape the measure.There may be enough Republican votes to completely remove the section rescinding $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and hundreds of local public media stations.Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds all brought up misgivings during a June hearing about how canceling previously approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would impact rural communities and emergency alerts.Collins, R-Maine, also raised concerns about the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back previously approved funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, and is likely to bring an amendment to the floor on that issue, according to her office. PEPFAR is a global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS that was led by President George W. Bush.Democrats will get to offer as many amendments as they want during the vote-a-rama and could try to remove each section of the bill one by one, forcing Republicans to weigh in publicly on numerous foreign aid programs.45 days for Trump requestPresident Donald Trump sent Congress the rescissions request in early June, starting a 45-day clock for lawmakers to consider his proposal.The recommendation asked lawmakers to cancel $8.3 billion in foreign aid funding, including $500 million for certain global health programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development.“This proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs,” the request states. “This rescission proposal aligns with the Administration's efforts to eliminate wasteful USAID foreign assistance programs.”The House voted mostly along party lines in mid-June to approve the rescissions request, but the legislation sat around the Senate for weeks as Republicans struggled to pass their “big, beautiful” law.The Senate can vote to approve the proposal as is, change it, or let it expire, forcing the White House budget office to spend the money, which it’s been able to legally freeze since sending Congress the rescissions request.Relations with White HouseSenators’ decision will impact how Republicans in that chamber, especially Thune and those on the Appropriations Committee, work with White House budget director Russ Vought in the coming months and years.Congress and the Trump administration must broker some sort of funding agreement before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1 to stave off a shutdown.Vought has also said he plans to send lawmakers additional rescissions requests, though he hasn’t said exactly when or what programs he’ll include.Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Thursday as the panel debated three of the full-year government funding bills that the rescissions package is not acceptable and could impede the committee’s traditionally bipartisan work.“We need to make sure decisions about what to fund and, yes, what to rescind are made here in Congress on a bipartisan basis and within our annual funding process,” Murray said. “We cannot allow bipartisan funding bills with partisan rescission packages. It will not work. And that is why I will repeat my commitment to all of my colleagues that on this side of the dais, we stand ready to discuss rescissions as part of these bipartisan spending bills.”",,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)After losing the Number One ranking to Virginia in 2024, North Carolina has reclaimed bragging rights as the Top State for Business in 2025 according to CNBC.
“Our people, state’s business climate, top research universities and excellent community college system, infrastructure, and high quality of life help both companies and workers thrive,” said Gov. Josh Stein on Thursday.
Stein praised state legislators of both parties as well as former Governor Roy Cooper in helping North Carolina create a welcoming business climate.
The high ranking from CNBC is nothing new for the state. Since 2007, North Carolina has enjoyed an average ranking of 4.5 in the survey under governors and legislatures led by both major parties. Its lowest ranking was 12th in 2013. It’s been ranked first, second or third since 2019, though no survey was published during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
CNBC’s annual ranking measures states across 10 categories of competitiveness. The categories where North Carolina demonstrated its biggest strengths this year were the economy, its workforce, and the state’s business friendliness. In a state of more than 11 million people, the unemployment rate stands at 3.7%.
The categories in which North Carolina received its lowest marks were quality of life (earning a C-) and cost of living (earning a C+) in the 2025 ranking.
“Our strength lies in our ability to connect companies with the workforce, infrastructure, sites, industry ecosystems, and innovation resources needed to support their growth, as well as a business-friendly environment that’s especially valuable in times of economic uncertainty,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina.
Since January, state commerce officials have announced business expansions or new projects yielding nearly $17 billion of new capital investment with an expectation of adding more than 20,000 new jobs. Last month, JetZero announced it would bring a $4.7 billion investment to Greensboro for its new production facility creating more than 14500 jobs by 2063. The announcement marked the largest economic development project in North Carolina history based on the job commitment.
Promoting the state, the promise of recovery
CNBC announced North Carolina’s Number One ranking Thursday in a televised interview with Gov. Stein in Wilmington on the USS North Carolina Battleship.
Stein used his time in the national spotlight to lift up western North Carolina and the tourism industry as it continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.
“We have a [new] ad campaign, which is ‘Rediscover the Unforgettable.’ People need to come to western North Carolina. If you’ve been here, you know what I’m talking about. And if you haven’t, you’ll be thrilled that you did,” said Stein in effort to promote a part of the state that sustained $60 billion in damages nine months ago.
Stein visited the Town of Clyde earlier this week to award one of the first grants from the Small Business Infrastructure Grant Program, which is helping local governments rebuild public infrastructure.
Helene left Clyde’s downtown six-to-eight feet underwater. This week told a much brighter story.
“I could not tell that from any storefront I walked in. Everyone was fresher than it has ever been,” Stein said in touting the speed at which some businesses have been able to reopen.

But Stein made clear in his CNBC interview that help from the federal government was still very much needed, even as the Trump administration has questioned whether FEMA should continue to provide states help.
“North Carolina is a bigger state than most. So, we have a pretty sophisticated emergency response team. But here’s the thing, we don’t get a huge storm every year. The country does,” reasoned Stein. “It doesn’t make sense for each state to have a fully staffed emergency response team because they may not have a storm for five-years or 10 years. But we know the country will.”
Stein reiterated that the state cannot bear the full cost of recovery, only the federal government can do that.
There’s currently an $11.5 billion request for storm recovery before Congress and the Trump administration.
“I eagerly hope they fund [it] soon,” said the governor.
New storm clouds on the horizon
Beyond natural disasters, Stein expressed concern that Trump’s one big, beautiful bill could mean billions of dollars in lost revenue for state’s Medicaid program.
“This bill is going to result in real harm to North Carolina, harm to our people, harm to our health care system,” said Stein.
A recent report by the General Assembly’s Fiscal Research Division highlights a $32 billion loss to the state budget and hospitals over the next decade.
Stein said the federal changes would result in hundreds of thousands of people potentially losing their health care coverage with rural hospitals feeling financial strain.

“Obviously we need to work with our North Carolina legislature to make sure that we don’t abandon the bipartisan win we had together,” said Stein.
Both House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate President Phil Berger praised the new CNBC business ranking on social media posts Thursday. Neither, however, mentioned the challenges Stein outlined, or news of any progress toward a final state budget, ten days into the new fiscal year.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Polk County water report pins unhealthy rivers on ag pollution

Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.
Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
Citizen scientists take to Iowa’s waters to monitor nitrate levels

“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)This is a breaking story and will be updated. 
A federal district court judge in New Hampshire said Thursday he will issue an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and will hold that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.
Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t currently have injunctions, but it will be stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.
Issued in January, the executive order, titled “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid. 
On Thursday, Laplante agreed.
“The deprivation of US citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the forthcoming ruling in a press conference after the hearing. 
“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”
Laplante’s ruling comes weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa, Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class action lawsuits: national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held. 
Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action lawsuit designation in order to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action lawsuit within days of the Casa decision in June. 
The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities. 
Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question. 
Lawyers for the plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action lawsuits, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants. 
Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.
Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.
“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said. 
The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there. 
Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump. In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order. In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4953-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

The governor joined five others, including Braun, of Centralia, to sign the voters’ pamphlet statement urging approval of Senate Joint Resolution 8201.
It is a “common sense measure that ensures tax dollars go further,” they wrote. It will “increase funding without impacting taxpayers” and “guarantee” benefits are there when individuals need them, it reads.
Four state lawmakers — a Democrat and three Republicans — penned the statement opposing the measure. They argue it would be “financial roulette” to put the money in “an unstable market.” Right now, “it’s safeguarded in secured investments like federal, state and municipal bonds which support our communities.”
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Seattle, is one of the signatories in the opposition camp.
“You are betting that corporations will maximize their profits, which always come off the backs of working people,” he said. “It’s really cynical to gamble that corporations are going to win.”
The playing field
WA Cares is funded with a 0.58% tax on the paychecks of most workers in Washington. Beginning in July 2026, those who qualify can begin accessing the program’s benefit, a lifetime amount of $36,500 — a sum that is set to rise in future years to account for inflation.
Collections by the state began in July 2023. A person pays as long as they are working in the state. Deductions stop if they retire, become unemployed or leave the workforce, and resume if the person returns to work. As of March, $2 billion in tax collections had been banked in the program’s trust fund.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies. That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds and certificates of deposit that are less risky. 
Senate Joint Resolution 8201, which passed by margins of 42-7 in the Senate and 86-9 in the House earlier this year, would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of funds exempt from that prohibition alongside the state’s pension and retirement funds.
Voters defeated a similar measure in 2020 by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. 
Those leading this year’s campaign said that they need to do a better job communicating that the Washington State Investment Board could produce higher earnings on WA Cares Fund assets that would translate into lower premiums and more benefits.
There were no lawmakers on the 2020 statement while the opposition had two — Hasegawa and the now-retired Republican state senator, Mike Padden.
Overall, the political environment is different, supporters said. The pandemic is over, the program is more widely understood and, last fall, voters rejected an initiative that sought to torpedo the program by making it voluntary rather than mandatory.
A campaign spokesperson said a recent internal polling found support in “the mid-50s.” At this point five years ago, the measure had only around 30% backing.
Those pushing the constitutional amendment note that some lawmakers who signed the opposition statement invest their money in the stock market.
Rep. Peter Abbarno, R-Centralia, who crafted the opposition statement with Hasegawa, is one.
“There is a big difference,” Abbarno said, “between a private individual who diversifies their portfolio versus a public official who invests somebody else’s money before knowing what the benefits will cost and what the exact design of the program will be. You have to be much more cautious when you have a fiduciary responsibility.”

Commissioner Brian Maher of Lincoln, 63, a lifelong educator who has served as state commissioner since July 2023, said his “vision” for NU is “a report card for the future” focused on achievement, alignment and a pathway for students to enter and succeed in NU, affordability in tuition and taxpayer dollars and enhancing NU’s appeal for in-state and out-of-state students.

Maher also said he would prioritize helping NU gain reinstatement into the prestigious American Association of Universities, a similar goal of Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, whom Maher is seeking to succeed. NU had been a member of the AAU for more than 100 years until it was voted out in 2011 for not meeting certain membership criteria.
“I’m running for the Board of Regents to ensure the next generation of Nebraskans has access to an affordable, high-quality education — and the opportunity to thrive here in our great state,” Maher said in a statement. “The University of Nebraska has given so much to my family. It’s time for us to give back.”
The District 1 seat Maher is running for is held by Clare, who told the Lincoln Journal Star in April that he would not seek a fourth six-year term next year. The district includes the northern half of Lincoln, as well as the surrounding communities of Emerald, Malcolm, Agnew, Raymond and Davey.
‘A report card for the future’
Maher is a first-generation college graduate who was born and raised in Hooper as the youngest of seven children. Maher and his wife Peg raised three children who were all educated at NU and competed in varsity athletics.
Across a 40-year career in education, Maher’s tenure includes being a teacher at Elkhorn and Clarks Public Schools; a school administrator at Waverly, Elkhorn and Johnson-Brock Public Schools; superintendent of Kearney and Centennial Public Schools in Nebraska, as well as at the Sioux Falls School District in South Dakota; and as CEO of the South Dakota Board of Regents (the Nebraska equivalent of NU president), where he served from 2020 to 2023 before returning to Nebraska.
Maher earned a doctorate in educational administration from NU. In 2015, he was awarded the “Nebraska Superintendent of the Year,” his final year in Kearney.

Maher enters the race with the endorsements of all eight members of the officially nonpartisan State Board of Education that selects an education commissioner. The members are four Republicans and four Democrats. 
The state board last month unanimously voted to extend Maher’s contract one more year, to July 2027. He was appointed in March 2023 on a 5-3 vote at a time when the board also was split 4-4, with one Republican joining Democrats.
The Republican members of the state board endorsing Maher are Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte (chair), Kirk Penner of Aurora, Sherry Jones of Grand Island and Lisa Schonhoff of Bennington. The Democratic board endorsing him are Deb Neary of Omaha (vice chair), Kristin Christensen of Lincoln, Maggie Douglas of Bellevue and Liz Renner of Omaha.
Former Lincoln Public Schools Superintendent Steve Joel also endorsed Maher.
Maher’s immediate predecessor, former Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt now works for NU as its associate vice president for government relations.
Commissioner decision, district boundaries
Campaign spokesperson Derek Oden said Maher “fully intends to continue faithfully serving” as commissioner through the campaign. If elected, Maher does intend to step down “to fully commit himself” to the NU Board of Regents.

That means the State Board of Education could be searching for a new ed commissioner in 2027, and the 2026 election could decide the partisan split of the board and the ease with which a new commissioner is selected. 
In 2026, the seats of three Republicans (Jones, Penner and Tegtmeier) and one Democrat (Neary) are up for election.
Maher joins the officially nonpartisan race for regent with Lincoln entrepreneur Brent Comstock, 29, who announced his candidacy in early June. Clare is a registered Republican, and so is Maher. Comstock is a registered nonpartisan. The NU board is currently 6-2 majority Republican.
Clare ran unopposed in 2014 and 2020 and won in 2008 with 58% of the vote. New district boundaries took effect in 2021 and match those of State Board of Education District 1, which elected newcomer Christensen with 58% of the vote in a highly watched election in November. She succeeded former State Board of Education member Patsy Koch Johns, a Democrat first elected in 2016.
The top two vote-getters in the May 2026 NU regents race will advance to the November 2026 election.

The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump Administration’s Health and Human Services Administration under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this week challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Mike Dunleavy said on Tuesday that the state has no such plans.
The Dunleavy administration statement was prompted by an inaccurate story by Newsweek that summarized the interview, asserting that the state had suggested the idea.
“The story is false,” said Jeff Turner, Dunleavy’s director of communications by email. He said that he had demanded a correction from the Newsweek reporter.
The Newsweek story referred to a July 1 interview on Fox News by host Laura Ingraham of Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for pPolicy and homeland security adviser. Miller is known as the architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, and a vocal proponent of ramping up ICE arrests, detention and mass deportations.
In the interview, Ingraham and Miller praised Florida for building a new ICE detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” for its isolation and being surrounded by wildlife in the Big Cypress Natural Preserve in Ochopee, Florida. It was constructed in just eight days, and can hold up to 3,000 detainees before deportation, and opened last week.
Miller said he had pitched all Republican governors to build similar ICE detention facilities. “We want every governor of a red state, and if you’re watching tonight, pick up the phone call, DHS, work with us to build facilities in your state,” Miller said.
Ingraham said Fox reached out to states, including Alaska, for comment. “Alaska told us that ‘we don’t have alligators, but we have lots of bears.’ However, they aren’t aware of any plans for an Alaska version,” she said.
“Of, I said, ‘Bear Alcatraz,’” Ingraham added, chuckling.
When asked to comment on Alaska’s response to Fox News, Turner repeated there were no state plans to build such a facility.
“I am not aware of any response from the state to Mr. Miller for a facility like the one in Florida,” Turner said. “The governor’s office was asked by Fox News if there were any such plans and the answer was no.”
Last week, President Donald Trump signed his signature domestic policy bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which allocates a historic increase of $165 billion to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which administers ICE, through 2029. ICE’s budget is currently $10 billion.
The Department of Homeland Security said $165 billion includes $45 billion for new ICE detention facilities, $46 billion for border wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border, $14 billion for deportation operations, and billions for hiring 6,000 new Customs and Border Patrol agents, and 10,000 new ICE agents.

U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten (D-Grand Rapids) hosted an online press conference Wednesday along with fellow west Michigan Democrats, state Sen. Sean McCann of Kalamazoo and state Rep. Carol Glanville of Walker, to discuss the legislation signed last week by President Donald Trump.
“This bill is not fiscally responsible, and this is something that matters deeply to me at a time when American debt is crippling our economy,” Scholten said.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could add $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years, according to its most recent analysis. It will make permanent the 2017 tax cuts from Trump’s first term and provide billions to carry out his plans of mass deportations, an immigration crackdown and increased defense spending.
But it’s the downstream effects the legislation will have on Michigan’s budget that was most concerning to McCann and Glanville.
“The state of Michigan is going to have to deal with the fallout from this. Our health care system is going to have to see the fallout from this,” McCann said. “Rural health care especially is going to suffer.”
McCann pointed to the Michigan Hospital Association’s recent statement that the Medicaid cuts in the bill would be “disastrous” for health care in the state.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“That really sends a signal to me, when you hear those kinds of statements coming out of an organization that typically stays out of the partisan fray of policymaking, but is weighing in heavily here with these warnings of the dire consequences of the situation,” McCann said.
Glanville said while the budget cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food assistance will have a devastating effect on the most vulnerable Michiganders, many other sectors of the state’s budget will also be impacted because of Republican’s emphasis on favoring the wealthiest Americans.
“The cost of utilities, child care, you name it, everything in our state budget is intertwined, and so when we start making these tax breaks for the wealthy, we need to remember they are not free. The money has to come from somewhere,” Glanville said.
One particular piece of the state’s budget that will now be much harder to fully fund is crafting a long-term deal to finance road repairs.
When the GOP-led state House failed to produce a complete budget proposal prior to the July 1 statutory deadline, one of the key issues mentioned as a sticking point was a road repair plan. While the House passed a $3.1 billion road repair plan in March, the Democratic-controlled state Senate has declined to take up the proposal.
  State Rep. Carol Glanville (D-Walker) speaking during an online press conference about the effects of the GOP’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending legislation, July 9, 2025 | Screenshot
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) has held firm that any road repair plan must be part of completing an overall state budget. 
McCann on Wednesday indicated that the money available for a road plan will now be much harder to find as lawmakers face the depletion of federal funds for critical social programs.
“What this legislation from Washington does, is it just really injects more uncertainty and chaos into our long-term outlook and so it may certainly impact the dynamics and the considerations as we look at long-term sustainable road funding,” McCann said.

Glanville concurred, saying the lack of a budget proposal from the House, coupled with the certainty of federal budget cuts, makes a road funding plan much harder to focus on.
“When it comes to the roads plan, it’s hard to say. We keep talking about the choices we have to make,” Glanville said. “At the same time we need to fund our roads, we need to fund education, we need to fund health care, we need to take care of our beautiful tourism industry, our agriculture, all of those things are things that we as a state have, historically put forward as priorities.”
She said the choice they now face is to what extent they can find the money for those priorities when the fact is the state relies on the federal government to provide a major share of funding for things like Medicaid.
According to the state budget office, Medicaid makes up 32% of Michigan’s fiscal year 2025 budget, with nearly three-quarters of that funding coming from the federal government. 
“When that money disappears or is in question, that puts us in a position where it’s very difficult to determine how that funding is going to flow. We have the governor’s proposal, we have the Senate proposal, we have nothing from the House,” Glanville said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8629-1024x627.jpg,,,2025-07-10 14:14:20.902403

Parts of the parking lot, campground areas and boat launch will be closed at various stages of construction, according to a press release from the Canyon County board of commissioners. The public may access alternate day-use parking areas in the park and other camping areas at the East End Campground sites, the press release said. 
The improvements to Snake River park will include updated infrastructure, Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant accessibility, and will “promote user activities” at the park, the release said. The project will mark the first time in more than 30 years the boat ramp area has seen a “major improvement,” according to the release. 
“This boater access spot has been used by local fishing guides, jet boat groups, law enforcement, and the public for decades,” Parks Director Nicki Schwend said in the release. “This project is going to be an upgraded, ADA-accessible design that will help us better meet the needs of all boat user groups. We’re excited for this project and for all the continued improvements happening at Celebration Park.”
The boat ramp and dock area is not expected to close until fall. Alternate boat access can be found at the Swan Falls River Access, Walters Ferry Boat Ramp, Map Rock site, and the Marsing Boat Ramp.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The road leading to the back steps of South Carolina’s Statehouse received a $25.5 million makeover in an effort to bolster pedestrian safety and make the area more appealing to visitors, state officials said Thursday.
Formerly a five-lane road, the four-block stretch of South Main Street now has two car lanes.
The sidewalks were extended, allowing for more seating outside coffee shops and restaurants, and bike lanes were added.
More trees and planters frame the Statehouse from the end of the street, giving it the sort of iconic view that might appear on a post card, said pre-construction manager Travis Jolly.
  The South Carolina Department of Transportation says the green sidewalks denoting bike lanes are a first of their kind in the state. (Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)
“This isn’t just Columbia’s Main Street,” said state Rep. Seth Rose, D-Columbia. “This is the state of South Carolina’s Main Street.”
Cyclists will be able to ride their bikes in green lanes that run alongside the sidewalk, separated from motorists by landscaping and from pedestrians by a row of streetlights.
That design, which keeps bicyclists out of the road and therefore in less danger than usual bike lanes, is a first of its kind in the state, according to the agency.
South Main Street links the University of South Carolina to the Statehouse, making it a busy route for students as well as legislators, their staff and visitors to the Statehouse, said Department of Transportation Director Justin Powell.
The makeover “makes this area even safer for our visitors and our residents here while keeping it beautiful,” Powell said.
The funding came from a combination of state, county, city and federal funds, he said. The Department of Transportation did not provide a breakdown of funding sources.
The transportation department also recently completed work on Harden Street, the main corridor running through Columbia’s Five Points, another popular spot for college students.
That $12 million project similarly reduced lanes for cars from four to two, added landscaped medians to prevent jaywalking and added crosswalks that give pedestrians several more seconds to cross before the lights turn green.

A 2020 Department of Transportation study found that road to be among the most dangerous in South Carolina for cyclists and pedestrians.
That problem, addressed through the improvements, was unacceptable for an iconic part of the state, said Rose, who represents that part of Columbia. Funding for it included an $800,000 earmark in the state budget that he sponsored.
With the new improvements in place, he hopes to be able to send his 14-year-old son to get ice cream without worrying he’ll be hit by a car or see elderly couples window shopping without trouble getting around, he said.

Janet Mills gives her state of the budget address in January 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills has opted to postpone her decisions on 61 bills that the Maine Legislature passed this year until lawmakers reconvene in January. 
Among these bills are proposals to give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine, restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns, add Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to Maine’s learning results, and establish a statewide takeback program for firefighting foam contaminated with forever chemicals, following a spill in Brunswick last summer.  
With the Legislature adjourned between its two-year session and the ten-day window after lawmakers concluded work now passed, Mills can either veto these bills within the first three days of the next session or allow them to become law without her signature after that. 
“The Legislature passed a significant number of bills at the end of session, and the governor takes seriously her Constitutional obligation to thoroughly review all of them and to evaluate their implications on Maine people, Maine businesses, and the Maine economy,” Mills’ press secretary Ben Goodman said in a statement. “In order to meet that responsibility, she will continue to review these bills and gather more information, and she looks forward to acting on them at the beginning of the next legislative session.”
The Legislature also has the option to recall these bills from the governor’s desk, so proposals could still continue to be worked on next year.
Bills that become law after being held would be enacted in the subsequent session, meaning emergency legislation would take effect immediately but regular bills would take effect 90 days after the adjournment of that session. 
The 61 bills being held are in addition to the nearly 400 that the Legislature opted to carry over into next year. While some of those bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. That legislation also includes all of the measures that were left on the appropriations and study tables, which had largely passed the full Legislature but needed to still be funded or staffed.  
Some new bills can also be expected to be introduced next year, though any new measures are limited to budgetary matters, legislation from the governor and proposals considered emergency in nature by the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership.

Multiple courts had blocked the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, which is granted under the 14th Amendment to any infant born on U.S. soil. There is an exception for children born to foreign diplomats. Laplante will stay his ruling for seven days to give the Trump administration time to appeal, according to his written order. Laplante was nominated by former President George W. Bush.The high court in June deemed that lower courts should seek a narrower way to issue orders with wide effect, such as a class action suit. Under the ruling, the Trump administration's executive order could take effect by July 27 in the 28 states that did not initially sue.After the Supreme Court ruling, the American Civil Liberties Union filed the suit on behalf of immigrants whose babies would be affected by the order.However, Laplante narrowed his injunction to focus on the infants as the plaintiffs rather than the parents.“This ruling is a huge victory and will help protect the citizenship of all children born in the United States, as the Constitution intended,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the case. “We are fighting to ensure President Trump doesn’t trample on the citizenship rights of one single child.”",,,,2025-07-10 12:21:48.758724

Article Summary

President Trump’s domestic policy bill contains massive cuts in federal Medicaid spending over the next 10 years.
One analysis predicts $48 billion in spending reductions in Illinois over a decade.
The cuts limit states' ability to raise money through provider taxes to fund their share of Medicaid costs.
The cuts also limit the way states use Medicaid to direct additional payments to hospitals.



SPRINGFIELD — Hospital officials in Illinois say they will have to make some difficult decisions in the next few years that could involve laying off staff, cutting back services and even closing some facilities entirely.

That’s the expected result of federal funding cuts built into the recently passed domestic policy bill that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, a law that will cut federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years.

A.J. Wilhelmi, CEO of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois that the financial pressures will fall heaviest on hospitals that serve rural areas, where a larger share of the population is covered by Medicaid.

“The hospitals in these communities are already on the brink, based on some of the increases in labor, drug and supply costs coming out of COVID, a continuation of claim denials by payers and relatively flat reimbursement rates,” Wilhelmi said. “So, all of that is creating significant pressures. And when you add these Medicaid cuts to an already challenging situation, we know that there are several hospitals that close because of these changes.”

Enrollment, reimbursement reductions

The new law contains provisions that are expected to reduce the number of people enrolled in Medicaid, particularly in states like Illinois that expanded eligibility for the program under the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law commonly known as Obamacare.

Those include work requirements for people who enrolled through the expansion as well as requirements that they verify their continued eligibility for the program twice a year instead of annually.

But the law also includes changes in aspects of the program that most people outside the health care industry never see. Those mechanisms – known as provider taxes and directed payments – affect the way states finance their share of the cost of Medicaid and the way they direct additional payments to certain health care providers such as hospitals.

Like many states, Illinois levies special taxes on certain health care providers, including hospitals. The money those taxes generate is used to draw down additional federal matching funds, then is paid back to the providers in the form of directed payments to increase their overall reimbursement rate and to reward them if they meet certain performance or quality standards.

Currently, IHA estimates the hospital tax generates about $2 billion a year in revenue. This past session, lawmakers passed a bill to increase the assessment in order to fund a 54% increase in hospital payments, subject to federal approval of the state’s plan. But state lawmakers passed that bill before Congress passed Trump’s domestic policy bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Prior to passage of the new federal law, the tax rate states could levy was effectively capped at 6% of a hospital’s net patient revenue. But under the new law, for states like Illinois that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, that cap will gradually be lowered by half a percentage point each year starting in 2028 until it reaches 3.5% in 2032.

In addition, Wilhelmi said, the new law imposes a cap on the directed payments that expansion states like Illinois can send to hospitals so that the total does not exceed the maximum allowed under Medicare – the federal health insurance program for seniors, which has a lower reimbursement rate than Medicaid.

“And that will result in a significant reduction in Medicaid reimbursements for hospitals,” Wilhelmi said. “It means literally hundreds of millions of dollars in less reimbursement to hospitals.”

$48 billion impact over 10 years

According to the nonpartisan health policy research organization KFF, federal Medicaid spending in Illinois is expected to be reduced by about $48 billion over 10 years under  the new legislation. That includes an estimated $6.73 billion in spending cuts in rural parts of the state.

Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has been harshly critical of the new law, and particularly the Medicaid cuts contained in it.

“Donald Trump isn't just cutting health care — he's also closing hospitals in Illinois and across the country with his latest scheme,” Pritzker said in one social media post while the bill was moving through Congress. “Hard-working Illinoisans will spend more time in overcrowded waiting rooms and lose access to life-saving care.”

Wilhelmi, meanwhile, said there is still time before the cuts  begin to take effect, and he is urging state officials to begin work immediately to develop strategies to adapt to the changes.

“I think the state will need to work with stakeholders like IHA and our hospitals, other provider groups, to identify creative options to ensure that the Medicaid program can continue to be that lifeline for vulnerable patients and communities,” he said. “And that will include identifying options to fortify those programs and services, as well as identify working with our congressional delegation on ways to mitigate or further delay these changes.”

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico hospital advocates and officials are still determining the impacts from the federal budget bill recently signed by President Donald Trump, but warn that losses of potentially billions of dollars in federal funds will hurt the whole system. 
The bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the joint federal and state program to help cover medical costs for some people with lower incomes.
Per capita, New Mexico has the largest share of the population on Medicaid in the country, with more than 830,000 people enrolled—approximately 40% of the state—just under half of whom are children.
New Mexico Health Care Authority officials are seeking clarity from federal officials on the rollout of the law, according to agency spokesperson Marina Piña.
https://sourcenm.com/2025/06/23/new-mexico-hospitals-and-patients-face-closure-from-domino-effect-of-potential-medicaid-cuts/
Congress’ 11th-hour proposition creating a $50 billion dollar fund to soften the impact to rural hospitals, for example, might only delay by a few years predicted program cuts or hospital closures in New Mexico, New Mexico Hospital Association CEO Troy Clark told Source NM.
It’s also unclear to what degree New Mexico would qualify for those funds, Clark said, noting more direction will be needed from federal officials. The association, which lobbies on behalf of New Mexico’s hospitals, also is waiting to understand when cuts may go fully into effect.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty all around. I would guess the implementation of the various aspects of the law could really swing things very differently for us,” Clark said.
In 2024, the state enacted a provider tax on hospitals during the legislative session in order to provide further state funds to match federal dollars. The Healthcare Delivery and Access Act has generated approximately $1.5 billion dollars, Clark said, which offered the opportunities to expand hospital services. Under the Republican-backed federal tax and spending bill, New Mexico — like others — will lose that funding.

The uncertainty about the depth of the cuts is preventing hospitals from hiring additional staff for new programs and may result, Clark said, with hospitals cutting staff in intensive care units and labor and delivery services — which require high costs, specialized expertise and may have low volumes in smaller hospitals.
If fully in effect, Clark said the  bill’s impacts will worsen New Mexico’s shortage of providers and widen care gaps.
“It will make things more difficult for us to even maintain the access we have, let alone improve it.” Clark said in an interview with Source NM. “We’re already in an access crisis — we can’t afford to lose one doctor.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Troy-Clark-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-07-10 12:21:48.758724

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)House Bill 805, a bill passed in the North Carolina General Assembly and vetoed by Governor Stein this past week, was originally a bill intended to prevent adults and minors from being sexually exploited online. It passed the state House 113-0. Unfortunately, as the bill made its way through the state Senate, it was amended by Republican members to include provisions that target the rights of transgender people and, in effect, seek to deny their existence.
The amended bill is one of scores of similar proposals across the country that have taken flight in recent months. According to the trans legislative tracker that lists data related to anti-trans legislation, there are currently 946 anti-trans bills in 49 states across the country, with 118 having been passed.
As a licensed clinical social worker who has worked in the mental health field for over the last 13 years, with a special focus on treating and uplifting the LGBTQ+ community, I have been following this and other similar bills in recent months. And as grateful as I have been to be able to provide the space my clients need for support and healing, it has been devastating to see the impacts of anti-trans beliefs and anti-trans legislation on those who identify as transgender and gender non-confirming.
My passion for this work began in 2011 during my job as a Therapeutic Mentor, which was my first position in mental health. I provided one-on-one support to youth, helping them develop valuable life skills as a part of an in-home therapy team. My very first client was an adolescent transgender male who was severely depressed and engaging in self-harm.
The goal of in-home therapy is to treat the family dynamic and create a cohesive and supportive environment for the identified client. The reason my client and his parents were receiving our support was due to his parents’ refusal to accept and affirm his gender identity, leading my client to feel that he was unlovable and unworthy as his true, authentic self. My client coped with this by masking his emotional pain with physical pain and contemplating suicide as an option to end that emotional pain.
That case was, unfortunately, one of thousands of similar cases across the country. A survey of LGBTQ+ young people in North Carolina by the Trevor Noah Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention and crisis intervention for LGBTQ+ youth country-wide, found that 41% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously considered suicide in the past year, including 47% of transgender and non-binary youth.
Recently, I spoke with Niccolo Roditti, the co-director of the LGBTQ+ Youth Center of Durham, to learn more about what the youth here in North Carolina say and feel about the anti-trans legislation across the country. He stated, “They are aware of the anti-LGBTQ+ bills, and it makes them feel not human. It makes them feel their existence only matters if it is at the forefront of a political debate.”
I do not believe that most lawmakers who support these kinds of bills have the intention of harming trans youth or even of simply not caring about their impact. Unfortunately, however, they have allowed themselves to be drawn into a coordinated and cynical national attack on the trans community led by the Trump administration and its right-wing allies that is, at once, premised on a false and simplistic narrative and extremely successful at eliciting the intense fear and bigotry. And their “success” is ultimately rooted in a widespread lack of education and understanding about what it means to be transgender.
As is the case with so many modern policy debates, defenders of trans people and their rights face an uphill battle in seeking to overcome unreasoning fear with science and facts. Our cause does not lend itself as easily to simple mottos and talking points. And so it is that we must continue to educate all Americans.
People must be made aware that gender identity is entirely separate from biological sex due to its many psychological and sociological factors. And they must be informed of what gender dysphoria is and learn that things like fear of rejection, stigma, and internalized homophobia are among the factors that contribute to the “clinically significant distress” necessary in order to receive such a diagnosis.
And the public must also learn about and come to appreciate the crucial need for access to gender affirming care, since it significantly decreases suicidality amongst transgender youth.
During Wake County Senator Terence Everitt’s passionate plea for the Senate to reject the anti-trans amendments and return HB 805 back to its original version, he came as close as anyone has to succinctly summing up the misguided nature of such legislation. “Trans people just want to be left alone,” he said. “That’s all they want.”
If, however, we are to get to the point at which a majority of North Carolinians and their elected leaders grasp this simple truth and reject the hate and misinformation that currently predominate, it’s essential that caring and thinking people redouble their efforts to educate their friends, families and neighbors about these issues and share their lived experiences.
