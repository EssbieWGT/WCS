(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — Planned Parenthood’s leadership has “no plans” to close its two Kentucky locations following a judge’s ruling that the government can block Medicaid funding to the organization for a year. 
Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood’s largest geographic affiliate of health centers that includes Kentucky, told the Lantern Thursday during a sit-down interview in Louisville that the state’s two locations — in Lexington and Louisville — will keep their doors open for now. 
The two centers, which see thousands of Kentuckians every year, will continue offering routine services like mammograms, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing, prenatal and postpartum care and more. 
Congress passed a sweeping budget law over the summer that, among other things, banned Medicaid payments to  clinics and providers that offer abortions even for other health care, such as cancer screenings, and family planning services they provide. A judge blocked the ban briefly, but a U.S. Court of Appeals overruled that decision on Sept. 11.

Planned Parenthood leadership, Gibron said, has been preparing for such news since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, removing the constitutional right to abortion and handing states power to create a patchwork of laws. Kentucky immediately banned abortion in most cases. Since then, all lawsuits and bills filed in challenge of the law have failed. 
“What we have been doing, frankly, ever since the fall of Roe, is contingency planning around these scenarios,” Gibron said while visiting the Louisville Health Center last week. “We anticipated a lot of what is happening.” 
For now, she said, Kentucky Medicaid patients will continue to be served for free through September. Slightly more than half (51%) of Kentucky’s Planned Parenthood patients fall below the poverty line and 36% have Medicaid, according to the organization. 
“Our No. 1  priority is protecting our patients’ access to care, so we are doing everything that we can right now to identify the path forward of how we do that,” Gibron said. 
She is turning to donors, hoping to raise funds to fill the gaps, she said. Patients “may have to pay something in the future; that is yet to be determined what that may be,” she said. 
Meanwhile, she believes that “there is no way” the funding blocks will last only one year. 
“Absolutely, we are going to have to raise more money to mitigate that impact of the Medicaid defund,” Gibron said. “We are resilient and resolved. I am fiercely committed to our work and to our patients.” 
‘Lives are at stake.’ 
Jennifer Allen, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates and a policy expert with the organization, told the Kentucky Lantern that funding cuts will have far-reaching fallout, worsening maternal health, birth outcomes, maternity care deserts and more in a state already plagued by barriers to care and poor outcomes.

“Medicaid was created because we had a shared belief in this country that everybody should have coverage for some basic level of health care, including reproductive health care, and we seem to have lost that,” Allen said. “We know that Medicaid never guaranteed access. It only guaranteed at least a minimal level of coverage for folks who could least afford any access to health care.” 
About 1 in 3 Kentuckians are covered by Medicaid, a federal-state program that also saw cuts in the budget bill passed by Congress this year. 
People who have Medicaid coverage, Allen said, “are the folks who already have the worst health outcomes; already may be the sickest, and that’s just going to get worse.” 
The Kentucky General Assembly, she said, needs to “find a way to assure that patients will still have access to care without cost for the lowest income.” 
“We’ve got to figure out how to assure that we have a basic level of expectation of health as a part of basic human rights, as a part of human decency,” Allen said. “Being able to take care of yourself and your family, take care of your body, should be a basic value for all of us. That’s what we need to see. So, donors are wonderful. We love them. We’re so grateful to them, and they care, like we do, about making sure that patients can come in still and get access to care. But it shouldn’t have to be that way.” 
During the interim between legislative sessions, Kentucky lawmakers  have heard several presentations about federal changes to the Medicaid program and details about the budget bill, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. During the 2026 legislative session lawmakers will be tasked with passing a new two-year state budget, which would need to account for funding shifts set in motion by that law. 
Rachel Brown, the area services director for Planned Parenthood who works in Kentucky and other states, said she’s already looking for ways to cut costs and streamline care. Kentucky’s centers see 4,861 patients every year, according to Planned Parenthood data, and more than 8,000 visit the two facilities annually. 
“We don’t know what patients will do when they lose the ability to use their Medicaid here,” Brown said. “I think that patients will still want to come here if they can. The other thing is: There aren’t places to go. The idea that: ‘Take away people’s ability to come to Planned Parenthood and they’ll just go somewhere else’ is a farce. That is not a real thing.” 
Kentucky has had a well-documented health care workforce shortage for years. Researchers have estimated Kentucky could lose 35 hospitals in the funding fallout from the federal budget bill. 
For now: “I want to say really definitively: We have no plans to close our Louisville or Lexington health centers,” Gibron said. “Can I sit here and tell you that will be the case for the next three years of the Trump administration? I honestly don’t know yet, but I’m going to do everything I can to prevent it, because patients’ lives are at stake, and my plan is to not abandon our patients in the way that lawmakers have.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and now Memphis, Tennessee, have been subject to President Donald Trump’s orders deploying National Guard troops to their streets.
Until his announcement last Monday that he’d send in troops and federal law enforcement agents to Memphis with the support of that state’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee, Trump’s focus had been on Democratic strongholds. 
The White House shelved plans to send the guard to Chicago over the objections of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson, after advisors warned it would draw legal challenges. But that didn’t end speculation that other large Democratic-run cities, such as Philadelphia, could be in line for what Trump calls an effort to “restore law and order.”  
“It’s very important because of the crime that’s going on, not only in Memphis, in many cities,” Trump said in the Oval Office when he signed an order to send forces to Tennessee.
Gov. Josh Shapiro and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, both Democrats, have said they plan to fight back with the tools their respective offices provide if the president turns his attention to the commonwealth. 
“It is my hope that it will not get to that here in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro told reporters Wednesday. “I can tell you that we are preparing aggressively on that front.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Krasner said in a series of town hall meetings around the city that he would prosecute federal officials for civil rights violations and encouraged Philadelphians to record any incidents they witness.
The National Guard is unlike other military services in the United States. It exists under dual sovereignty, meaning it is commanded both by the president and the governors of the states where National Guard units are based.
Governors have the authority to deploy their states’ National Guard on missions anywhere in the country for disaster relief, as Shapiro did last winter when heavy snow stranded people in Erie. Guard units under state control can also support civil law enforcement, as in the National Guard’s ongoing mission at the United States-Mexico border.
“I’ve deployed our Guard to the southern border of the United States. I’ve deployed our guard to Germany, where they’ve trained Ukrainian soldiers in trying to push back on Russian aggression,” Shapiro said. 
In that context, the National Guard is functionally a state militia, according to Beau Tremitiere, an attorney with Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to preserving America’s form of government. 
National Guard troops can also be deployed with a governor’s consent under Title 32 of the United States Code, to carry out a federal government mission as in Tennessee.
Without a state governor’s cooperation, the president can federalize National Guard troops under Title 10, which governs the Armed Forces, but their missions are limited to repelling an invasion, putting down rebellion and enforcing federal law.
“I think that it is dangerous when a commander in chief of the United States tries to usurp the power from the commander in chief of the state, it sets up a conflict,” Shapiro added. “And we’ve seen that conflict play out on the streets of Los Angeles as just an example. We are prepared, should the president of the United States seek to try and commandeer our guard and deploy them on the streets of Philadelphia or anywhere in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

National Guard soldiers have been used to enforce federal laws in the past – notably when Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy used troops to enforce desegregation laws. But Lindsay Cohn, a political scientist who studies civilian-military relations, said it is a seldom-exercised power of the presidency. 
“That means there’s very little jurisprudence around it,” Cohn said. “There isn’t really a clear legal path to sending troops into other states for state-level law enforcement.”
If the Trump administration were to call on Republican governors to send guard soldiers to cities like Chicago or Philadelphia, it would be on a highly-dubious legal footing and would violate core constitutional principles, Tremitiere said.
“One state cannot lawfully invade another,” Tremitiere said. “There might be cases when the president could lawfully federalize the guard, even though it’s a bad and dangerous idea. It’s critically different when you’re talking about one state sending forces into another state and actively policing its streets. That’s never OK.”
The Posse Comitatus Act, which stems from the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, forbids federal troops from enforcing state or local laws.
“For the first time in peacetime, in U.S. history, you had a lot of federal personnel, military personnel, being used to try and just manage civilian affairs,” Tremitiere said, adding Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878 to reinforce the nation’s founding principle that military involvement in civilian government is an inherent threat to liberty.
Under the Insurrection Act, however, the president can temporarily suspend the act. The law’s intent is to allow the federal government to address internal rebellion using the regular Army and National Guard. But critics warn that it’s too vague and leaves too many details to the president’s discretion. 
While the Trump administration has reportedly considered using the Insurrection Act, it’s considered an extraordinary measure, Tremitiere said.
“It’s long been recognized as a red line,” he said. “Either facts on the ground are so awful that we have to resort to this extraordinary remedy, or if the glass is broken short of an actual rebellion, it means that there is a clear abuse of power.”

Trump employed Title 10 to federalize California National Guard troops over Gov. Gavin Newsom’s objection in response to protests over immigration raids in June. A federal judge in San Francisco ruled earlier this month that the deployment was illegal. 
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the civilian police force was able to enforce the law and the use of armed troops to conduct traffic blockades and crowd control violated the Posse Comitatus Act. 
Taken with Trump’s and Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth’s statements they intend to send National Guard troops into other cities, it raises concern the administration was “creating a national police force with the president as its chief,” Breyer’s decision said. The administration is appealing.
In the District of Columbia, Trump initially mobilized the district’s own National Guard in August to respond to what he characterized as a city “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals,” notwithstanding federal Justice Department data showing crime in the city is at a 30-year low. 
Six Republican governors have since agreed to use their Title 32 authority to send their National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Because those troops are technically under state control, the Posse Comitatus Act doesn’t restrict them from law enforcement duties.
In a challenge to Trump’s actions, D.C. leaders have argued the deployment violates the autonomy Congress vested in the city to police itself and determine when to request National Guard aid from other states. They also allege it violates the Posse Comitatus Act because the district’s National Guard reports directly to the president and is always under federal control.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has credited the presence of federal law enforcement — including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI — and their partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department with lowering crime in the city.

At the same time she said the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and National Guard troops “is not working,” citing a break in trust between police and the community. “We know having masked ICE agents in the community has not worked, and National Guards from other states has not been an efficient use of those resources,” she said.
Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has endorsed Trump’s suggestion to use the national guard to combat crime in New Orleans, although he has not asked Trump to do it or used his own authority to mobilize the state’s guard.
If the Trump administration were to employ the same tactic in states with Democratic governors, like Pennsylvania, they would have a right to challenge it directly in the U.S. Supreme Court, Jane Bentrott, also an attorney with the Protect Democracy Project, said.
But Tremitiere said Illinois Governor Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Johnson were effective by standing firmly by their convictions that sending troops is unnecessary, unlawful and would not be tolerated.
“Their courage created a real political cost,” Tremitiere said. “All signs suggest their bold stance led to the administration backing down on what appeared to be a pretty clear intention to move forward promptly in Chicago.”
Bentrott said Shapiro has shown similar resolve without picking a fight with Trump.
“So far that seems to be working,” she said. “Not drawing fire while still holding firm that he would oppose the National Guard coming in here.”
More conventional political forces may also shape the Trump administration’s plans as the midterm elections draw closer, Cohn, the political scientist, said. 
“The evidence that we have indicates that the public is not extremely comfortable with militarized law enforcement,” she said. “That is something that at least some of his advisors are going to take into account and worry about.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/metroguard-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

Gavin Newsom blasted President Donald Trump for his “relentless, unhinged California obsession” in a Sept. 9 State of the State address.
Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker likened federal immigration enforcement practices to Nazi Germany.
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey called Trump’s threats of immigration raids in Boston a “power grab” and “political theater.”
Here’s Gov. Dan McKee’s sharpest language toward the White House so far: “At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption.”
The governor’s statement came the day after the Trump administration sent shockwaves across Rhode Island by issuing a stop work order on the Revolution Wind project, already 80% complete and set to begin providing power to Rhode Island and Connecticut late next year.
It’s the same measured tone he’s used throughout his four and a half years as governor. A Cumberland mayor before he was elected lieutenant governor in 2014, ascending to the governor’s office in 2021, McKee, 74, has built his brand around “teamwork” — an homage to his time as a youth basketball coach — that features cooperation with municipal and business leaders, some of whom might not identify as Democrats.
Facing low polling numbers  — he’s at the bottom of the heap among state governors —  McKee is now being cast as too weak, too slow and too deferential to Trump by opinion writers, social media spectators and his potential rivals in the 2026 gubernatorial primary. Do their claims have merit?
Not necessarily, said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist and director of the Taubman Institute for American Politics and Policy at Brown University. While McKee’s critics see his lack of verbal attacks against the Trump administration as a sign of weakness, Schiller views it as a strategic move.
“We have a very big bridge to fix,” Schiller said, referring to the demolition and rebuild of the westbound Washington Bridge, which relies on millions of dollars in federal funding. “I think he was worried about putting that money at risk, and in some ways, rightly so, because Trump has shown he goes after people who criticize him.”
Avoiding bombastic language could help keep Rhode Island off Trump’s radar, in turn preserving the critical bridge funding along with other federal support, Schiller said.
“He took the cautious route,” Schiller said of McKee. “I am not sure that he should be criticized for that.”
McKee doesn’t see his approach as cautious at all, though.
“I speak out against Trump all the time,” the governor said in an interview. “My actions show that.”

Actions not words 
McKee points to his comments about slashed federal education funding and the halt to the Revolution Wind project as examples of his verbal condemnation of Trump’s policies. 
More important to McKee are his actions, like ensuring Rhode Island residents of all ages can receive COVID-19 boosters, with insurance coverage, despite more restrictive federal guidelines and educating Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on exactly how much progress Revolution Wind has already achieved. McKee pointed out that his office organized the Monday morning press conference at Quonset Point — less than 72 hours after the Revolution Wind project was put on hold — bringing together labor leaders, Rhode Island’s congressional delegation and local workers to put the spotlight on the economic consequences of Trump’s actions.
“I’ve made it very clear to everybody that wants to listen, this is a very direct hit on our economy, a direct hit on people’s pocketbooks,” McKee said. “I consider that strong language.”
McKee insisted he heard “no difference” between his responses to the federal administration and the words used by Newsom, Healey and Pritzker.










I speak out against Trump all the time. My actions show that.


– Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee


But it’s not fair to compare McKee to more outspoken Democratic governors. Some states have more to lose under federal actions, and some leaders have more to gain by publicly bashing Trump, said Adam Myers, an associate professor at political science at Providence College.
“Rhode Island is a very small state,” Myers said. “McKee doesn’t have the same political platform that some of these other governors do. And my sense is that he doesn’t have national political aspirations.”
Myers observed McKee turning up the temperature “a little bit” after work on the Revolution Wind stopped, which makes sense given the stakes for state jobs, energy prices and environmental mandates.
“This is something that has major economic ramifications and energy ramifications for Rhode Island,” Myers said. “It’s not just a garden variety culture war.”
Versus, for example, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s written warning to McKee to reverse the state’s “sanctuary” immigration policies. McKee never responded to Bondi’s letter.
“It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to alienate the Trump administration at this point,” Myers said. “The ball is in the federal administration’s court. Exactly what leverage does Rhode Island have?”
Yet trying to keep a vindictive national leader happy might sour some Rhode Island voters on McKee in next year’s gubernatorial race, especially if they have the choice of a candidate with more vocal denouncement of Trump.
An eye on 2026
Public polling suggests six in 10 Rhode Island voters don’t approve of Trump or his administration’s actions; nearly two-thirds of 2024 voters think the country is facing a constitutional crisis, including 27% of Republicans, according to a June survey from the Pell Center at Salve Regina University.
“Democrats are hungry to make a statement to do something, because they’re so distressed about Trump,” Schiller said. “There’s no question, Trump will be the No. 1 issue in the 2026 elections, along with the economy.”
McKee’s known and potential election rivals are already trying to distinguish themselves as more ready and able to take on Trump.

Helena Buonnano Foulkes, 61, who became the second official candidate to declare her intent to run in the 2026 gubernatorial primary, took clear aim at Trump in her campaign kickoff speech.
“Here’s my message to Donald Trump: We will not tolerate your reckless agenda,” said Foulkes, eliciting the loudest, most raucous set of audience cheers of the Sept. 9 event.
In a one-on-one interview the same day, Foulkes criticized McKee’s public stance — or lack of — on federal actions.
“When I look at the Democratic governors, I don’t think Gov. Dan McKee has been at all on the front lines,” Foulkes said. “My biggest criticism is that he is not planning ahead for Rhode Islanders.”










It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to alienate the Trump administration at this point.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who is term-limited, has not confirmed his intent to challenge McKee in the September gubernatorial primary. But he hasn’t ruled it out either.

Neronha, 61, used his platform as the state’s top prosecutor to go hard against Trump, in the courts — part of 34 multi-state lawsuits as of Sept. 4 — and in the public eye.
Despite Schiller’s suggestion that the president might punish those who attack him, Neronha said he has never hesitated or held back — in legal complaints, or verbal rebukes.
“I think you have to stand up to bullies,” Neronha said. 
Already at odds with McKee for years for a series of perceived offenses by both sides, Neronha called McKee’s response to the Trump administration “a little anemic.” 
“The governor may think, you don’t want to poke the bear, but the bear is coming for you,” Neronha said. “You can’t reason with a bear that’s as hungry as Donald Trump.”
McKee brushed off the criticisms by Foulkes and Neronha as “politics as usual.”
“You’ve got a candidate and a potential candidate for my job,” he said.  “I am not surprised.”
That answer might not fly with voters as the campaign heats up. 
“Someone like Foulkes who is not in office has the advantage of riding the wave,” Schiller said. “If McKee was smart, he’ll match her energy as much as he can.”
Labor love 
And while McKee struggles to climb out from persistently low approval ratings — 25% to 29% of voters think he’s doing a good job, according to recent polls — he’s still got the backing of one of the most important influential groups in Rhode Island politics: labor. Union organizers, including Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, stood shoulder to shoulder with McKee during the Aug. 25 press conference at Quonset Point to address the labor impact of the Revolution Wind project.
“I think he came out pretty vociferously on the offshore wind stuff,” Crowley said of McKee. “I didn’t see any lack of vigor.”
The AFL-CIO endorsed McKee in the four-way 2022 Democratic gubernatorial primary, which also featured Foulkes. The organization has not decided who it will support in the 2026 gubernatorial race — it’s too early, Crowley said. 
Labor organizers are looking closely at the fate of Rhode Island’s only major offshore wind project — and who leads the charge.
“Officials at nearly every level of government are saying the right things, but the real question is, ‘what do we do next?” Crowley said. “We just want the jobs back, and we want the project back up and running.”

The line will run 8.5 miles from northern Jackson County through southern Madison County. (Photo by Whitney McKnight/The Edge)RICHMOND — A judge has granted a protective order to an electric utility that sought to prevent the public from seeing a trove of documents requested for review by Berea College. 
Madison Circuit Judge Kristin Clouse heard arguments from the two sides last week before deciding that the Winchester-based East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC) should have the right to protect information about the locations of certain substations and transmission lines, their capacities, the annual load on the substation currently serving the Big Hill region, and other details about how the substation fits into the power grid. 
Clouse did not grant protection for other questions such as what steps the utility is taking to protect the view shed at the college’s Windswept property and whether and when there will be an environmental assessment pursuant to federal law.
The documents had been requested by the college in a discovery motion as the two entities battle over whether EKPC has the right to take about a mile of the college’s forest land to build the 8.5 mile long transmission line. The power co-op  filed a condemnation suit against the college earlier this year.
The college fears that the line will mar the Pinnacles’ viewshed, among other concerns. The Pinnacles is a popular destination for hikers who can traverse a network of trails in the Berea College Forest. 
The college’s legal team has said the ultimate goal is for EKPC to demonstrate conclusively that the transmission line is necessary. The 69 kilovolt Big Hill Line does not meet the state Public Service Commission’s threshold of 138 kilovolts for EKPC to be required to file for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the PSC.
The utility has maintained throughout that the line is necessary to provide reliable power service to the electric co-op members in the region. 
The judge today also granted permission to Ryan Turner, the lawyer for multiple other parties who own property that will be impacted by the transmission line’s construction, to file a motion that the utility must prove it has demonstrated need before it can claim right of way to his clients’ respective properties. The motion will be held in abeyance until after a ruling comes down in the case between the college and EKPC. 
Clouse instructed EKPC to redraft its motion for a protective order to reflect the pared down number of items she granted. All parties, including Turner, were instructed to return to Clouse’s court on Oct. 16 when she will decide on any further actions. 
Meanwhile, EKPC is expected to share all requested documents with Berea College, as part of the discovery phase of the litigation. Berea College is expected to keep the documents confidential. Clouse agreed with the college that if during the document review, the college finds documents it wishes to make public, or if it is discovered that any of the information has already been made public, she would entertain another motion to remove the protective order on a case by case basis. 
Although the college suggested to Clouse that discovery might extend the time for a hearing until next April, the judge said that was too long for a trial such as this, where the line is already in construction. She recommended a hearing on whether EKPC has the right to take the requested parcel of the college’s forest land, be held no later than this coming January.

In a Sept. 16 letter collectively penned by U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo, Rhode Island’s all-Democratic delegation asked Veterans Affairs Secretary Douglas Collins to explain recent department data that shows the department has lost thousands of employees this year. 
“VA employees are essential to serving our Veterans,” the delegates wrote. “The alarming rate at which employees are leaving VA jeopardizes Veterans’ ability to timely access services and benefits they have earned and will undermine the VA’s ability to meet its mission for many years.”
The delegates cited the July 25 issue of the VA’s workforce dashboard, which they say shows the loss of more than 8,700 employees who worked with veterans in the current fiscal year, including 2,129 registered nurses, 751 physicians, 1,283 medical support assistants, and 1,294 claims examiners. 
The dashboard also shows that the VA’s year-over-year hiring pipeline is down in all categories, with the amount of job postings, applications and new hires lower this year than at the same time last year. The Veterans Health Administration reported 13,403 fewer employees across all categories than it had at the start of this fiscal year.
The letter asks for a facility-by-facility breakdown of employee departures in Rhode Island since Jan. 1, as well as data on canceled or rescheduled appointments tied to staffing shortages, plus a list of current job vacancies. 
The delegates want data for Eagle Square VA Clinic, Eagle Street VA Clinic, Providence VA Medical Center, Middletown VA Clinic, Providence VA Regional Benefit Office, and the Providence Vet Center. They asked for occupational details on each departure such as reasons for leaving the VA, years of employment with the VA, and whether the employee resigned or was terminated.
The letter asks Collins to respond by Sept. 30.
Pete Kasperowicz, Press secretary for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, said in an email Friday that the department would respond directly to the delegation’s letter.
The VA previously announced on Aug. 6 that it was immediately nullifying collective bargaining agreements for VA workers, including those associated with the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United, and the Service Employees International Union. 
The department terminated the contracts to comply with a March 27 executive order from President Donald Trump, which excludes parts of the VA, plus other agencies, from the federal labor management statute that allowed for collective bargaining. In 2024, over 1,900 VA employees who were part of bargaining units spent “more than 750,000 hours of work on taxpayer funded union time — including some who are paid more than $200,000 a year,” according to the VA’s news release.
“With no collective bargaining obligations, those hours can now be used to serve Veterans instead of union bosses,” the release reads.
An estimate of the number of employees affected ranges from 350,000 to 400,000 people. 
Rhode Island’s congressional delegates had a different interpretation. 
“Your recent decision to terminate collective bargaining agreements for VA employees will almost certainly make the problem worse, as approximately 80% of VA employees belonged to a union,” they wrote Collins.

Andy Barr. The three spoke at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)At Fancy Farm this summer, Kentucky Republicans were treated to a Senate primary that looked less like a policy debate and more like a contest over style.
Daniel Cameron, Andy Barr and Nate Morris all arrived ready to prove their loyalty to Donald Trump. The question was not whether they support him, but what version of Trump-alignment they could sell to voters in Mitch McConnell’s backyard.
The contrasts were striking. Barr, the Lexington congressman with more than $6 million on hand in July, leaned on the tried-and-true playbook: signs, T-shirts, handshakes, and relentless retail politics.
Cameron, still recalibrating after his 2023 governor’s race loss, presented himself as more laid-back and approachable, conceding he was not the money leader. Reporters noticed a new ease and humor on the trail. 
Morris, by contrast, rolled in with theater. He climbed out of a garbage truck labeled “Nate’s DC Swamp Cleanup Services,” pledged to “trash McConnell’s legacy,” and reveled in the attention. 
That spectacle underscored Kentucky’s unusual political puzzle. This is not Wyoming in 2022, where Trump’s endorsement of Harriet Hageman turned Liz Cheney’s reelection into a referendum on loyalty and ended her career. Nor is it Alaska in 2022, where Lisa Murkowski, an outspoken Trump critic, survived thanks to incumbency and ranked-choice voting. And it is not South Dakota, where John Thune brushed off Trump’s pressure and cruised to reelection in 2022. 
Kentucky’s primary is different because all three Republicans can credibly claim Trump ties. Cameron was endorsed by him in 2023. Barr has never broken with Trump and emphasizes his competence and conservative record. Morris embodies the “drain the swamp” outsider persona, launching his bid on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast and lashing out at McConnell directly. 
Here lies the rub: Kentuckians like Trump, but they also like McConnell. Trump carried the state by roughly 30 points in 2016, 26 points in 2020, and by an even larger margin in 2024, particularly in rural counties. 
At the same time, McConnell’s long tenure has brought prestige and power that many voters respect. Yet nationally, he and Trump were sometimes at odds. After the 2020 election, McConnell privately called Trump “stupid” and “despicable,” according to book excerpts reported by the Associated Press.

Still, McConnell has faced consistently low approval ratings in recent years. Morning Consult polling in 2023 and 2024 repeatedly ranked him as one of the least popular senators in the country. But those numbers have not stopped Republican primary voters in Kentucky from supporting him every six years for nearly four decades, underscoring his resilience at home. Morris’ team must believe their strategy can tap into that unpopularity — either because internal polling suggests an opening or because they think securing Trump’s endorsement would override traditional loyalties.
That contradiction shapes the candidates’ strategies.

Barr is offering Trump-friendly competence with establishment credibility. His advantage is resources and relationships, but he risks being cast as too conventional.
Cameron is running as Trump-aligned but approachable, presenting himself as a neighborly conservative. His challenge is fundraising; charm only goes so far without money to amplify it.
Morris is wagering everything on confrontation, arguing you cannot be pro-Trump while celebrating McConnell, and dramatizing that stance in the senator’s own state. It is a high-risk, high-reward bet.

So what should Kentucky voters make of this? Trump’s dominance inside the Republican Party is no longer in doubt. What remains unsettled is how candidates interpret that dominance in a state that has also long valued McConnell’s clout. In Wyoming, Trump picked a side and the base followed. In Alaska, institutional loyalty saved an anti-Trump incumbent. In South Dakota, seniority and money blunted Trump’s ire.
Kentucky could offer a new model: a contest among three flavors of Trump-alignment — Barr’s establishment competence, Cameron’s neighborly conservatism and Morris’s anti-establishment disruption — playing out in a state that has voted red in every presidential election since 2000 and still tips its hat to McConnell’s influence. 
But another unanswered question looms: if all three are already devoted Trump loyalists, why would Trump even intervene?
If Barr or Cameron prevails, it will suggest Kentucky Republicans are comfortable straddling both camps, embracing Trump without disowning McConnell. If Morris breaks through, it will show that the only way to prove loyalty to Trump is to reject the old order entirely, even when that order is homegrown.
Either way, this primary is not about whether the GOP belongs to Trump. That question has been settled. What is at stake is who gets to define what being Trump-aligned actually looks like in McConnell’s Kentucky, and whether voters believe those two legacies can still coexist under the same red hat.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-09-22 09:23:19+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,"Philadelphia DA Krasner talks National Guard, ICE, and Trump during series of town halls",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/philadelphia-da-krasner-talks-national-guard-ice-and-trump-during-series-of-town-halls/,Some attendees pushing back on Krasner’s rhetoric and focus.,"Members of the National Guard stationed outside Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)Since being sworn in for a second term, President Donald Trump has deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and more are on their way to Memphis, Tennessee, as part of what he said is an effort to restore law and order.
In recent weeks, Gov. Josh Shapiro has faced questions about how Pennsylvania would respond if the president turned his attention to Philadelphia.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has been outspoken on the issue. His office held three public events last week to provide advice for what citizens should do, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach.
“We are here because all over the city are people who do not want an invasion,” Krasner, a Democrat, said at Tuesday night’s event at Salt & Light Church in southwest Philadelphia.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The events were billed as the “Be the Light and Bring the Light” town halls, taking place on three straight nights in different neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Each event ended with Krasner responding to some of the questions submitted via card by audience members.
Krasner said that Trump’s claims of crime being out of control in several big cities, like Philadelphia, were off base. He said he believes there is a different reason.
“This is entirely and specifically an effort to make it normal to have the military in cities, in my opinion, it is entirely and specifically to legitimize more military action later,” Krasner said at Thursday evening’s event at Mother Bethel AME Church in Society Hill.
He told those in attendance, however, that they are not powerless and what they could do to ensure Trump would “leave Philadelphia alone.”
“Get your phone, get your camera, carry it with you. If there are things that you find inappropriate, disturbing, upsetting, whether it’s ICE activity tomorrow or its National Guard, paramilitary, military invasion later: Get the phones up, get that out on social media,” he said. “The fact is, with a million sets of eyes, there’s a whole lot of stuff some people would like to do that’s not gonna get done. And if what they do is a crime, let me see it.”
Krasner said his office would be able to determine if the activity by those in law enforcement from those videos is legal or not legal and would respond appropriately and prosecute them.
He said he believes that public pushback can deter Trump from deciding to send the National Guard to cities like Philadelphia. He cited the president’s recent threat to deploy the guard to Chicago, but ultimately decided against it.

Kate Shaw, a constitutional law scholar and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, joined Krasner for the fireside chat on Tuesday.
Shaw cited the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 as proof that the president does not have the authority to deploy the National Guard domestically. She also noted that a federal judge in California ruled that Trump’s decision to send the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests violated federal law.
“But the bottom line is, it says you can’t send the military in to do civilian peacekeeping,” Krasner said. “The military is for wars. The military is for the enemy. The military is not for us. That’s not what it is, and that has been the law since the Civil War era.”
Philadelphia City Councilmember Jamie Gauthier was the only member of the council to deliver remarks at any of the three events.
“President Trump is trampling over the Constitution and invading cities under the pretext of safety,” Gauthier said. “But tanks rolling down 52nd Street don’t make us safe.”
“Real safety comes from trust between the community and law enforcement,” she added. “It comes from neighbors looking out for each other and from police officers rooted in their communities who are trained as guardians, not to hunt down and kill the enemy.”
Danielle Shaw’s 23-year old daughter was shot and killed in Philadelphia in 2018. She said that she doesn’t believe sending in the National Guard would help combat crime in the city.
“We don’t need the National Guard,” Shaw said. “We need our community. We need our grassroots groups. We need our police department. We need our police department, we need our detectives, we need our lawyers, we don’t need the National Guard.”
Pushback from attendees
Krasner was direct in his criticism of Trump over the three days. During that time, he referred to the president as a wanna-be dictator, a racist, evil, and someone who would like to be king.
“Is the question, will the Pennsylvania legislature and its MAGA members be stupid? Because the answer is, “Yeah,” Krasner said. “I mean, fascist gonna be fascist.”
“These people don’t believe in equality at all. They don’t believe in racial equality. They don’t believe in gender equality. They’re absolutely just as hateful toward women as they are on the issue of race, ” Krasner added. “These are people who agree with Adolf Hitler when he said that equality is a quote ‘degenerate notion,’ unquote.”
Frank Scales, who lives in South Philadelphia, rose to his feet to push back on Krasner’s comments and stated that the district attorney was demonizing Republicans and Trump, and that rhetoric led to the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The motives of Kirk’s alleged shooter remain unclear, although NBC News reported on Saturday that so far “there is no evidence connecting the suspect with any left-wing groups,” and that “every indication so far is that this was one guy who did one really bad thing because he found Kirk’s ideology personally offensive.”
The Associated Press reports he may have been “radicalized” online.
“There is free speech and then there is an effort to stop free speech and what is happening here is the usual right wing effort to silence people who are trying to organize to preserve civil rights,” Krasner responded. “I think the death of Charlie Kirk was awful. I will never justify the murder of another human being.”
Scales left during the second panel discussion and spoke with media members, outside of the church. He said he didn’t plan to challenge Krasner, but called the event a “publicity stunt” when he realized that audience members couldn’t directly ask questions.
Following the event, Krasner told reporters that the use of the word fascist and comparisons to Hilter were “100% necessary” in a time like this, noting his family’s history of military service during World War II.
“It is absolutely necessary to recognize the times we are in to not be appeasers, to not stand by, to not let people take over everything that I believe in and that the city believes in,” Krasner said. “We believe in equality. We believe in freedom. We believe in safety. They don’t believe in any of those things at all. Other people may want to say that Mr. Hitler has a nice mustache. I don’t think so.”
Scales said he supports the National Guard being deployed to Philadelphia, noting that the police department is currently short of the amount of officers they need to have.
“We need dialogue,” Scales said. “So, if Krasner disagrees with Trump, he should say that in good faith, not demonize and call him a fascist. He’s pulling the wool over people’s eyes.”
He is also a founder of Surge Philly, a group that says its mission is to take back Philadelphia by “exposing liberal bias, gut-punching big government, and unleashing free markets.”
In the final moments of Thursday evening’s event, another attendee voiced her displeasure with Krasner.
Judy Robinson said that prevention was key for combating crime in the city.
“I’m in the 22nd District where murder and mayhem is out of control,” she said.
Robinson said that children “are being given guns like crack,” and that she isn’t worried about the National Guard or Donald Trump, but is instead concerned about what can be done to combat crime in her local community. She said she wants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to help address the matter.

ICE also on the minds of Philadelphians
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations was also a topic brought up on several occasions throughout the three-day stretch, with it being a more prominent focus at the event at the Grace Baptist Church of Germantown last Wednesday evening.
“We are specifically protected from federal officials trying to force local officials to enforce their law,” Krasner said. “Frankly, I’d much rather be catching people for homicide than running around catching hardworking kitchen workers who are undocumented.”

“So that I’m clear with you, if somebody comes here and they murder two people, and there’s an interest in deporting them, I’m fine with that, after they finish their sentence. That’s ok with me,” Krasner said. “I am, personally, very much against going after people who are hardworking, who are supporting their families, who are fundamentally law abiding.”
Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal was on hand to explain what her office does, while also fielding a few questions.
“The sheriff’s office does not cooperate with ICE,” she said.
Bilal explained that ICE has an agreement with her office that, among other things, says the agency has to have a valid warrant and cannot come inside the courthouse to arrest anyone.
On the final night, Krasner said the turnout over the three nights had shown him that similar meetings should be held in different parts of the city in the future.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nationalguard-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)There are 169 new affordable homes coming to the greater Richmond area, developers and officials announced last week, following various state and local awards. A recent $1.2 million investment from PlanRVA and the Partnership for Housing Affordability are supporting nine projects — both homes and apartments — that residents who earn 30% to 80% of the area median income can move into. 
Area median income in RIchmond, for example, equals a household salary of about $63,000. This means that people living on nearly $19,000 to about $50,000 per year could qualify as tenants of the new residences in Richmond. Goochland County and Hanover County both have an AMI of about $118,000 while Henrico’s is about $84,000, Chesterfield’s is $101,000, and Powhatan’s is $110,000. 
The funds stemmed from Virginia Housing and were disbursed to organizations like project:HOMES, the Maggie Walker Land Trust, Commonwealth Catholic Charities and various local chapters of Habitat for Humanity throughout Richmond and surrounding counties. 
One of the larger developments is an 83-unit senior citizen apartment complex on Bainbridge Street in Richmond’s Swansboro neighborhood. Matt Morgan with project:HOMES said the location was ideal because it’s near bus stops and presented an opportunity to create infill development on what was once an abandoned building. 
Where a parapet-topped building featuring some apartments with balconies now rises once stood a derelict train servicing station and coal-dumping facility. The crumbling-brick and foliage-covered structure was razed to make way for the new residential space, but part of the building has been preserved and will be the community center – open both to the building’s tenants and neighbors in the area.

While 169 units is relatively small compared to the hundreds of thousands living in the region, it’s169 more individuals or families who will be able to be sheltered as the state and various organizations work to open up more pathways to affordable housing.
Around 30% of residents in Richmond and surrounding counties are cost-burdened, meaning they spend 30% or more of their income on housing, while about 13% of area residents are more severely burdened,  spending 50% or more of their income on housing. 
In Richmond, several neighborhoods have seen new housing construction in recent years, but much of that has been market-rate. The new projects coming online through the housing-focused nonprofits means there will be 169 more opportunities for those in need. 
Members of the various nonprofits joined The Mercury for a tour of the Bainbridge Street development recently to discuss bolstering partnerships with each other and ways state and local governments can keep supporting their work. 
Morgan said that interest rates jumped when project:HOMES was beginning work on the apartments. But when Richmond released a performance grant, it absorbed the interest rate. 
“That meant dollars and cents to the project, so that actually saved this deal,” he said. 
As Richmond is undergoing a local code refresh, PHA director Jovan Burton emphasized how that can help developers create more infill and more dense development in areas. 
An often hyper-local issue, some state lawmakers have worked to help support localities that are trying to address affordability issues. It’s not always easy, however, when tensions between local and state governments emerge. 
A Dillon Rule state, local governments have authority over things like local land use and zoning decisions. State lawmakers have worked on policies that can create flexibility for localities or instances where the state could step in. The ideas don’t always get across the finish line.
But some proposals have passed and been implemented. Now-Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond passed a bill while in the Virginia General Assembly to encourage infill development. More recently a proposal to allow faith-based organizations to build housing on land they already own has been mirrored in a federal proposal. Both have yet to pass, but could prove helpful if they do. 
“It would always be great to have more resources at the state level to support housing, to pair and leverage local dollars,” Burton said.

(Photos by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Workforce development and education leaders said during a Friday summit that Virginia needs to shake things up to continue meeting the surging health care workforce demand across the commonwealth, while also making it easier for educational institutions to offer programs that diverge from the traditional college preparation route. 
According to a study by George Mason University’s Center for Health Workforce, Virginia needs more than 17,000 registered nurses and 10,000 medical and human services managers.
Kathleen deLaski, the author of “Who Needs College Anymore?” recommended the “step-ladder” approach to higher education as a method to consider moving into the future during Claude Moore’s annual health care workforce summit in Richmond.
“We need a step ladder approach to college,” deLaski said. “Rather than being afraid or concerned that they’re going to go out of business if they add products or services besides four-year degrees or two-year degrees, (colleges) should embrace the array of offerings that they could be providing for all. Not just the elite or the middle class, but all types of learners.”
deLaski said she did not write her book to discourage people from going to college, but rather to serve as a “wake-up call” for higher education, noting that 60% of Americans do not complete college. 
She noted that the country’s policy system favors funding four-year institutions over short-term and workforce development programs.
However, recent federal reform efforts are expanding Pell Grants to workforce training programs, changes that could begin as early as next summer. Another reform measure for colleges and universities: the government will verify whether graduates are actually earning a decent income afterward. The U.S. Department of Education extended the reporting deadline to Sept. 30. 
Panelists, including Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera, Virginia Community College System Chancellor David Doré, and Lesa Hanlin, executive director of strategic initiatives and corporate relations at the University of Virginia, discussed some of the barriers and possible solutions, including challenging what has become the norm in education.

Guidera said one way Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration proposed a new method was successfully encouraging the General Assembly to back and fund the establishment of the laboratory schools, which are developed and operated in partnership with colleges and universities and designed to offer students tuition-free specialized instruction for high-demand careers like teaching, computer science and technology. Legislation to establish lab schools in Virginia first passed in 2012 under former Gov. Bob McDonnell. 
“Lab schools are basically what people are doing every single day, which is connecting the dots, bringing people together saying ‘how can we invest in people so they are ready for the jobs in healthcare,” Guidera said, adding that she hopes funding will continue with the next administration.
“Lab schools, apprenticeships, internships, partnerships — this is what’s critical to get over the inertia of ‘keep doing education’ and saying what we’ve always been doing because it’s not working what we have been doing, and this is the future,” Guidera added. 
Former Del. Kathy Bryon, who was one of the panelists, carried a few pieces of successful legislation around workforce development including one to create the state’s FastForward, a short-term career credential training program, and another measure that led to the development of the Department of Workforce Development and Advancement, or Virginia Works, to centralize oversight of workforce development programs and data systems.
Byron, now a deputy commissioner with Virginia Works, said employers are telling the team that a college degree by itself is no longer the right indicator of readiness. 
“What matters is the skills they bring, the competences they bring, the experiences that they bring on the job,” Byron said.
Panelists also shared a consistent theme of changing the narrative to ensure all Virginians — from students to parents, veterans, to new career seekers — understand that entities, including the Virginia Community College System, are here to support them.
The event attracted more than 100 stakeholders from school systems and businesses around Virginia.

Bill Hazel, CEO of Claude Moore Opportunities and former Virginia Secretary of Health, said in a statement that the event was an “amazing gathering” of people focused on creating “family sustaining career opportunities” while meeting the state’s health care needs.
“There are rewarding and critically needed positions waiting to be filled throughout the healthcare system, but too often people don’t know how to get the training and credentials they need, or face barriers that keep them out of the healthcare workforce,” Hazel said. “When we invest in flexible, accessible career pathways in healthcare, we lift more Virginians into the middle class and help our fellow Virginians live healthier lives.”

(Photo by Janie Segui Rodriguez/Stop the Wait)The drove of parents in yellow T-shirts who trooped up the stairs in Providence’s City Hall to the City Council chambers on July 24 hoped they were heading for the grand finale of months of advocacy for a desirable new school. Their T-shirts were emblazoned with Stop the Wait, a nonprofit that helps parents understand their rights and champions public school options so children from low-income families aren’t trapped in schools they don’t like. 
That night the City Council was ready to vote on a proposal to lease the vacant Carl Lauro Elementary School building on Kenyon Street to Excel Academy for 35 years. The deal included $80 million for a full renovation on Excel’s dime, as well as lush ancillary benefits to Providence’s district schools, families, the city, and the neighborhood surrounding an abandoned eyesore residents had put up with for two years. The cost to the city for maintenance and security of the vacant school: $300,000 a year.
Stop the Wait registered each on-the-ground advocate. CEO Janie Sequi Roderiquez said 419 parents made thousands of phone calls and knocked on thousands of doors to solicit support. 
While the parents and nonprofit advocates worked, City Council President Rachel Miller negotiated the lease with Mayor Brett Smiley and Excel staff. A July 17 council newsletter outlined the details of the deal that had been carefully vetted with public meetings and a feasibility study. 
But the parents knew there could be trouble. Because 24 hours earlier, Miller did a whiplash 180 and insisted the council vote against it. 
Despite a new sound system, the council chamber’s acoustics are so bad, participants strain to hear and be heard. 
When the vote took place, a triumphal whoop went up. Some families joined the clapping and hugging to celebrate what they assumed was a victory for their kids. 
It was not. 
The lease died on an 8-4 vote. The applause actually originated with Providence Public School District (PPSD) teachers, dressed in familiar blue T-shirts, who show up at education-related public meetings. As translations and corrections circulated, parents were shocked to learn the teachers weren’t with them after all. A dark sense of betrayal replaced their initial confusion. Tears broke out.

The parents learned the hard way that the lease had little to do with serving the public or shepherding scarce resources. It was about protecting union jobs by vilifying charters with sentiments verging on hatred. Charters are public schools — publicly accountable, publicly supported, though underfunded compared with district schools — that are not necessarily unionized. 
Political dignitaries conduct silly “listening tours” but won’t hear the hard data screaming from the charter waiting lists where thousands of families languish. Parents of all economic classes want public charter seats because they’d prefer diverse, effective, taxpayer-funded public schools. Excel will open eventually as soon as it finds a private building that will come off the city’s tax rolls, unlike the disused Carl Lauro building.
You’d think the council would be salivating at the $80 million. Last November, the city lost a $15 million lawsuit brought by the Department of Education for underfunding what the state deemed its share of the per pupil expenditure. This unbudgeted expense forced the city to ask the General Assembly to let it override the 4% cap on raising the city’s total tax levy, per state law. City residents and businesses were outraged. 










As translations and corrections circulated, parents were shocked to learn the teachers weren’t with them after all. A dark sense of betrayal replaced their initial confusion. Tears broke out.


And lest the taxpayers of greater Rhode Island feel they have no stake in Providence school problems, actually they pay almost half of Providence’s per pupil expenditure and their taxes reimburse 80% of school capital expenditures. The lack of a Lauro School lease is now a state problem. 
In a July 23 council newsletter, Miller stated: “The city council will not hand the keys of a shuttered public school building to a charter school.”
Up until 24 hours earlier, the only organization that didn’t like the deal was the teachers union, a private-sector business which, like all unions, exists to benefit clients and not the public mission those clients are supposed to serve. 
A teacher’s July 21st Facebook post reads: “We did it guys! It didnt (sic) pass and public school teachers showed up. Excellent Video. We must remain steadfast! … Bravo to ALL who have supported PUBLIC schools that serve ALL students (unlike charter schools)” – which is not only not true, but illegal by state law.
The “excellent video” shows Councilor Miguel Sanchez and school board member Cory Jones malign charters in a stream of misinformation and flat-out lies that would take an entire column to rebut. 
At the July 17 ordinance meeting, Sanchez also said, “I’d rather have an empty building there, that we’re paying $300,00 for (per year), than to give it over to a charter school system.” 
At the same meeting, Councilor Justin Rois said, “We’re giving a few lifeboats away and keeping students in PPSD on a sinking ship…” Councilor, did you hear yourself? PPSD was a sinking ship in the early 1990s when I joined the Providence School Board. Without serious structural changes, the schools have no hope of getting better and never did.
To use Rois’ description of the schools, the obvious thing to do would be to provide as many lifeboats as we possibly can until the sinking ship either sinks or makes itself attractive enough to compete with the desirable schools the council so denigrates.
So, here you are, Rhode Island. These are your tax dollars at work.
Bring on the lifeboats.

A new survey of more than 700 Hampton Roads residents found that a majority expect major risks from flooding in the decades to come.
But people’s perceptions of flood risk varied widely depending on where they live and their demographic background, suggesting potential disparities in how the impacts of flooding are felt across the seven cities.
Questions about flooding were part of Old Dominion University’s annual Life in Hampton Roads survey, which aims to gain insight into residents’ opinions on topics including politics, health, education and the economy. The 2025 survey was conducted online, instead of via phone as in previous years.
Tancy Vandecar-Burdin, director of ODU’s Social Science Research Center, said the answers show flooding is on most residents’ minds.
“I think residents’ perceptions are reflecting reality,” she said. They are “recognizing the risk of flooding to their homes and neighborhoods and to their city as a whole.”
About 72% of respondents believed there is some or a high risk of severe flooding from sea level rise in their city over the next 30 years. Residents of Norfolk were the most likely to report risk, followed closely by Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
The proportion dropped off as the questions got more granular: About 53% of people reported risk in their specific neighborhood, and 43% to their individual property.

The ODU survey has frequently included questions about flooding and climate change, but the specific questions vary each year.
This year, officials were particularly interested in learning about the impacts of flooding on housing, reflecting growing concerns about affordable housing.
Flooding is an exacerbating factor, Vandecar-Burdin said. As flooding gets more severe, it could make some places unlivable, reducing the housing stock while making lower-risk areas less affordable.
Some Hampton Roads residents already believe the issue is impacting their property’s worth.
Almost a third of respondents said they believe flood risk has somewhat or greatly affected their area’s property values – especially in Norfolk, where the percentage was nearly half.
Black residents and those with lower household incomes were significantly more likely to report decreased property values.
Vandecar-Burdin said that’s in line with other research that shows marginalized communities are more vulnerable to flooding.
“Folks that have higher socioeconomic status have greater capacity and resources, which allow them to be more selective about where they buy or rent their home,” she said.

But increasing perceptions of flood risk don’t seem to be drastically changing people’s behavior, she said.
Only about a quarter of respondents said flood risk information influenced decisions about their current housing. And rates of buying flood insurance have barely budged since the surveys began 15 years ago.
Vandecar-Burdin said she hopes the findings will encourage local leaders to help provide residents with information on how to assess and mitigate their risk.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As the first fall leaves drifted to the ground in Damascus Town Park on a recent warm September day, Mayor Katie Lamb spoke to an audience just off the Virginia Creeper Trail trailhead. One year ago, Laurel Creek began to rise and quickly flooded downtown — washing away homes and battering businesses.
“Helene came in with a vengeance, and she may have damaged and destroyed our structures, but she did not shatter our Appalachian mountain virtues or our love for our town,” Lamb said.

Reportedly, 140 structures in Damascus were damaged or destroyed – bringing an estimated $12 million in damages to residential properties, businesses and public facilities. The state endured an estimated $4 billion in damage and hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris were strewn across the region. Three people in Virginia died as a result of the storm, as well as over 250 people in other states.
In Damascus, home to 747 residents, the floodwaters washed out bridges and trestles, sending debris slamming into each  bridge until it gave way and the surging currents flowed down to the next. The Laurel Creek water gauge read 18 feet before it was washed away. 
As the mayor spoke 12 months after the devastating storm, crews could be heard jackhammering away the former bridge on Orchard Hill Road. The washed out bridge still rests on the banks, evidence of the sheer force of the flood waters that came through.

While people were rushing to save their homes and lives, the livelihood of many in the region was being washed away farther east. 
Multiple popular hiking and biking trails, such as the Appalachian Trail, converge near Damascus. Many of the town businesses are catered to visitors who wish to bike the 34-mile gravel trail that stretches from Abingdon to White Top along old train routes. The most popular portion is from White Top to Damascus, as it is mostly downhill and shaded in trees. Helene’s flooding almost wiped that portion off the map completely.

“We lost so much the day that the trail flooded. October’s always the busiest month, and that’s how we get through the winter by having a huge October,” said Michael Wright, owner of Adventure Damascus Bicycles and another business.
Developers are currently bidding on rebuilding the 17-mile portion of the trail that was most frequented by bikers of all ages. There is a tentative timeline of it reopening by October 2026. The project is estimated to cost $200-300 million.
Seated in the office of one of his stores, Wright said business is down about 75% for his bicycle rental and shuttle storefront. His employees took calls in the background, explaining to customers that the popular part of the trail is going to be closed for at least another year. Hundreds of bikes are lined up in the back of the building, waiting to be taken out. 
Wright’s other business, which outfits Appalachian Trail hikers, is down about 30% this year despite the trail being fully open. About 400 miles of the trail was closed across multiple states immediately after the storm.

He had never seen flooding like that in all his years living in the area. In all his years living in the area, Wright said he’s never seen flooding like Helene’s. His bicycle rental store along Laurel Creek had multiple inches of water in it. He had to lay off most of his employees in the wake of the storm, but has been able to hire back some of them, mostly part-time workers. 
“So, you know, everything’s just gone, in an instant. We didn’t know what to do, where to go, but we just started cleaning up,” Wright said.
Two homes just across the trail that runs alongside his store were washed away in the flood and have already been replaced. When Wright posted on Facebook that the bike shop doors were open again months after the flood, a couple that had been coming to Damascus for years drove all the way from Alabama to give them business and support them through tough times.
“I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years, but over the years, people come to town and they love coming to town. I love the place so much,” Wright said. “I didn’t realize as many people had the same feeling that I did. But it makes perfect sense. That’s why they keep coming back.”
The town has been working hard to leverage other activities and the second half of the Creeper Trail to show visitors that they are still open for business. 
“We’re nervous about this winter for sure. We have a lot of hope now that the trail will be open next year,” Wright said.
Down the main drag of town, Blue Blaze is another bike rental shop that has had to adjust to operating with only a portion of the Creeper Trail open. Owner Rich DeArmond, at his front desk  that still bears the water marks of Helene’s flooding, explained that he has invested in more e-bikes to help people bike the Damascus to Abingdon portion of the trail, which is not as downhill and more of a challenge for some riders. He describes this shift as a new beginning.

The town parks and recreation department has been emphasizing other draws to town such as trout fishing, hiking trails, and the overall peacefulness of the small community nestled in the middle of the mountains. Most of the businesses that were flooded are back open and looking for visitors to come in the door.
“We could either sit around and be sad, or we could do something about it, and so we decided to do everything we could to bring Damascus back,” Julie Kroll, the town recreation director, said.
Right next to where the bridge over Laurel Creek was washed out, Jennifer Walker had owned a rental home for six years. At the time of the storm she had tenants staying there who, fortunately, evacuated in time as the water quickly rose and eventually destroyed the house.
Walker and her family live just across the North Carolina border, a state that was lashed most severely by Helene. Their home was hit with a powerful mudslide that knocked part of the house off the foundation and ripped portions off to be carried away. They did not live in a floodplain and did not have flood insurance so they’ve had to rely on a small award from FEMA and slowly put what they can back into its reconstruction.
“In the back of our heads, we’re like, this is horrible, but we have our Damascus house. So we have a place to go … we went up to the top of our mountain, tried 81 times to make a phone call, and I got one call through to my mom. And at the same time, a video came through from the renters, and they said, ‘we’re sorry, it’s bad’,” Walker said.
While the home that held many memories of wintering in Damascus for them, Walker is eager for her new venture to come to life. In the spirit of the Creeper Trail, she has purchased two train cabooses that will be made into a hotel. She hopes it will be a fun experience for people who come through to ride the trail that passes right next to the property.
“You know, it’s just one of those things where you’re like, I’m glad that this town has bounced back.  It’s cool. I mean, it’s just, and I’m not saying that because I have a place here, but it is a really special little town,” Walker said.
Washington County residents were awarded $2.4 million in individual assistance from FEMA; $2.1 million of that was distributed in Damascus. The nonprofit Trails to Recovery has raised $1.7 million in private donations and aided in repairing 83 homes and doing complete rebuilds of eight houses for county residents since the storm.
In April, Gov. Glenn Youngkin accelerated unlocking funds from the $46,670,000 allocated to Virginia by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through disaster recovery grants. A number of disaster loans were made available to southwest Virginians who were in need of assistance to build back their homes and businesses.
With the construction of the trail set to begin in the coming months, there are efforts to have workers stay in town and utilize local businesses for transportation to work sites. Wright said there is a possibility of his shuttle being used – which would help them survive the winter financially. The Old Mill Inn operators said they hope to have some workers stay there.

Lamb became emotional during a tour of local businesses, explaining how hard they’ve worked to bounce back. She said they’ll never know the names of all the volunteers who flocked to the town to help people muck out their homes and rebuild structures. Damascus is hosting an event on Sept. 27, the day the waters rose, to show appreciation for those who helped them. 
The town of Damascus has a population of less than 1,000. But during certain events that all revolve around the trails in the area, thousands of people gather there. When walking downtown now, it could be hard for out of towners to know what devastation was wrought there only a year ago. There are signs of it in the water lines on wood, the erosion of the water fronts, and the ongoing construction. But the spirit of Damascus has not diminished and residents are still welcoming visitors, whom they say are a lifeline of their community’s economy. 
“We’re going to be better than we’ve ever been because we have each other, and we are damn strong,” Lamb said.

(Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)Colleges have an obligation to create a culture that fosters free speech, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during recent comments at the Ohio Department of Higher Education’s Trustees Conference. 
DeWine covered many topics during his nearly 50 minute speech including briefly talking about free speech on campuses, cell phones in college classrooms, and how colleges of education are training future teachers when it comes to teaching students how to read. 
He did not mention Ohio’s new higher education law, Senate Bill 1, that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion, among other things.

“The horrible, horrible, horrible tragedy, Charlie Kirk on a college campus, engaging in free speech, being gunned down,” DeWine said. “I’m talking about the obligation, I think, that colleges have to create a culture … colleges should be a place of ideas.”  
Kirk, a right-wing political activist, was shot and killed last week while he was speaking at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. 
“I’m not really talking about (Kirk’s death), how that could have been prevented or couldn’t have been prevented,” DeWine said. “That’s a security issue.”
Universities, he said, need to create an environment on campus that respects ideas. 
“You might disagree with one of your fellow students, but that’s kind of what college is all about,” DeWine said. “It’s exploring and getting different ideas. … Free speech is important. It’s important everywhere, but it’s also super important, I think, in the village of college campuses.”
Cell phones 
Ohio recently banned cell phones in K-12 schools and DeWine wants college students to put their phones away, too. 
“I suggest you ban them in your classrooms,” he said. “It’s that simple.”
When speaking to reporters afterwards, DeWine said he does not think there should necessarily be a law around cell phones in colleges. 
“I don’t think we’re looking to tell colleges to (ban cell phones),” DeWine said. “That was a strong suggestion. … What we know about these devices is that they pull people away from thinking about what’s going on in that classroom.” 
Reading 
This is the second school year Ohio school districts are required to teach the science of reading, which incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. DeWine has helped champion the science of reading in Ohio by originally putting it in the state’s 2023 budget, which was eventually signed into law.
“Think phonics on steroids,” DeWine said. “Reading, to state the obvious, is essential to success in K-12, it’s essential to your success in college. It’s more importantly, though, essential to your success in life.”
The Ohio Department of Higher Education conducted an audit to show how each educator training program aligns with teaching the science of reading instruction. Under state law, Chancellor Mike Duffey can revoke a college or university’s approval if they fail the audit. 
The audits are completed, and colleges and universities with educator training program will be hearing their results in the coming months, DeWine said. 
“I’ve seen the results,” he said. “Some of them are great, but some of them are not. We still have colleges in the state of Ohio that do not follow the science of reading. That’s a problem.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)LEFT HAND, W. Va. — The residents of Roane County, West Virginia, enjoy living among the rolling mountains and winding, two-lane roads. Situated between Charleston and Parkersburg, two of the state’s largest cities, the rural county is known for its small towns and historic buildings.
That’s how Sherry Husted, the director of the Roane County Public Libraries, described her native community as she worked last week at Geary Public Library in Left Hand, West Virginia. Each of the county’s three library branches has at least three public computers and free internet access, among other services.
These services are essential to residents living in Roane — where less than 32% of the county’s households, businesses and community buildings — have reliable internet connectivity, according to the Federal Communications Commission’s National Broadband Map.
“We love our rural area,” Husted said. “But there’s always the catch. You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.”
Members of the library staff regularly help patrons fill out job applications and build resumes. They also help those who have never used a desktop computer before — many of the county’s residents rely on their cellular devices and spotty mobile service, Husted said. Most residents still use landline phones, she added.
And those with internet access at home are paying a steep price. Husted’s plan with Frontier, which includes fiber internet and a landline, comes to $170 a month.
“If you work from home, you need reliable internet,” she said. “Frontier does the best they can. But this is a very rural area, so the trees and terrain are constantly messing up the internet. And because of the demand on these older lines, your internet may not be reliable enough to host things like meetings or classes.”
Roane County is one of the areas federal officials hoped to support through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, or BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access. The $42.45 billion initiative, created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aimed to close the digital divide — with a focus on rural communities.
The Trump administration’s changes to the program, however, have disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations — including homes, businesses and community buildings — from receiving internet access. And the program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the federal funds toward satellite internet companies, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, that cost less to build but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable.  That means households and businesses that were looking forward to reliable, high-speed internet will no longer get support from the BEAD program.
While some experts were initially skeptical about the program’s goals, every state utilized its allocated funds to develop plans to provide high-speed fiber internet to nearly every home and business in the country, said Christopher Mitchell, the director of the Community Broadband Networks Initiative with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an anti-corporate advocacy group.
Most states are expected to get started on deployment projects in 2026. But the Trump administration’s changes have undermined the major investment for rural areas, Mitchell said.
“I think everyone should care about it — even though most people don’t live in rural America — because when we electrified the entire country, the entire economy grew,” Mitchell said. “We will all benefit from this when everyone has more options to share their knowledge, their gifts and their productivity in the economy.”
Even West Virginia, ranking last in internet connectivity, would have effectively achieved universal broadband under the state’s original proposal, according to an unreleased draft of the state’s plan obtained by The Benton Institute for Broadband and Society, a policy group. West Virginia has about 78% connectivity, the only state with less than 80%.
But under West Virginia’s updated final proposal, submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration earlier this month, tens of thousands of households and businesses will no longer have access to BEAD funding.
West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he is still optimistic about the rollout, telling reporters recently that some of the decrease in coverage was because of inaccurate information. Some areas had just a few homes, or addresses only had a barn on the property, he and an aide said.
“We’ve been trying to target all the available locations that are eligible,” the governor said Sept. 18 at a news conference at the West Virginia State Capitol. “It’s a pretty fulsome application, and so obviously there were some changes made to accommodate some of the responses from the administration. And in a positive way, they’re trying to save money.”
There are other changes: Internet providers  will no longer be required to provide a low-cost service option to residents to address affordability concerns. And under the “technology-neutral” approach, some locations will no longer be receiving fiber internet, which the federal government previously emphasized due to its speed and durability.










You love your rural area, but then access to things is always more limited there.


– Sherry Husted, director of the Roane County Public Libraries


The new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
West Virginia isn’t alone. Under the new rules, thousands of households, businesses and community buildings across the country will be disqualified from the federal government’s push to provide internet access to the areas that need itmost. And those locations that are still eligible for funding may not receive the best service available — or be able to afford it.
West Virginia has one of the country’s worst workforce participation rates. Internet access is key to changing that, said Bill Bissett, chairman of the West Virginia Broadband Enhancement Council.
“We are hopeful that this new proposal will be supported because we need to get started on this development as soon as possible,” Bissett said. “Because the longer we wait, the less people will be connected because of increased costs in deployment and infrastructure.”

Following the required revisions, West Virginia fared well compared with other states, said Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. But Garner said he expects frustration in other states.
“West Virginia, because it did a good job with its restructuring, is still going to have a lot of strong outcomes,” Garner said. “But across the country in some of these other states, I think there’s going to be a lot of frustration with these changes and the way it walked back from what was going to be a very promising outcome.”
BEAD restructuring
In June, the Trump administration revised the rules of the BEAD program in what the U.S. Department of Commerce said was an effort to lessen regulatory burdens, reduce costs and streamline the process.
As of Sept. 18, 41 states had submitted their updated final proposals, according to a database from Connected Nation, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded broadband access.
In December 2022, when the FCC released its updated National Broadband Map, nearly 12 million locations across the country were in need of internet service. Over the years, that number has decreased because of private investments, continued deployment by existing internet providers and additional support from other federal programs.
States originally identified 4.86 million locations that would be eligible for getting internet connectivity through BEAD funds. But that number is projected to fall to 4.19 million locations following revisions initiated by the Trump administration, according to an analysis from Broadband Expanded, a project from the New York Law School.
West Virginia was originally slated to deploy broadband to approximately 110,000 locations. Now, 73,560 of those locations will receive BEAD funding, according to the state’s new proposal. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska and Rhode Island could see more than half of the locations in their state disqualified from the program.
But some of those locations may still be in need of internet, said Garner, of the Benton Institute.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, directed states to remove certain locations from the BEAD program because they’d acquired internet access from another source.
But, in an effort to save taxpayer money, states also had the option to say they were “financially incapable” of serving a location.
“One of the changes the administration made to the BEAD program is that states and the NTIA now have a way to simply say that these locations are just too expensive,” Garner said. “They can say, ‘It is just going to cost too much, so now we’re going to say they’re ineligible.’”
Trump’s broadband program overhaul favors Musk tech, strips low-cost plans

The BEAD program’s new technology-neutral approach poses another challenge. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations. But some argue that other technologies would be cheaper.
This change has opened the door for satellite internet providers, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to receive money from the program. Starlink could be awarded approximately $10 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In West Virginia, Starlink will serve more than 4,100 locations, according to the governor’s office.
“Based on the technology and based on all the evidence we have, some of these technologies — unlicensed fixed wireless especially — are not really a reliable internet service that’s going to meet the needs of a 21st century household,” Garner said.
Rural advocates speak up
In Nebraska, more than half of the counties in the state have signed onto letters to federal officials objecting to the changes, including the disqualification of nearly half the state’s eligible locations.
“It’s very frustrating. We have all these holes in our county, and BEAD was going to bring service to those areas,” Milford County Commissioner Misty Ahmic told the Nebraska Examiner.
Critics in Pennsylvania have said directing funds toward satellite companies is “shortsighted.” Satellite companies Starlink and Project Kuiper, an Amazon subsidiary, were awarded a combined $19.2 million to expand internet access in Pennsylvania.
And in Oklahoma, critics noticed the updated plan would not be using $225 million of the state’s allocated BEAD funds.
The state’s head broadband official said the new proposal would still serve everyone, but critics told the Oklahoma Voice that it would be wrong to send back any federal money while people across the state continue to struggle with internet access.
Originally, states were allowed to use these leftover funds to pay for things other than broadband deployment, such as West Virginia’s plans to improve cellular service and streamline the permitting process for broadband projects. But the federal telecommunications agency has not released guidance on how the leftover funds are to be used under the restructured program.
“There’s a lot of fear right now that NTIA may try to call that money back, which would be a big shame,” Garner said. “That leftover money is the state’s, according to the law. And these ancillary funds would play a huge role to support the BEAD program.”
Affordability also will be a barrier for some households. States are no longer required to provide a low-cost service option for low-income households under the changes. And the federal Affordable Connectivity Program ended last year without additional funding from Congress.
Morrisey said his administration is being aggressive, collaborating with the Trump administration to get internet access to eligible areas.
“I applaud the Trump administration for working with us, but once again, I am not going to do a victory lap until we actually get this all done,” the governor said.
Providing internet to every person in West Virginia was always a lofty goal, said Husted, the Roane County Public Library director.  Other initiatives have promised to connect rural residents over the years, Husted said, and she remains skeptical about this outcome.
“In rural areas, you’re going to need to plan for things, and sometimes that puts us at a disadvantage compared to the cities,” Husted said. “With the internet or with other supplies, sometimes we have to decide what is more important to us.”

The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has sparked a wave of political commentary.
There were the respectful and sincere comments condemning the killing. Former President Barack Obama said, “What happened was a tragedy and … I mourn for him and his family.” And former Vice President Mike Pence said, “I’m heartsick about what happened to him.”
But Kirk’s killing also elicited what many saw as inappropriate comments. MSNBC terminated commentator Matthew Dowd after he said, “Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.” American Airlines grounded pilots accused of celebrating Kirk’s death.
Perhaps the most notable reaction to remarks seen as controversial about the Kirk killing hit ABC comedian Jimmy Kimmel. His network suspended him indefinitely after comments that he made about the alleged shooter in Kirk’s death.
Countless defenders of Kimmel quickly responded to his indefinite suspension as an attack on the First Amendment. MSNBC host Chris Hayes posted the following on X: “This is the most straightforward attack on free speech from state actors I’ve ever seen in my life and it’s not even close.”
But is it?
 
 FCC Chairman Brendan Carr’s statement about how Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks could hurt ABC affiliate stations.


Free speech? It depends
The First Amendment limits government officials from infringing one’s right to free speech and expression.
For example, the government cannot force someone to recite the Pledge of Allegiance or salute the American flag, because the First Amendment, as one Supreme Court justice wrote, “includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.”
And government cannot limit speech that it finds disagreeable while permitting other speech that it favors.
However, the First Amendment does not apply to private employers. With the exception of the 13th Amendment, which generally prohibits slavery, the Constitution applies only to government and those acting on its behalf.
So, as a general rule, employers are free to discipline employees for their speech – even the employees’ speech outside of the workplace. In this way, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham correctly said on X, “Free speech doesn’t prevent you from being fired if you’re stupid and have poor judgment.”
This is why Amy Cooper’s employer, an investment firm, was free to terminate her following her 2020 verbal dispute in New York’s Central Park with a bird-watcher over her unleashed dog. She called the police, falsely claiming that the bird-watcher, a Black man, was threatening her life. The incident, captured on video, went viral and Cooper was fired, with her employer saying, “We do not condone racism of any kind.”
This is also why ABC was able to fire Roseanne Barr from the revival of her show, “Roseanne,” after she posted a tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a Black woman who had been a top aide to President Obama, that many viewed as racist.
But as a scholar of constitutional law, I believe Kimmel’s situation is not as straightforward.

Threat complicates things
Neither Cooper’s employer nor Barr’s employer faced any government pressure to terminate them.
Kimmel’s indefinite suspension followed a vague threat from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr. As complaints about Kimmel’s statement exploded in conservative media, Carr suggested in a podcast interview that Kimmel’s statements could lead to the FCC revoking ABC affiliate stations’ licenses.
“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said.
But the Supreme Court has been crystal clear. Government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.
In a 2024 case, National Rifle Association v. Vullo, a unanimous Supreme Court plainly said that the government’s threat of invoking legal sanctions and other coercion to suppress speech it doesn’t like violates the First Amendment. That principle is so profound and fundamental that it got support from every member of an often bitterly divided court.
A threat to revoke broadcast licenses would almost certainly be seen in a court of law as a government action tantamount to coercion. And Carr’s public comments undoubtedly connect that threat to Kimmel’s disfavored comments.
If the FCC had indeed moved to strip ABC affiliates of their licenses to broadcast because of what Kimmel said, ABC and its parent company, Disney, could have sued the FCC to block the license revocations on First Amendment grounds, citing the NRA v. Vullo case.
But the network seemingly caved to the coercive threat instead of fighting for Kimmel. This is why so many are decrying the Kimmel suspension as an attack on free speech and the First Amendment – even though they might not fully understand the law they’re citing.

(Getty Images)As data center development takes off across the United States and the world, New Hampshire legislators and regulators are weighing what steps their state, and its aging electric grid, should take to prepare.
“For me, it’s worth considering. There may be an opportunity here, but I think there’s also concerns,” said Sen. David Watters, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
Data centers — large, energy-hungry facilities housing computer networks — are rapidly becoming more common nationwide, data center developer Craig McGahey told New Hampshire lawmakers and energy professionals at the 2025 New Hampshire Energy Summit, organized by consulting and lobbying firm Dupont Group on Sept. 15.
The rise of artificial intelligence is the biggest factor contributing to increasing data center demand, McGahey said, citing competition among so-called “hyperscalers” — expansive cloud computing companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and others. 
“As this race for AI dominance continues, we don’t see it stopping, and it’s going to continue on for many, many years,” he said.
Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports. And as of March 2025, the United States had more of the facilities than any other nation, according to a Statista tally. 
In other states, some of which have hundreds of data centers, the facilities have strained electric grids and, in some cases, water supplies. Yet, for now, New Hampshire is not among those: 10 relatively small-scale facilities were listed statewide on the website Data Center Map as of September 2025, putting New Hampshire in the bottom fifth nationally.
Some see an ‘emerging market.’ Others, an environmental threat.
That may, however, be set to change. Low power availability and high electricity costs have so far been the principal factors preventing an influx of data centers in New Hampshire like that seen in some other states, McGahey said. But he added that he considered the Northeast as a whole an “emerging market” for the centers.
Developers like himself, he said, were assessing different states’ regulatory landscapes, land availability, and power supplies to determine where to site new centers, which can range in size from normal office buildings to projects spanning hundreds of acres.
Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.
Citing property tax revenue and employment benefits, some legislators said they wanted to see New Hampshire create a regulatory environment that would favor data centers. 
“I think New Hampshire should court any business into the state,” said Rep. Doug Thomas, vice chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, in an interview. “In order for them to come here, there has to be a market. And so we have to … show them that we’re interested.” 
He and House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Chair Michael Vose cited construction and jobs as a primary benefit of growing data centers in New Hampshire. In his presentation, McGahey said a data center of the scale likely to be established in New Hampshire could employ as many as 40 people full-time, and potentially hundreds more during construction. 
Others questioned whether those estimates represented enough jobs to make a meaningful impact on employment. Rep. Thomas Cormen, a member of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, said in an interview the amount of people employed by data centers does not typically scale up proportionally as the centers increase in size. And, he added, for a relatively uncomplicated building like the typical warehouse-style data center, the construction phase might not last particularly long, meaning the bulk of jobs created would be temporary. 
Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries. “Some of the biggest ones employ maybe 100 to 200 people at a $40,000 (annual) salary,” Watters said. “I mean, that’s McDonalds. … They might make close to $40,000, too.”
Cormen also raised environmental concerns. Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said. This could be harmful to the river itself or cause dangerous ice dams and flooding in winter, he said. 
“I think a lot of people have environmental concerns, and power concerns,” Watters said. 
Uncertainty about how data centers would be powered, Cormen said, is another hurdle; while drawing from the grid could raise electricity costs for other ratepayers, the type and effects of unregulated local generators are another unknown.
“Before you know it, we’re talking about diesel generation,” he said. “We just don’t know.”
Speculating to meet demand
Some states have weighed implementing special rate schedules to offset the impact of increased on-grid data center demand on ratepayers, but Vose said he did not expect the New Hampshire Legislature to consider such a system in the near future.
Instead, Vose and other legislators discussed ways to increase New Hampshire’s electricity generation down the road, including through speculative technology like small, modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.
The New Hampshire Department of Energy is assessing whether SMRs could someday be implemented in New Hampshire, Director of Energy Innovation Thomas Barrasso said at the summit. SMRs could power data centers within “microgrids,” small regionalized power grids that could operate either independently of or in tandem with the rest of the grid, he said.
“I think the microgrid piece of this, the grid modernization piece of this, the SMR piece of this kind of all start to fit together,” Barrasso said.
At the summit, Barrasso expressed optimism about small modular reactors, saying he felt the tide of public opinion toward nuclear energy was changing. A Gallup poll published in April supported this impression, showing 61% of Americans in favor of nuclear power — a six percentage point increase over the previous poll in 2023.
However, SMR critics point out that the technology is still in development, questioning Barrasso’s statement at the summit that they could eventually be “plug and play” solutions to bolster New Hampshire’s energy offerings. It may be anywhere from five to 15 years before the generators could hypothetically be deployed, according to Barrasso’s presentation. 
SMRs are a “convenient” discussion for people resistant to renewable energy development, Watters said in an interview. “The interest is being driven by people who think SMRs are the answer to every problem in the world,” he said. But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.
Other technologies, including forms of renewable energy, are deployable now and could be implemented with less investment, said Dan Weeks, of solar developer ReVision Energy, at the summit. Weeks highlighted grid-scale batteries and renewable generation as other options that the state could direct attention to rather than the hypothetical future deployment of SMRs.
“Is the (Department of Energy) thinking about meeting these rising energy needs and cost concerns through … greater deployment of existing technologies that are at this point pretty far down the cost curve and probably a lot closer in the future than SMRs?” Weeks asked.
“My job was to sort of get ‘all of the above’ into the mindset of everyone,” Barrasso responded.
The Legislature has already taken some steps toward localized power generation that could be used to power facilities like data centers through SMRs. House Bill 672, sponsored by Vose and signed by Gov. Ayotte in August, paved the way for off-grid energy generators to sell power directly to buyers. Vose said he hoped that bill would “encourage” microgrids. (The bill also exempts off-grid electricity providers from renewable energy standards and the rate regulations on-grid generation is subject to.)
A resolution to declare the development of advanced nuclear technology “in the best interest of New Hampshire” also passed last session, but legislators failed to pass House Bill 710, which would have allowed utilities to own and operate SMRs. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Kevin Avard will come before the Legislature in 2026, according to a legislative service request listed on the General Court of New Hampshire website.
McGahey acknowledged the push to build data centers quickly had led developers to look toward more quickly deployable energy solutions than SMRs. In other states, developers have constructed new gas generators to meet data center demand, he said. 
“Because this race is so intense, we’re looking for solutions in two to three years. We are looking at battery storage solutions. We’re looking at natural gas plants,” McGahey said.
Looking ahead
During his presentation, McGahey forecasted demand for a wave of smaller data centers within the next three to five years. The appetite of New Hampshire policymakers and utilities toward that development, McGahey said, could play a role in determining to what extent that development progresses locally.
The reality that New Hampshire’s grid is facing, including difficulties from power shortages and aging transmission lines, may make it unlikely that the state ever sees data center development on a large scale, Watters said. 
“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’d be an interest in siting them here,” he said. 
But the possibility, and related concerns, were worth discussing, he said, and others at the summit agreed.
“We need to get people to the table to start to talk about what the future is going to look like,” Barrasso said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 05:56:29.643061

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos for New Jersey Monitor/States Newsroom.)The Ohio Supreme Court is considering the case of an Allen County man named Patrick Heffley who says he should be able to purchase firearms again, despite several domestic violence convictions.
A lower court said no, he couldn’t, but Ohio’s Third District Court of Appeals disagreed. State prosecutors appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, insisting Heffley remains under weapons disability, and is thus barred from possessing firearms.
Federal statute generally prohibits a person with a misdemeanor or felony domestic violence conviction from having a gun. It provides, however, a handful of exceptions including the state restoration of the person’s civil rights. But under Ohio statute, restoration of civil rights hinges on an individual not being “otherwise prohibited by law” from having a firearm.
“Isn’t he caught between a rock and a hard place?” Justice Pat Fischer asked.
Assistant Allen County Prosecuting Attorney John Willamowksi readily acknowledged Heffley’s in a bind.
“It is effectively one statute saying (to) the state, you go first,” he said, “and the state statute saying federal disability, you be removed (first).”
Still, Willamowski argued state law is “plain and unambiguous.” Until Heffley’s federal weapons disability is gone, he can’t have his state civil rights restored. And until his state civil rights are restored, his federal weapons disability can’t be removed.
Background
Beginning in 2000, Heffley was convicted of a string of domestic violence offenses, including one fourth degree felony in 2006. Heffley served his sentence, paid his fines and court costs and made it through parole without incident. Since his release, Heffley told the trial court, his only contact with law enforcement was getting pulled over for a seatbelt violation.
Under federal law, a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction is enough to lose gun rights and so is a “crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” Heffley was sentenced to 12 months for his felony, but the offense is punishable by up to 18 months behind bars.
In its arguments, the state leans on that felony conviction as the weapons disability keeping Heffley from getting a gun. In response, Heffley’s legal team points to a statement of legislative intent included as uncodified language in 2011’s House Bill 54.
The provision states, in no uncertain terms, that “The General Assembly is explicitly making this amendment to clarify that relief from a weapons disability (…) restores a person’s civil firearm rights to such an extent that the uniform federal ban on possessing any firearms at all (…) does not apply to that person.”
But the state dismissed that legislative language. The same section was subsequently amended — without the intent language — raising the question of whether the earlier, uncodified provision actually speaks to the current statute.
Oral arguments
More fundamentally, Heffley’s attorney Andrea Henning contends the state is misreading that “otherwise prohibited by law” provision in the underlying statute.
“Otherwise does not refer to the existence of the federal disability,” she told the justices. “It would refer to having a source other than what you’re seeking relief under.”
From Henning’s point of view, Heffley might be barred from relief if there was some other offense, but his state and federal weapons disability are fundamentally the same thing. Ohio’s courts can’t separate them for the purpose of legal analysis.
She said pitting the state and federal disabilities against one another, as the state suggests, would mean there’s Ohioans in Heffley’s shoes have little chance of ever restoring their gun rights.
“Despite,” Henning reminded them, “the legislature determining that they are worthy of an avenue to ask the court to consider granting this relief.”
Henning’s arguments resonated with some Republican members on the bench. Justices Pat Fischer and Pat DeWine pressed Willamowksi to explain away the uncodified section lawmakers approved in 2011.
“Do you think the result that you’re advocating today is what The General Assembly intended when they passed the statute?” DeWine asked. “I know the statute may say something different, but do you think that this is what they intended? That there is no way to get relief for this? That they’re in this Catch-22 circle?”
Even blunter, Fischer asked, “Why have an uncodified section? What was the point?”
Willamowski said it doesn’t really matter what lawmakers wanted — it matters what they wrote. If the General Assembly isn’t happy with the outcome, he said, they’ve got all the authority they need to change the law anytime they wish.
What’s more, Willamowski said, Heffley isn’t actually stuck in some Kafkaesque maze of contradictory laws. It might be a longshot, but he can seek a pardon or apply through the federal courts to rescind his weapons disability.
“You can apply to the United States Attorney General for relief from that federal firearms disability,” he said. “Whether individuals are regularly granted that or not, is something for the legislature to decide when they are crafting their statute here.”
And while Henning contends the state’s reading would set aside lawmakers’ stated intent, Willamowski argued the one Heffley and the appeals court favor, would create an even more “illogical” outcome.
Existing Ohio precedent holds state courts can’t remove a firearms disability that doesn’t stem from a state violation. Because federal law considers misdemeanor domestic violence grounds for weapons disability, while Ohio law does not, state courts can’t restore the gun rights of a person with a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.
“If it is interpreted as the Third District (Appeals Court) is asking it to be, it would create an instance where it would almost incentivize individuals,” Willamowski said. “If you have a felony offense in that circumstance you could get your firearm rights back, where in the misdemeanor circumstance you couldn’t do so.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/20230211gunOrama03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-22 04:56:14.445266

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Under normal conditions, a wild blueberry field would display a patchwork of greens dotted with light blue, silver or even black blueberries. 
But this summer, fields in Hancock and Washington counties also bore shades of brown. 
“You’ll see a patch that’s like really crispy, but right next to it, another plant that’s green,” said Lily Calderwood, a wild blueberry specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension. 
Calderwood spent the summer continuing a multi-year research project that looks at the benefits of applying mulch to wild blueberry fields. She’s been studying how the thickness of the mulch affects soil moisture and pest management. 
Her work has revealed a sweet spot with 1 to 1.5 inches of mulch that she has learned could even buffer the impact from early stages of droughts. But mulching would not have staved off the harm done by the dry conditions farmers saw this year. 
“Once you get to severe drought that we saw this August, it can’t replace irrigation,” she said. 
Although farmers and growers have historically been able to rely on even rainfall throughout the growing season in Maine, the agricultural community has been forced to deal with more moisture extremes. The 2020 growing season marked the driest in state history, while the wettest growing season on record came just three years later. 
In light of uncertain federal support, Common Ground Fair takes on added importance for farmers

Coping with these conditions has become a challenge for farms whose income hinges on precipitation levels and could even have larger economic effects as wild blueberries alone contribute more than $350 million annually to the state economy. Many farmers don’t have the money or expertise to plan and install irrigation infrastructure on their land, so they are hoping state support can fill those gaps. 
This particularly dry summer just so happened to coincide with the launch of a new drought relief fund that the state set up to assist farmers with the financial and technical aspects of adding irrigation systems. The program is in its nascent stages as the first round of projects were approved earlier this year. Those grants will help a couple dozen farms, but some experts worry the fund and other existing programs won’t be enough to meet the growing need. 
A “flash drought”
Prior to June, there weren’t any concerns of a drought this summer. 
The state had just come off more than a dozen rainy weekends in a row in the spring and there was decent rainfall at the end of the month. However, that changed in mid- to late-July as the state saw long stretches of little to no rain. 
“After July 21, this is when conditions started to deteriorate,” said Sean Birkel, the state climatologist and an assistant professor at the University of Maine. 
With virtually no rainfall for the second half July and the first half of August, conditions worsened. Harvesters were out in the fields in the first week of August picking plump blueberries from the stem, Calderwood said, but she remembers hearing conversations among growers about how dry it was getting. Those who had irrigation either already had it on or remarked that they should turn it on because wild blueberries require about one inch of water per week.
But it was the three-day heatwave from August 11-13 that pushed the prolonged precipitation deficit over the edge. On August 14, the National Weather Services announced a “flash drought” in parts of Maine and New Hampshire. From the fields, Calderwood said, “that is really what it felt like to a lot of farmers.” 
The plants started to turn brown and crispy. Normally the plants bounce back up as you walk through the fields, but Calderwood described how instead they crunched under their feet. Blueberries were shriveling up and even dropping to the ground. 
Thanks to the genetic diversity of Maine’s wild blueberries, some varieties are more drought resistant than others, which allowed some plants to maintain their luster. 
Birkel said a precise definition for flash drought is still debated and there are questions about the phenomenon, but this recent event gives more reason to better understand how they work.
Birkel said more analysis is needed to know how that stretch of drought compares historically, but Calderwood said it was the quickest onset of a drought she’s seen in her seven seasons. Her colleagues who have been doing this work for three decades told her the same.
Short term drought is relatively common in Maine and the northeast, Birkel said, but it’s unclear if events like the summer of 2020 or this past August will become more common or whether the state will experience fewer droughts in the future. What the data is showing is a trend toward more extremes — drier dry periods and wetter wet periods — Birkel said.  
Since mid-August, dry conditions in the northeast region have worsened with severe drought spreading from coastal Maine westward into the central part of the state, according to a Sept. 11 update from the National Integrated Drought Information System.

State relief fund
After the historic 2020 drought, Rachel Schattman, an assistant professor of sustainable agriculture at the University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture, worked with a group from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to survey the agricultural community about how they coped with the conditions. They learned that farmers need more help accessing water, Schattman said. 
She found that farmers and growers in Maine feel vulnerable to drought and see it taking a toll on their production. And although they are “starting to see irrigation as part of the cost of doing business,” they are underinvested in the necessary equipment and supplies because they haven’t needed it historically, Schattman said. 
As that research was unfolding, the state crafted a program to provide farmers with the financial and technical resources they said they need to mitigate droughts. 
The Farmers Drought Relief Fund was created by the Maine Legislature in 2021 with $1 million in startup funding and an annual appropriation of $300,000. With this fund, farmers can apply for $7,500 grants to pay for conservation planners to create water management plans or they can submit plans for specific projects such as water storage ponds or various types of wells. 
However, because of the slew of rainy Saturdays this spring, dry conditions weren’t top of mind for farmers when the state put out its first request for applications in April. Farmers were busy preparing their fields for the summer season, so the department only received 28 applications, 24 of which were funded, said Tom Gordon, a soil and water conservation program coordinator.
“Now, drought is at the forefront of farmers’ minds, and with the first round of funding out the door, we expect to have a lot of interest in applications for our second round of funding,” Gordon said, which will be announced in early 2026.
Among the successful applications, the department will fund 10 water management plans. Gordon said recent declines in federal appropriations and staffing for these services means there are actually “relatively few” conservation planners in Maine who can assist farmers. However, he said the department hopes to build this capacity in the future.
The department also funded four water storage ponds and 10 drilled wells for farms ranging in size from one to 1,100 acres. Most of them grow mixed vegetables, but some potato and wild blueberry operations also received funding. 
A “drop in the bucket” 
While Eric Venturini, executive director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine, said his organization is glad for the state relief fund and thinks it has real potential to help farmers, it’s “a drop in the bucket of what’s truly needed.”
Venturini was disappointed that applications for the first round opened up during a busy time of year for farmers and growers, but beyond that he said the Legislature can further help Maine’s agricultural industries by providing more sources of ongoing funding that deliver capital directly to farms. 
The wild blueberry industry is made up of more than 500 different farms that generate $361 million to the state’s economy annually. Venturini said that number only takes into account out-of-state fruit sales that bring money back to the state and doesn’t include in-state sales.

The hundreds of wild blueberry operations in Maine vary in size, so Venturini said some businesses have been able to modernize with technology that allows them to take on challenges like droughts. Others are more bogged down by thin profit-margins and costly conditions that not only require new, expensive infrastructure, but diminish the crop that feeds their bottom line. 
Last October, the commission received word that it would be awarded a $15.5 million federal grant that would flow to farmers to develop water sources, Venturini said. However, he also said it never came to fruition due to changes from the Trump administration, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced legislation (LD 1140) for a $45 million bond to support the state’s agricultural, food and forest product economy. 
Most of the bond would be used to invest in forest products and the dairy sector, but $2.5 million of it would be earmarked for disaster relief. That slice of money would be “very, very important” given the historic droughts the state has seen recently, Daughtry said when introducing the bill to the Legislature’s budget committee. 
The proposed bond was carried over to the next legislative session, which will begin in January. However, even if it is supported by lawmakers, it would need to go to voters through a statewide referendum for final approval. The soonest voters could take up the issue would be November 2026.
With many personal ties to the agriculture community, including her mother who ran a wild blueberry field, Daughtry reiterated to Maine Morning Star that investing in farms is particularly critical in light of the changing climate and federal funding cuts. She said it was a priority even before this summer, but the drought underscored the need for rural resilience. 
Daughtry said she appreciates that bond proposals are “one of the only times that Maine people get a direct say.” She plans to continue being a strong advocate for the proposal because it could be a “game-changing investment” for farms.
“When a bond goes on a ballot, voters are able to vote on their values and really decide whether they want to support agriculture or disaster relief or transportation,” she said.
Daughtry said the Legislature will have the chance to reevaluate the bill to determine if the proposal would be enough to address what farmers are facing. 
“The drought this summer has shown that Maine farms of all types need help ensuring their businesses can stay viable and resilient in the face of increasingly unpredictable weather conditions,” said Shelley Megquier, policy and research director for Maine Farmland Trust, who also testified in support of LD 1140. 
“Maine has established programs, such as the Farmers Drought Relief Fund, to support farmers through dry summers like this one but they need to be robustly funded and effectively implemented to have real impact.”
Beyond that, Megquier told Maine Morning Star that Maine farmers need more flexible funding they can access quickly and easily in the face of climate disasters or seasons like this summer that brought about crop loss.

Yet the state’s economy continues to lag behind the national average, a report released earlier this month says.
In all, Ohio has 177 tax exemptions or deductions worth $20 million a year or more. In its last session, the General Assembly limited or eliminated nine, but it increased the cost of others, the report by Policy Matters Ohio said. 
Tax breaks on certain people and businesses are effectively tax increases on everybody else. That’s so because government services have to be paid for, and those who remain on the tax rolls have to bear the burden.
“Unproductive tax breaks that favor corporations and wealthy Ohioans have riddled the state tax code for years,” the report said. 
At more than $8 billion a year, the state’s biggest cuts are those to businesses. 
The biggest single tax break — costing $2.5 billion a year — primarily targets supplies to manufacturers in an attempt to avoid taxing them repeatedly through the process. 
The state seems to have something to show for it. Ohio has the third-most manufacturing jobs in the U.S., and the sixth-most per 100,000 residents. 
However, other such tax breaks have long raised questions. One is the LLC tax break, which costs nearly $1 billion a year. Sold in 2013 as a way to spur job creation, it greatly limits taxes on income run through limited liability companies. 
“Wealthy individuals benefit most from the LLC loophole,” the Policy Matters report said. “In (fiscal year) 2023, a majority of filers claiming the deduction claimed less than $20,000 and received 6.9% of the total value of such deductions. Meanwhile, the 8.3% of filers who claimed $240,000 or more received 41.1% of the deductions.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe state has given up billions in revenue on that deduction and paying for the private agency JobsOhio on promises they would supercharge the job market to everyone’s benefit. But more than 25% of Ohioans are poor enough to be on Medicaid, and the state has consistently ranked in the top 10 in unemployment this year. 
Ohio also lags in a broader economic sense. Last year it ranked 28th in terms of per-capita gross domestic product.
That might mean that other business breaks also aren’t helping most Ohioans.
Unlike most states, Ohio has no tax on corporate profits. It taxes gross receipts under its “Commercial Activity Tax” instead.
In 2023, the legislature raised the threshold at which companies had to start paying it from $1 million a year to $6 million, and it eliminated certain minimum payments. Since most businesses were already paying the minimum $150 a year, more than half the benefit of the higher threshold went to businesses large enough to take in more than $6 million annually.
That tax break costs the state $1.5 billion a year, the Policy Matters report said. The increased thresholds will grow the fastest of any over the next two years, it added.
The report also faulted Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing a measure in the state budget that would have stopped new data centers from getting tax exemptions. Such centers employ few people, and they’re being blamed for rapid increases in Ohioans’ electricity bills.
“The sales tax exemption for data centers, one of the state’s fast-growing tax breaks, will be worth $289.9 million over the FY 2026-27 biennium, according to the Tax Expenditure Report, and probably a lot more if more recently announced investments were included,” JobsOhio researchers wrote. “In many cases, the exemption amounts to as much as $1 million for each data-center job created.”
The tax breaks persist even as lawmakers plead poverty when it comes to funding public education. Abandoning an earlier commitment to pony up at least $666 million more for education over the next two years, the budget DeWine signed slashed that amount by about two-thirds. Meanwhile, the legislature found $600 million to help the billionaire owners of the Cleveland Browns build a new stadium outside the city.
The Policy Matters Ohio report said the legislature opted to look past evidence that some tax breaks weren’t performing as promised. In 2016, the General Assembly passed a bipartisan bill to create a Tax Expenditure Review Committee.
“However, lawmakers found living up to the promise of good government harder than anticipated,” the report said. “They eliminated the (review committee) in the 2022-23 budget bill, after a weak review of 15 sales-tax breaks and failing to carry out its mandates at all in the 2020-21 budget period.”
That and other factors mean that once tax breaks are signed into law, reform is “excruciatingly difficult,” the report said.

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.
But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.


So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.


Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.


And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”


“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.


He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.


 Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.


But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCurrently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.


While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”


Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”


But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.


The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.


 What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.


“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.


The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.


Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.


Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.


Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.


Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.


Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.
With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Here’s one guarantee from Kansas Reflector: We’re not soaked in drugs and sent through the mail.
That’s the curious claim made by the state Department of Corrections after it decided to cancel all print newspaper subscriptions purchased for inmates by outside parties. That’s right — state officials believe that your hometown gazette is at risk of being infused in a mind-altering substance and carried by the Postal Service. Publishers and the Kansas Press Association have protested mightily, but the department has refused to offer any specifics about the supposed threat.
As I said, a good reason to turn to the all-digital Kansas Reflector. The only mind-altering substance we’re infused with is great reporting and community commentary. If you really want to taint us with drugs in some way, I suppose you can print out some of our stories and do so in the privacy of your own home.
If it sounds like I’m not taking these stories from the state seriously, that’s because I’m not.
Kansas Reflector reporter Anna Kaminski wrote about the change Sept. 8: “Previously, families of incarcerated people could take out a newspaper subscription in a person’s name and have it delivered to a state facility. The agency says it made the change, forbidding newspaper subscriptions paid for by outside parties, for safety. … The new policy requires people serving time in state facilities to request a subscription on their own, undergo an approval process and pay for the subscription out of their commissary accounts.”
After that initial story was published, prison spokesman David Thompson wrote in an email to Kaminski: “The impetus for this policy is an increase in drug-soaked material, such as books and newspapers, being transmitted to residents through the USPS.”
The department provided no evidence that this had happened in Kansas.
Let’s consider for a moment what it would mean for newspapers to actually pose such a threat. What is the corrections department actually suggesting? It seems to me one of two astonishingly improbable scenarios.
First off, it suspects that a newspaper publisher somewhere in the Sunflower State actually has been coating his or her publication with drugs and sending it through the mail. It’s already tough enough making ends meet in this business. Why would owners and operators of local papers open themselves up to such threats?
Secondly, they think that the mail has somehow been intercepted along its path from publisher to prison. That would be a federal crime. And while I understand that legal ramifications don’t deter everyone, surely these canny drug smugglers would want to spread drugs on more durable paper than newsprint. Have you ever tried to even wrap a mug in newspaper? It’s not that durable!
The final and wildest part of all this is that the actual restriction doesn’t fit the supposed risk.
Kansas has forbidden friends and family from buying inmates newspaper subscriptions. But inmates themselves can still purchase the subscriptions. So if the infrastructure already exists to ship newspapers-as-drugs into prisons, the only thing that needs to change is the person actually buying the subscription (and perhaps the prison’s approval process, however that works).
Here’s the bottom line. Prisons and those who run them want control over their institutions and inmates. Contact with the outside world — be it mail, visits or internet — poses potential risks to inmate and staff safety. Officials want to lower those potential risks.
That makes sense. But it can lead to ridiculous situations like this one, where the action taken doesn’t lead to the stated goals and make no sense besides.
Believe me, we wanted to hear more from the state about this. Kaminski and others at Kansas Reflector and the Kansas Press Association have sought extra information and explanations. We would be happy to understand more about officials’ thinking and share it with our readers. Perhaps my absurd scenarios aren’t so absurd after all.
But they have refused to do so. We’re left with a ham-fisted restriction on the free access to information. That leaves all of us, not just prisoners, worse off.

(Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images)Amid the recent roiling seas of public murder and on-purpose mayhem came the news that film star Robert Redford had died at 89. As one among millions who enjoyed his movies — whether acting or directing — I have always been especially struck by Redford’s persona … his off-screen character.
Or, more to the point, struck by the contrast between his persona and what we see too much these days on multiple screens.
A caution: Drawing conclusions about actors can be tricky. Their storytelling universe depends on make believe. That reality, however, should neither diminish the message of their films nor paint thespians and the stories they tell with a broad brush, regardless of genre.
Still, exploring Redford’s life, what he valued and with whom he surrounded himself, reveals a fairly clear picture. Of particular interest were the observations of those closest to him both inside and outside the movie business. 
What emerged off the screen, without the patina and greasepaint of such legendary characters as Roy Hobbs and Butch Cassidy, the notoriety of Bob Woodward or his many other memorable roles in a lengthy career, was an intelligent, passionate, unassuming and polite grownup. 
So the news that he had passed gave me pause for more than the loss of a gifted artist with a long and distinguished body of work. We coulduse more examples of his quiet, powerful persona. In a field where success is often measured by the size and duration of the spotlight, he seemed to neither seek nor relish its glow, which is antithetical to a world where likes, retweets and influencers are commodities by which we calculate importance.    
That said, Redford was no modern Marlboro Man or a fence-riding desperado avoiding the public. He was, after all, an actor, whose work is consumed by the public — making him a public figure. Yet, when he could afford to leave the concrete and cacophony of Hollywood, he made Utah his home, far from the freeways and frenzy of his native Southern California. 
Nor was he reclusive … or silent. Instead, in addition to his professional life and his establishing of the Sundance Institute for independent filmmakers, Redford chose social activism, especially environmental causes, issues facing Indigenous people and the plight of the LGBTQ+ community. 
Redford led successful campaigns against a power plant in Utah and a six-lane highway that would have spoiled a canyon area near his home. He lobbied Congress to pass the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. At the time of his death, he had been a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council for over 50 years.
The upheaval and angst of the last couple weeks are at once disheartening and instructive. We watched as screaming, yelling and blaming have continued apace about everything from secret files to murderous motives to unhinged hatred. We learned that constitutionally protected speech apparently ends before late-night television begins. 
Many have gasped when experts — you remember experts, those in a particular field with advanced educations, considerable experience and the respect of their peers — reported that public health decisions were being based on poor science or worse, none. We stared in disbelief as some leaders argued for  governmental stamps of approval on thought and speech.
The result is undeniable. Many of the world’s rounded corners have become sharp, unforgiving to those who bump against them. As we approach 250 years as a nation, nearly six in ten Americans hold pessimistic views of the future, according to data from the Pew Research Center. 
When a general unease about tomorrow is afoot, you can never have too many real adults in the room. Redford’s passing means one fewer.
He once said, “… in keeping diversity alive, it will help keep our industry alive. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift, and not one to be taken lightly.”
He spoke those words in 2002, when the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences awarded him an Honorary Oscar for prompting and supporting independent filmmaking. Their metaphorical underpinning, however, defies today’s frightening move away from diversified thought and expression and toward some monolithic political viewpoint. 
Robert Redford was a movie star. Perhaps his brightest light, however, illuminated and embraced his defense of art, the environment and the freedom to express one’s self and — especially — his character in doing so.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)“For just as weakness is a disease of the body, so wickedness is a disease of the mind.”  — Boethius, “The Consolation of Philosophy”
Usually, politicians will bloviate during campaigns about all the wonderful, transformative things they’ll do if voted into office. Most fall far short of their promises; others use smoke-and-mirrors or sleight-of-hand to distract the public from their shortcomings.
But in Donald Trump’s case, in the early days of his second term, he has used a raft of executive orders, staffing shifts, and slashed budgets to disassemble parts of the federal government, including entire agencies. He has concentrated on significantly reducing the federal workforce and deleting regulatory agencies.
He has been making good on his vow to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Even before he assumed office, Trump and a coterie of far-right billionaires, bigots, kooks, and shadowy entities began building the framework to make this nightmare real.
Gov. Ron DeSantis built one concentration camp deep in the Florida Everglades and just opened another at the closed Baker Correctional Institution. It now holds 117 people but has the capacity to hold 1,500, according to DeSantis administration officials. The site is about 45 miles west of Jacksonville near the Osceola National Forest.
CNN says DeSantis is “doubling down” on his plans to build a third detention site in Florida’s Panhandle, which he has dubbed “Panhandle Pokey,” along with another facility at a Florida National Guard training center known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville.
Other states are jumping on the bandwagon with other proposed immigration facilities, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer” and Louisiana’s “Camp 57,” located at Angola Prison farm, an 18,000-acre plantation sitting an hour north of Baton Rouge.
Trump and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have successfully linked immigration with crime and we are watching dragnets in Florida cities and across the country with untold numbers of undocumented and legal immigrants being swept up.
But Trump couldn’t do this alone. Much like Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, or Leopold II of Belgium, a whole bunch of people need to sign onto your vision and they must be willing to build the legal, ideological, and logistical infrastructure needed to pull this off.
That’s where Ron DeSantis comes in. On this issue, DeSantis is an eager underling, working since June in concert with the Trump administration. He, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and others have embarked on an unprincipled, sadistic crusade of indiscriminately disappearing, imprisoning, and deporting Latino, Black, and Brown immigrants.
The Trump and DeSantis administrations lacked legal authority to do what they’ve been doing, but they have bent laws and ignored precedent and norms to trample on immigrants’ rights.
Domination
It becomes clearer by the day that the imposition of white domination, power, and control of the state and the country animates everything DeSantis and Trump are doing.
DeSantis has fervently signed on to the MAGA Republican white nationalist project of dragging the United States back to a time when European Americans ruled the roost using brute force; murder; laws, customs and norms; and terrorism and fear to intimidate and control African Americans.
Florida has served as the petri dish for DeSantis and his enablers to roll out the far-right agenda and gauge the public response or acceptance of these policies. Whether it’s banning books, laws seeking to curb or erase gay and trans individuals, anti-Black and anti-DEI bias, whitewashing facts, rewriting history, and attacking African Americans and other marginalized groups.
We are witnessing American apartheid, with the use of a range of mechanisms to more fully marginalize those who DeSantis and Trump deem “the other.” As the ACLU reminds us, DeSantis has joined Trump in amplifying already strained racial tensions in the United States. Both have been brazen in their overt quest to weaponize anger, resentment, and racial grievance.
Political content producer Danielle Moodie notes that Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, and a white nationalist Supreme Court are dismantling democracy, civil rights, and America’s economy.
“Isn’t it remarkable how the Supreme Court can rule in one breath that race cannot be considered in college admissions — stripping away affirmative action — and in the next, empower ICE to racially profile, detain, and harass Latinos simply for speaking Spanish in Los Angeles?” Moodie asks. “This hypocrisy reveals a troubling truth: The Court claims to be color-blind when protecting opportunity, yet suddenly sees race when it comes to criminalization, detention, and fear.”
Moodie added: “This contradiction is not just a legal nuance. It is a reflection of how deeply embedded white supremacy remains within our institutions. And under Donald Trump’s leadership, aided by his handpicked justices, the Supreme Court has become less an arbiter of justice and more an enabler of authoritarianism.”
The immediate result: Immigrants — documented and undocumented — are being disappeared by ICE agents without reasonable suspicion. The far-right faction is allowing federal and state law enforcement agents to confront and detain anyone who looks Latino, speaks little or no English, and gathers in certain places where Latinos congregate.
This blessing granted by the high court of racial profiling allows gangs of ICE, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, ATF, and others to hunt down immigrants, the vast majority of whom have committed no crime.
Moodie notes that the Supreme Court, its credibility at an all-time low, stripped away affirmative action in higher education; handed presidential immunity to Donald Trump while he faced multiple indictments; and enabled a wave of anti-immigrant policies that echo the darkest chapters of American history.
“Chief Justice John Roberts will likely be remembered not as a guardian of the Constitution, but as the leader who rolled back a century of progress on civil rights,” she said.
Theatrics
Critics including James Greenberg, emeritus professor of anthropology at The University of Arizona, have been warning about the authoritarian path that DeSantis and MAGA Republicans elsewhere are laying out. They mean to stoke fear and compel compliance.
“These theatrics work like rituals. Military vehicles rumble through desert towns, children in cages, recruitment ads with warriors silhouetted against flags  — all ceremonies of fear,” Greenberg said. “They draw sharp lines of belonging and exclusion, marking who belongs and who is cast out. Raids at dawn, walls built for cameras, soldiers posing for photo ops are repeated gestures that turn cruelty into liturgy, weaving it into civic life until it looks ordinary.”
“Power has left marks on the land and surveillance has become a terrain of expansion,” Greenberg added.
“Tools once built to track foreign terrorists now target immigrants, activists, journalists, even civil servants. Private tech firms fused with federal agencies, creating databases that sweep up social media posts, license plate scans, phone metadata, and travel patterns,” he said. “These systems persist without oversight. Algorithms flag ‘suspicious behavior’ that often means nothing more than speaking out, worshiping differently, or crossing paths with the wrong people.”
Those who resist are surveilled by drones, have their phones and laptops searched at airports and border crossings.
“The effect is not only to collect data but to intimidate, to show people they are always visible. Surveillance has become a system of control, a constant warning that belonging can be questioned at any time,” said Greenberg.
“Detention has followed the same logic. Private prison companies, once in retreat, under Trump found new life. Contracts multiplied, decommissioned facilities reopened, tent cities sprouted in remote deserts. These sites were deliberately hard to reach, far from lawyers and reporters. Images of overcrowded cells and children behind fences remain etched in memory as proof of how cruelty is normalized.”
In total, detention “has always been as much spectacle as policy, a ritual of exclusion designed to instill fear before it processes anyone,” he continued.
“Inside, migrants are fingerprinted, DNA-tested, and placed in systems that reduce human beings to biometric codes. What looks like confinement is both political theater and an extraction of data and profits,” Greenberg said.
“Family separation reveals the cruelty in its starkest form. Parents deported without their children. By severing the most basic bonds of belonging, the state redefined what it means to be part of the nation. Citizenship papers could not shield children from being rendered effectively stateless if their parents were removed. Belonging is treated as a privilege that can be revoked at will.”
The deeper truth, Greenberg warns, is that repression relies on infrastructure.
“Prisons, surveillance grids, militarized zones — once built, rarely vanish. They remain in place for whoever comes next,” he said. “Like irrigation canals dug centuries ago, they channel flows of power long after their builders are gone. Trump accelerated this process, turning the latent into the active, the possible into the real.”
Depending on who you ask, there are those who believe that it’s already too late to reverse what DeSantis, Trump, the orchestrators of Project 2025, and MAGA Republicans are doing, while others believe America still has time.
Regardless of where you stand, what are we prepared to do to dismantle this architecture of tyranny?

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-22 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"After Bridgeport, why no ballot reform?",Peter A. Thalheim,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/22/no-legislative-fix-for-bridgeports-absentee-ballot-scandal/,Our Democratic Party of Connecticut has been benefiting from a corrupt Bridgeport balloting for decades which is why election reform is unlikely.,"Andrew Brown of the Connecticut Mirror posed a poignant question in his June 26 piece reporting that Bridgeport elections scandals fail to inspire new laws. 
How is it that with “seven political operatives, campaign workers and elected officials currently facing charges for allegedly manipulating Bridgeport’s absentee voting system” no pieces of legislation to end a long string of election-related crime in Bridgeport made it into law in Connecticut in 2025?
The answer is because Connecticut is dirty. You don’t even have to show a government issued photo ID like a Connecticut driver’s license or non-driver photo identification card to vote, even though the vast majority of Americans support just such a requirement, across all races and ethnicities.
But that would make it harder for the Democratic Party of Connecticut to have people cheat on its behalf. Of the seven political operatives presently facing charges, five are associated with the Bridgeport Democratic Party. More than 150 charges have been filed according to Brown’s article on the “most significant criminal prosecution of election-related crime in Connecticut history.” It should be noted that all criminal defendants are innocent until proven guilty or they admit to a criminal charge.
According to the Chief State’s Attorney’s office, the charges include absentee voting irregularities, forged signatures, registering non-citizens to vote, illegally telling people how to vote, changing votes after they were cast and harvesting ballots to deliver to ballot drop boxes. The poster child for this whole nest of corruption is alleged to be Wanda Geter-Pataky, vice-chair of the Bridgeport Democratic Party.
But do not lose sight of why this corruption exists in Bridgeport. It benefits the Connecticut Democratic Party statewide! 
The more votes the Bridgeport Democratic Party can manufacture and send to Hartford, the better the election outcome for Democrats in statewide contests and in the 4th U.S. Congressional district. The Democrats control the five constitutional offices of governor (Ned Lamont), lieutenant governor (Susan Bysiewicz), attorney general (William Tong), secretary of state (Stephanie Thomas) and treasurer (Erick Russell). They also hold the two U.S. senate seats in Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal as well as the 4th U.S. Congressional District (Jim Himes).
Our Democratic Party of Connecticut has been benefiting from a corrupt Bridgeport for decades and it has no intention of stopping the voting scandals, which is why election reform is unlikely. 
Our Democrat Party has made a deal with the devil. In Goethe’s Faust, Dr. Faust is offered help by Mephistopheles, the Devil, to know, in a Biblical sense, the young maiden Gretchen. In exchange, Faust bets Mephistopheles that Mephistopheles can never make Faust so content that he will wish that moment to last forever.
The deal that our Democrat Party has made is that the Democratic Party of Bridgeport can abuse the election rights and expectations of Bridgeport residents to maintain the dominance of the Bridgeport Democratic Party over Bridgeport in exchange for the Bridgeport Democrats producing as many Democrat votes as they can as Connecticut’s largest city to elect Democrats statewide, the two U.S. senators and in the 4th U.S. Congressional District.
One result of this deal with the devil is one of the slowest state economies of all 50 states! Connecticut was one of the last states to regain the jobs lost in the 2008-2009 Great Recession in 2024. We are saddled with a corrupt political class.
Housing has been made so expensive to permit and build that it has been put out of reach for young buyers and young families. Connecticut has a high cost of living as well as anemic economic growth. The residents who leave this progressive paradise have a higher education level and more assets than residents who replace them with lower education and assets which is a loss to the entire state.
And who is the personification of this corruption of Bridgeport? In my opinion it is Mayor Joseph Ganim. After serving as mayor from 1991-2003 he was convicted of 16 federal counts in racketeering, extortion, conspiracy, bribery, mail fraud and filing a false tax return. According to Wikipedia, Ganim shook down Bridgeport city contractors for more than half a million dollars in cash, food, wine, clothing, home renovations and diamonds. He was sentenced to nine years in prison and about $475,000 in fines and restitution. He was released in 2010 after seven years in prison.
Part of prison is the concept of redemption and paying for your crime. Based on that Ganim again ran for mayor in 2015 and won. All slates were clear at that point.
I met Ganim twice in the campaign of 2017-18 when I ran for governor. The first time was after I had met with a civil rights advocate in the African American community in 2017 and then in April 2018 when the NAACP of Connecticut sponsored a gubernatorial debate in New Haven on prisoner re-entry into society. Present were candidates Lamont, Bysiewicz, Guy Smith, Ganim and me. My impression of Ganim was of an energetic and positive politician with a gregarious nature that would make you comfortable in his presence.
In 2019, when State Sen. Marilyn Moore opposed Mayor Ganim in the Bridgeport Democratic primary for mayor, Moore beat Ganim in the city’s voting booths, but she lost because of the city’s absentee ballots. How convenient for Mayor Ganim.
So here we are in 2025. Bridgeport Democrat Party operatives and members are charged with election fraud, complete with videos that appear to show ballot box stuffing. Again, all individuals are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
But the Connecticut legislature, controlled by Democrats, and the governor, a Democrat, have done nothing to clean this rot.
And so Connecticut will continue to be at the bottom of economic performance of the 50 states in growth as the pain of progressive policies continue to drown the state.
Andrew Brown: To answer your cogent question: no legislation tightening up against the election fraud alleged in Bridgeport happened in Hartford this year because Connecticut is a dirty state. 
Never say never, however, as even Dr. Faust changed course and with the intercession of Gretchen, whom he had betrayed, his soul was redeemed.

On his show last week, Kimmel said that Trump’s supporters were “desperately trying” to paint Tyler Robinson (the alleged assassin) “as anything other than one of them.”
Anyone who follows the news and monitors social media will conclude that Kimmel’s statement was largely accurate. Indeed, many in the Trump administration including the vice president went out of their way to suggest that a radical network of left-wing extremists was behind the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk even as this claim stood in contrast to the evidence presented by law enforcement.
ABC’s suspension of the Jimmy Kimmel show came right after Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission chairman, threatened in an interview that he would consider punishing the local stations that carried Kimmel’s show. Carr’s comments were swiftly followed by announcements from several stations with ABC affiliates that they would move to cancel Kimmel’s show.
In the wake of the Charlie Kirk murder, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that the Justice Department would target groups and individuals that were employing hate speech. When reporters pointed out to Bondi that hate speech is generally protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, she seemed to walk back some of her initial comments. Nonetheless, by then the Trump Administration’s threatening message was resonating.
The canceling of the Jimmy Kimmel show is nothing less than a cynical attack on one of the most sacred liberties in a democracy—the freedom of speech and expression. Trump applauded this canceling in a tweet, ironically negating his own remarks from the second inaugural address in January 2025 when he vowed to “immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.”

An excerpt from President Donald Trump’s January 20 inaugural address.
Yet even more troubling than the attack on free speech by the Trump administration is the culture of fear and intimidation that they have created since coming into office nine months ago. Earlier this week, President Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times and book publisher Penguin Random House. The lawsuit focuses on a book about Trump by two New York Times reporters and three “false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging” articles that he says were aimed at sabotaging his chances in the 2024 presidential election.
The suit was dismissed last Friday by a federal court judge, but a report by PBS observes that “Trump has filed lawsuits against outlets whose coverage he dislikes, threatened to revoke TV broadcast licenses and sought to bend news organizations and social media companies to his will.” Such tactics are akin to those used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and are aimed at chipping away at political freedoms and independent media while consolidating power.
An independent media is not the only institution that has been targeted by the second Trump administration. Upon assuming office in January, one of the first actions of this administration was to withhold research funding and exert tremendous political pressures on major universities like Columbia and Harvard.
Columbia, the first to capitulate to the demands of the Trump Administration, agreed in March to overhaul its protest policies, security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. In the case of Harvard, the government insisted that it change hiring and admissions in departments that “lack viewpoint diversity” and “immediately shutter” any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. Even if one agrees with some of the demands of the Trump Administration, the tactics they are using to secure compliance are not consistent with dialogue and negotiation, which is how healthy democratic societies pursue change.
We should also remember the executive order signed by Trump, which targeted prestigious law firms like Paul Weiss for conducting work or hiring lawyers that the White House disfavors. Weiss ultimately reached a deal with the administration that enabled the firm to get out from the penalties imposed by the order. According to an article in Politico, “eight firms followed that precedent in order to avoid becoming targeted themselves, ultimately committing a combined total of nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal services to largely unspecified initiatives supported by the Trump administration.”
Taken together, the actions of the Trump Administration amount to much more than bullying a network to cancel a late-night talk show or censoring the negative coverage that the President is receiving. What is at stake here is a concerted effort to establish a culture of fear and intimidation, one in which media organizations, non-profits, and ordinary citizens must think twice about critiquing and challenging the government.
 As we approach the 250th anniversary of the American experiment in democracy, we should remember that our founders called on us to vigorously resist any efforts to curtail our fundamental rights and liberties.

A single historical example or a set number of victims does not define genocide. Instead, “Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent” –inferred or explicit- “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:

Killing members of the group;
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”

Braffman’s effort to minimize Israel’s crimes finds no support in fact or law. But don’t take our word for it, listen to world experts.  Early on in Israel’s assault on Gaza, more than 800 scholars and practitioners of international law and genocide studies signed a public statement “to sound the alarm about the possibility of the crime of genocide being perpetrated by Israeli forces against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.” Such concern arose not only from Israel’s ruthless bombing of civilians but from the many statements of genocidal intent spewing from Israeli leaders. 
The International Court of Justice’s interim ruling in January 2024 ordered Israel to prevent genocide, punish incitement to genocide, and enable provisions of basic services and humanitarian assistance to reach Gaza. In March 2024, the ICJ further ordered Israel to stop the invasion of Rafah and to reopen the Rafah crossing to humanitarian aid deliveries. But Israel ignored these provisional measures.
Amnesty International issued a report in December 2024 that “Israel has carried out acts prohibited under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza.” Likewise, Human Rights Watch concluded that “Israeli authorities” were “responsible for the crime against humanity of extermination and for acts of genocide. Professor Omar Bartov, who had previously served in the Israeli Defense Force, reached the “inescapable conclusion” in July 2025 that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. In July, B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization recognized that “the Israeli regime is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.” 
The International Association of Genocide Scholars declared  on August 31, 2025, that “Israel’s policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide.” On September 16, the United Nations’ Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory published a report that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since October 17, 2023.
Each day, Israel starves Palestinian children and murders and maims more civilians with the Trump administration’s support. On September 18, the U.S. cast its sixth veto on a U.N. Security Council resolution concerning a Gaza ceasefire. A report issued by Brown University’s Cost of War Project estimates that in the one year ending September 30, 2024, the U.S. government provided $22.76 billion in military-related aid to Israel. 
Just before leaving office, the Biden administration notified Congress of additional munitions sales totaling $8 billion that the Trump administration subsequently approved. In February 2025, the State Department approved $6.75 billion in munitions sales, including 500-pound bombs. A missile sales package, valued at $660 million, was also approved in February 2025. In July 2025, the State Department approved $510 million sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions.
As of September 2025, the confirmed death toll in Gaza surpassed 65,000, including more than 20,000 children and 1,000 babies under one year old.  Even though 84% of the American electorate favors an immediate ceasefire, Congress, in contravention of the Leahy Law, continues its unconditional support for Israel.  
Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut joined with Republicans in July in opposing the Joint Resolutions of Disapproval that would limit certain weapons to Israel, supported by 27 senators, including Sen. Chris Murphy. Thus far, U.S. Reps. John Larson, Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro, Jim Himes, and Jahana Hayes have refused to unite with 49 congressional Democrats to co-sponsor H.R. 3565 to ban weapons to Israel. 
We guess that Elaine Braffman is quite happy with that result. But as for us, and most of the Connecticut electorate, we do not want our government and tax dollars supporting Israel’s Gaza genocide.

Interspersed in his comments about Kirk, Trump aimed insults at what he described as “radical left lunatics,” promoted his anti-crime campaign and teased a forthcoming announcement from the administration regarding autism. Vance spoke about his friendship with Kirk and attributed the electorate’s swing to conservatism to Kirk’s outreach, saying Kirk “changed the course of American history.”Vance joined Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi in recent days calling for consequences for Americans who criticized Kirk following his death. During his remarks at the memorial, Vance said he saw “the very worst parts of humanity” in comments and social media posts.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recounted meeting Kirk a decade ago when “he was building a movement.”“I still have this sticker (that reads) ‘Big Government Sucks,’” Hegseth said, recalling an early campaign slogan for Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk co-founded in 2012.Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, said those devoted to Kirk will “defeat the forces of darkness and evil.”“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk. You made him immortal,” Miller said.Kirk’s wife Erika Kirk confirmed she will now sit at the helm of Turning Point USA as the nonprofit’s CEO after several speakers who heralded the organization’s future alluded to the change.In an emotional speech, she told those in attendance that she has forgiven the suspected shooter.“I forgive him because it was what Christ did. It is what Charlie would do, the answer to hate is not hate,” Erika Kirk said. During his remarks, Trump jokingly apologized to Erika because he said he “can’t stand” his opponents.Kirk “did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That’s where I disagreed with him. I hate my opponents and don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry, Erika,” Trump said.Musk, members of Congress in attendanceThe memorial service began at 11 a.m. Mountain time at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which seats upwards of 60,000.A large painting of Kirk, who was fatally shot 11 days ago at age 31, was displayed on stage. Large LED screens played videos and displayed photos of the activist, who was very influential among Republicans and conservatives.A seven-piece band backed Christian singer Chris Tomlin as Trump administration officials walked onto the floor of the stadium. Cameras captured the entrances of Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. All delivered speeches.Billionaire Elon Musk, a major donor to Trump’s 2024 campaign and the former leader of Trump’s government efficiency project, entered the stadium to cheers, according to CNN. Cameras caught Trump and Musk shaking hands and apparently speaking while seated together prior to Trump’s remarks.Current and former U.S. senators and representatives were among members of the audience, including former Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz. A U.S. military color guard displayed flags during the national anthem.The memorial service was livestreamed and is available on C-SPAN.Journalists outside the stadium reported thousands of people lining up early hoping to attend the ceremony. Kirk was fatally shot by a suspected lone gunman on Sept. 10 while he was speaking at Utah Valley University, according to authorities, who are seeking the death penalty. NBC reported Saturday that law enforcement officials have not found any link between Kirk’s shooting and left-wing groups.Utah native Tyler Robinson, 22, is charged on seven counts, including aggravated murder, violent offense in the presence of a child and witness tampering. Authorities say Robinson sent text messages about “hatred” to his roommate following the shooting. Charging documents say Robinson’s parents recounted their son’s recent interest in LGBTQ rights and that he had started to “lean more to the left.”Charlie Kirk called a ‘martyr’Speakers praised Kirk’s work and at numerous points during the ceremony referred to him as a “martyr” for the conservative movement and Christianity.Far-right YouTube commentator Benny Johnson referred to Kirk’s “revival spirit” and influence in spreading a Christian worldview.“Charlie Kirk is a martyr in the true Christian tradition. You take out a tyrant, his power goes away. You cut down a martyr, his power grows,” Johnson said.Johnson called out Trump administration officials in the crowd as “rulers of our land.”  “May we pray that our rulers here, rightfully instituted and given power by our God, wield the sword for the terror of evil men in our nation, in Charlie's memory. I want to live in a country where the evil are terrified, and where the good and the faithful and the moral people of our nation can live in peace, debate in peace, disagree in peace and start families in peace.”GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida said she owed her political career to Kirk, who hired her to do outreach to young Hispanic voters.“These were the sparks that lit the path for me on the eve of my departure to medical school to decide to change course and join TP USA, where I could help Charlie battle the socialist indoctrination on college campuses,” Luna said.The U.S. House passed a resolution Friday honoring Kirk, supported by all Republicans and 95 Democrats.Presidents and memorial servicesIt is notable for a sitting president, vice president and multiple Cabinet members to deliver remarks at a memorial service for a private citizen. Trump ordered flags lowered after Kirk’s death.Trump spoke, along with Republican congressional leaders, at the U.S. Capitol in 2018 at a memorial for the late evangelist Billy Graham, who had relationships with U.S. presidents going back decades, with Graham lying in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Trump ordered flags at half-staff.President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy for the nine victims of the racially motivated mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Notably, Obama spontaneously sang “Amazing Grace.” Obama did not order flags lowered following the massacre.Kirk maintained professor watch list, hosted podcastKirk was born in 1993 in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights.He co-founded Turning Point USA aiming to mobilize conservative youth and young adults on high school and college campuses. Kirk toured campuses across the U.S. speaking on contemporary hard-right topics, including anti-LGBTQ positions and encouraging young women to retreat from careers and return to the home. Among the organization’s projects was the “Professor Watchlist” that published the names of professors across the country in searchable format by categories including “anti-Christian views,” “feminism,” “climate alarmist” and “racial ideology,” according to its web page.Kirk hosted “The Charlie Kirk Show,” a successful daily radio show and podcast. Devoting an entire episode in July to the Jeffrey Epstein case, Kirk was among those in Trump’s voter base to urge the president to release more information about the federal investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender.  Kirk’s work garnered attention beyond the United States. Rev. Rob McCoy, Kirk’s pastor, recounted a recent trip to South Korea “Charlie looked at politics as an on-ramp to Jesus,” McCoy told the crowd.Turning Point USA Inc., which has been tax exempt since 2014, reported $84.9 million in revenue in 2024, according to the organization’s publicly available 990 tax forms published on ProPublica’s Nonprofit Explorer.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-21 19:56:55.778071

What’s next in the 2026 race?,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/pa-gop-endorses-garrity-for-governor-whats-next-in-the-2026-race/,The state party didn’t endorse a candidate for lieutenant governor.,"Stacy Garrity, Pennsylvania’s 78th treasurer, delivers her inaugural address Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, at The Forum Auditorium in Harrisburg, Pa., kicking off her second term in office. (Commonwealth Media Services)The Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsed state Treasurer Stacy Garrity in the 2026 race for governor during its fall state committee meeting in State College over the weekend.
Garrity, the only candidate nominated on the floor, was approved by a voice vote. A significant majority said “aye” in their support, while there were just a few ‘no’s’ in the crowd when asked if the party should endorse her in the race.
During her acceptance speech, Garrity highlighted her small town roots in Bradford County, plus her experience as a combat veteran and elected official as reasons why she’s positioned to take on incumbent Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro next year.
“While Josh Shapiro has taken more and more of your money, my office has returned more than a billion dollars to its rightful owners,” she said. “Rather than empowering bureaucracy to stop progress, we created Pennsylvania Money Match, removing red tape, and returning more than $40 million to Pennsylvania taxpayers.”
“And that is the fundamental contrast in this race,” she added. “While Josh Shapiro seeks to take more from you, I am running for governor to give back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Garrity was first elected as state treasurer in 2020 after defeating incumbent Democrat Joe Torsella by just under one point. Her victory over the Montgomery County Democrat was seen as an upset and then she cruised to reelection in 2024.
Garrity claimed that Shapiro’s GSD “get stuff done” phrase is all talk and criticized his administration on a variety of policy issues including energy, crime, and education.
“Let’s be clear, Josh Shapiro has one priority, and it’s not you,” Garrity said. “Josh Shapiro’s priority is Josh Shapiro and the contrast between us could not be clearer.”
Garrity also stated that she’s not running for governor “as a stepping stone to something bigger,” a not-so-veiled jab at Shapiro for his reported interest in potentially running for president in 2028.
“My message to families all across our great commonwealth: help is on the way,” Garrity said. “And with your help, we’ll make Pennsylvania a safer, a stronger and a more prosperous place to raise your family and grow your business today and for years to come.”
On Saturday, Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Eugene DePasquale issued a statement saying that Garrity has sold out Pennsylvanians every chance she’s gotten and that she couldn’t be trusted in the governor’s office.
“Stacy Garrity has a long track record of views and positions that are wrong for Pennsylvania,” DePasquale wrote.
He criticized Garrity for supporting President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he said will negatively impact health care, energy jobs, and taxes.
“She has long fought for an extreme anti-choice agenda – celebrating the fall of Roe v. Wade and even selling anti-abortion merchandise,” DePasquale wrote.
Since launching her 2026 bid for governor, Politico reports that Garrity has stopped selling the anti-abortion merchandise on her campaign website and said she would not support a state abortion ban if elected, although she avoided directly answering questions about her position on the issue during an interview with Politico in September.
DePasquale also criticized Garrity for speaking at a rally in January 2021 that questioned the integrity of the 2020 election.
Garrity has since walked those comments back.
As the 2026 campaign plays out, Garrity and Shapiro still have to work with one another in their current roles in elected office.
Garrity said her bid for governor hasn’t changed the way she will be working with him.
“This is not personal. I just have a very different vision for our commonwealth,” Garrity told reporters. “It hasn’t changed at all.”
The 2026 general election is over a year away, but a trio of national ratings outlets, the Cook Political Report, Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and Inside Elections, indicate that Shapiro is the favorite, rating the race as “likely Democratic.”
Following the endorsement meeting, Garrity is set to embark on a week-long trip kicking off her campaign, dubbed the “Help is on the Way Tour,” and visit five different regions in the state for rallies.
Each rally will take place in counties that Shapiro won in 2022 over Mastriano. During Garrity’s successful reelection bid in 2024, she won three of those counties – Cumberland, Erie, and Bucks, while losing in more-Democratic friendly Allegheny and Lackawanna counties. 
Will Garrity have a clear path to the nomination?
Although Garrity now has the formal support of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, it does not necessarily mean that she will be the only candidate seeking the nomination.
State Sen. Doug Mastriano, who was the GOP gubernatorial candidate in 2022 and lost to Shapiro by double digits, has been teasing a 2026 run for months through social media posts and interviews.

Mastriano secured the GOP nomination for governor in 2022 during a crowded primary that saw the state party largely stay on the sidelines, while Trump delivered a last-minute endorsement to him.
Mastriano has repeatedly railed against the effort from the state party to endorse a candidate for governor at the fall meeting.
“ I spent 90 minutes with (Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman) Greg Rothman at our house expressing our opposition to an extremely premature endorsement,” Mastriano told WITF in August. “We think it’s a terrible idea and it’ll disenfranchise the grassroots, which we’re part of.”
Mastriano has also said that an endorsement of Garrity would not necessarily deter him from joining the 2026 race.
Rothman told the Capital-Star in an interview in February endorsing candidates early, like the state party did in 2024 for Dave McCormick, can make a “huge difference.”
Garrity echoed a similar sentiment with reporters on Saturday.
“Anytime you can get an early endorsement, it’s fantastic, and I am so honored to have the endorsement and the confidence of the leaders here of our grassroots party,” she said.
Peter Quaglia, a committeeman from Wayne County, noted that Garrity broke the record for most votes earned in an election in state history during her 2024 victory as a reason the party endorsed her.
“I’m personally somebody who’s normally against endorsements, but this is a situation where, not to endorse her would be an abdication of our responsibility to the party,” Quaglia said. “She’s been gift-wrapped for us, basically in terms of somebody to go up against Josh Shapiro.”
Republican state committee members that spoke with the Capital-Star said they were unsure if Mastriano would decide to enter the race. 
How will Trump impact the race?
Garrity and Mastriano are both vocal supporters of President Trump and his administration.
Trump’s endorsements usually hold a lot of weight in GOP primaries in Pennsylvania and beyond.
In 2022, Trump backed Mastriano and Mehmet Oz in their respective primaries for governor and U.S. Senate. Both candidates won the primary, but lost in the general election. 
Trump has not formally announced his support for a candidate in the 2026 Pennsylvania race for governor. 
“I was so honored to campaign with President Trump in 2024 and he and I led the ticket,” Garrity told reporters. “And so I would be honored to get his endorsement.”

“And between now and when I get it, I will be working in all four corners of the great commonwealth to get the endorsement of every voter in Pennsylvania,” she added.
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party is already attempting to link Garrity with Trump in the 2026 race.
“If Stacy Garrity does become the GOP insiders’ pick for governor, they will be making a clear choice: pledging allegiance to a candidate who has pledged her own allegiance to Donald Trump and a dangerous agenda that will hurt the people of Pennsylvania,” DePasquale said. “The voters of the commonwealth know they can’t trust someone like that anywhere near the Governor’s office.”
Trump won the state’s 19 electoral votes in 2024, although recent approval ratings show that the president approval rating dropping in Pennsylvania.
Val Biancaniello, a GOP committeewoman from Delaware County, credited Trump’s message in 2024 for his victory, as well as the GOP’s “Swamp the Vote” strategy, which also encouraged Republicans to vote-by-mail. Although Democrats vote-by-mail in larger numbers, Republicans did increase their share of voting by mail in the 2024 election.
In August, Trump sent out a post on social media that he was going to “lead a movement” to end mail-in voting.
No endorsement for the race for Lt. Gov.
The Pennsylvania Republican Party during Saturday’s meeting decided to push back it’s endorsement in the race for lieutenant governor until their next state committee meeting in 2026.
Garrity declined to say who she wanted to join her on the ticket.
“That process will play out,” Garrity said. “So, we’ll deal with that at the next state committee meeting in February.”

Guy Ciarrocchi, a GOP committeeman in Chester County, believes it is important to have a strong candidate in that race, as well.
“I think the important thing is this last three years has been about showmanship,” he said. “I think Stacy wants to build a ticket where things will get done, where we’ll finally pass budgets on time, where we’ll deal with school choice and empower parents.”

Rand Paul says Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brandon Carr’s criticism of comedian Jimmy Kimmel was “absolutely inappropriate.”
“The FCC was wrong to weigh in. And I’ll fight any — any — attempt by the government to get involved with speech. I will fight,” Paul said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
At the same time, Paul said, “people have to also realize that despicable comments, you have the right to say them, but you don’t have the right to employment.”
 The Kentucky Republican dodged saying anything directly critical of President Donald Trump as host Kristen Welker asked about Trump’s threats to broadcasters’ license over negative coverage of him and the president’s demands over the weekend that Attorney General Pam Bondi criminally prosecute his political enemies.
“I think lawfare in all forms is bad,” said Paul, asserting that Democrats had misused the justice system to unfairly punish Trump when Democrat Joe Biden was president. 
“It’s wrong now. But you have to put it into context also and acknowledge that the king of all lawfare was Biden and the Democrats for four years. What they did to Donald Trump was an abomination. But yes, it is not right for the Trump administration to do the same thing.”
Paul also contended that the Biden administration had engaged in censorship, pressuring social media companies during the pandemic to police content related to COVID-19.
ABC, which is owned by Disney, suspended comedian Kimmel’s late-night show after FCC chairman Carr criticized some of his remarks about the killing of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk and Trump’s response to it. 
Paul said that he and his wife, Kelly Paul, had spoken at Kirk events, including on college campuses. Kirk was debating with students at a college in Utah when he was fatally wounded. 
Paul said that Kirk stood out from “a lot of the argumentation you see either on TV or on the internet where everybody’s drowning people out” because of his willingness to hear opposing points of view. “He actually would listen to people. So I think he’ll be remembered for that and also being remembered for a guy that was trying to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. And that I think should be applauded.”
With the risk of a government shutdown looming at month’s end if the Senate cannot agree on a temporary spending plan, Paul, a deficit hawk, said, “I’m not going to vote for the Republican plan or the Democrat plan. I think eventually they come together. But typically, the compromise is to make things worse. The compromise through the years is the right gets more military spending, the left gets more welfare spending, and the deficit continues to explode.
“Our debt has been downgraded; our triple A rating has been taken away. There is unrest, and I do believe that we face serious problems as a country if we don’t do something so simple as just start spending what comes in. Balance our budget.”
Paul was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against Trump’s tax and spending bill in July.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado, along with 15 other states, is poised to sue the federal government for ignoring endangered species regulations in a wide range of infrastructure projects on public lands. One of those projects, a controversial proposal to expand an oil shipping facility in Utah, would significantly increase hazardous rail shipments through Colorado.
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, and the attorneys general of the other states provided in a July 18 letter to Trump administration officials a 60-day notice of their intent to sue. The notice expired last week.
The letter cites violations of the Endangered Species Act it says have occurred in pursuit of an executive order, called “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” which President Donald Trump signed on his first day in office in January. 
“The ESA and implementing regulations do not allow agencies to routinely avoid and delay implementation of the ESA’s protections of endangered species and their critical habitats in the manner you have directed and which your agencies are carrying out,” the letter says.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter was addressed to Trump, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the directors of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Marine Fisheries Service.
The letter lists pipeline, cable and mining projects in states from Washington to Illinois — including the Wildcat Loadout Facility Right-of-Way Amendment on U.S. Bureau of Land Management land near Price, Utah — that it says pose risks to listed endangered species or critical habitat for fish and aquatic mammals from rainbow trout to salmon to sturgeon to whales.
The letter says Trump’s executive order declaring an energy emergency to fast-track fossil fuel production, despite record oil production in the United States, “unlawfully directs the (Army) Corps and Interior to bypass legal requirements, including those provided in the ESA. Congress did not authorize agencies to routinely bypass the ESA’s requirements to develop the President’s preferred energy sources.”
Asked if by signing onto the pending endangered species lawsuit, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is signaling he intends to join a separate lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s “energy emergency” executive order, a spokesperson for Weiser said that has yet to be determined.
“The notice of intent to sue to enforce the ESA could be a basis for joining the lawsuit challenging the White House energy emergency executive order,” Weiser spokesman Lawrence Pacheco wrote in an email this month. “The attorney general, however, has not made a decision on joining the EO lawsuit.”
Pacheco did not provide additional information on when the endangered species litigation will be filed or how it will be announced.
“We announce all lawsuits that we join or file ourselves,” Pacheco said. “I don’t have any idea on timing.”
Sued by environmental groups
The Wildcat Loadout expansion, as first reported by Newsline in 2023, has been plagued by air quality violations and other matters related to Native American antiquities. It would allow crude oil producers in the Uinta Basin to vastly expand drilling and transportation, including by rail through Colorado. Another proposed project in the basin, the bitterly opposed Uinta Basin Railway, would allow for even greater oil shipments. When the U.S. Supreme Court in late May cleared the way for the 88-mile rail link project, proponents said their next step was “completion of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) process.“
The BLM in early July invoked Trump’s emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of the permit for the Wildcat facility, which could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day. Combined with the expansion of other nearby facilities, it will allow for the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for the Uinta Basin Railway project.
The railway project, estimated to cost at least $2.4 billion to build, would allow for up to 350,000 barrels of oil per day — more than doubling U.S. oil-by-rail transport — to move in heated oil tankers for 100 miles along the headwaters of the Colorado River, under the Continental Divide at Winter Park and through Denver on their way to refineries along the Gulf Coast. Backers of the project are seeking low-interest U.S. Department of Transportation private activity bonds.
Eagle County and five environmental groups sued to overturn U.S. Surface Transportation Board approval of the railway in 2022. They were initially successfully, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a favorable 2023 federal appellate court decision. Eagle County has long sought more direct state involvement in litigation opposing the project.
In a press release following the Supreme Court ruling, Keith Heaton, director of Utah’s Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, which has been using taxpayer dollars to pursue the railway project, said, “It represents a turning point for rural Utah — bringing safer, sustainable, more efficient transportation options, and opening new doors for investment and economic stability. We look forward to continuing our work with all stakeholders to deliver this transformative project.”
The coalition is not a sponsor of the Wildcat Loadout project.
Asked for project updates and comment on the pending endangered species litigation, Melissa Cano, director of communications for the Uinta Basin Railway and the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, replied in an email: “At this time, the coalition does not have additional information or updates to provide beyond what has already been made publicly available. What I do wish to stress is that the Uinta Basin Railway Project is moving forward.”

(Photo by Peter Macdiarmid, Getty Images)Armed with new data that show nearly $1 billion was spent on dental emergency room and hospital charges in 2024, a wide coalition of health care advocates is pushing the Legislature to approve a new mid-level dental health care provider known as dental therapists.
Floridians for Dental Access is an effort led by Dr. Frank Catalanotto and it’s got the blessing of House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, who first sponsored the legislation as a freshman legislator. Past attempts have been quashed by the Florida Senate, which has targeted billions on bolstering the state’s health care workforce in recent years but has been unwilling to sign off on the idea.
Rural counties are some of the hardest hit by dental shortages and cost increases with nearly 41% of Florida’s 32 rural counties reporting a 77% increase in dental-related hospital and emergency room billings.
With Senate President Ben Albritton pushing for hundreds of millions in state dollars for rural Florida’s counties and Perez nearing the end of his two-year leadership in the House, Catalanotto says the 2026 session is go time.
“We kinda feel like it’s now or never. It’s gotta be this year,” Catalanotto, a former dean of the University of Florida College of Dentistry, told the Florida Phoenix.
“I can’t be specific about it, but we are working on several approaches to work with the Florida Senate on it. “

Dental therapists are similar to physician assistants. They can perform preventative and routine dental care, such as filling cavities, placing temporary crowns, or extracting teeth. They work under the supervision of dentists, while leaving the more complicated dental procedures for the dentists.
As of now, no bill has been filed for the 2026 session. But the 2025 language would have required dental therapists to follow several steps: 

Graduate from an accredited dental therapy school.
Complete a dental therapy practical or clinical exam produced by the American Board of Dental Examiners.
Complete at least 24 hours and up to 36 hours of continuing education biennially to maintain licensure.

Dental therapists would have to work under the supervision of a dentist but that could be under general supervision via a collaborative agreement without having the dentist on-site or without the dentist examining the patient first. 
During a CareQuest Institute for Oral Health webinar on dental therapy, panelists testified that dental therapists make about one-third to one-half of what dentists earn. CareQuest is a nonprofit “championing a more equitable future where every person can reach their full potential through excellent health.”
 Florida’s got an access problem
The latest available federal Health Resources and Services Administration data show an additional 10,143 dental practitioners are needed nationwide to address the dental health professional shortage. The agency supports programs like scholarships, loan repayment, and training to bolster skilled health workforces in underserved areas.
In Florida the problem is particularly acute. 
The state needs 1,259 additional dental providers to care for the nearly 6 million people lacking dental access. Dental health professional shortage areas means there’s a population-to-provider ratio of at least 5,000 to 1. 
American Dental Association data demonstrate Florida’s lack of dentists. While the overall dentist-to-100,000 population ratio in the U.S. was 59.5 in 2024, it was 52.4 in Florida. The ADA 2025 report shows that in Florida just 25.6% of the dentists participate in Medicaid, below all neighboring states.
An inside look at the numbers
The WellFlorida Health Planning Council — the private, nonprofit organization and state-designated local health council for 16 counties in North Central Florida — and Floridians for Dental Access have distributed data that show about 146,000 people went to the hospital or emergency department for dental care in 2024 and hospitals billed nearly $1 billion.
“These people are suffering and we as a society are paying for it. What I could have done with $1 billion and a dental therapist would have been unbelievable,” Catalanotto said.
More than 20% of the 2024 tab was billed to Medicaid, the taxpayer-supported health care safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled. “No pay” accounted for another 17% ($167.3 million) of the 2024 dental-related billings.
At nearly $1 billion, the 2024 costs represented a 77% increase in hospital billings since the group started tracking the data in 2021.
Between 2021 and 2024, dental costs went up for nearly all 32 rural counties across the state. Only Liberty and Glades counties saw decreases in their hospital-related dental costs during that time. 
Conversely, there was a 592% increase in hospital-related dental in Madison County even though the number of patients increased by about 23%.
Mum’s the word
The Florida Dental Association did not respond to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment for this story.
The FDA has long opposed any effort to authorize dental therapists. In testimony before the Health Professions & Programs Subcommittee earlier this year, FDA chief legislative officer Joe Ann Hart insisted dental therapists wouldn’t improve public health. Authorizing dental therapists, she said, would allow someone “right out of high school with three years of dental therapy training to perform irreversible procedures such as extractions and administer local anesthesia.”
Catalanotto conceded the FDA, which he once belonged to, has a “wonderful lobbying system,” and a strong PAC.
“Everyone of these legislators has a dentist. And they can get their ear. And they can tell them stories,” Catalanotto laments.
The American Children’s Campaign is another proponent of dental therapy. Its president, Roy Miller, criticized the FDA for its pushback against dental therapy, saying in a prepared statement that it “ignores the soaring pain and suffering and doesn’t make any sense.”
“Dental therapists must pass the exact same licensing exam as dentists for the procedures they perform. They would be supervised by dentists. And it would be voluntary on whether a dentist would add them to their practice, as well. There are many dentists in Florida who support dental therapy, and the FDA certainly doesn’t speak for them.”

(Adam Thury/Mitchell Republic)One of South Dakota’s wealthiest businessmen says an aspect of economic development often gets overlooked — great public schools.
“If families know their children can get a top-quality education in Mitchell, that makes us more attractive than bigger, busier places,” said Roger Musick, who started and sold the telecommunications and software company, Innovative Systems.  
In mid-August, Musick devoted $33 million to education in his hometown of about 15,000 people. That includes a $15 million endowment for Mitchell Public Schools, another $15 million for Dakota Wesleyan University, and $3 million to get program expansions rolling immediately without waiting for the endowment to collect interest. 
Bank of America will invest the money. The endowment will earn about 7% annually. Five percent will support programs each year. Two percent will be reinvested to grow the account. 
A five-member board will oversee the programs. Members include Mitchell’s superintendent, the school board president, one board appointee, Dakota Wesleyan’s president and Musick.
Working parents
Musick has brought a lot of workers to Mitchell over his decades in business. He said it wasn’t the Corn Palace, the lake or the city’s events that convinced applicants to move. What they wanted was a quality education system for their kids and a safe place to leave them during the workday. 
So one of the projects expands Mitchell’s “Begindergarten” program. The class serves children old enough for kindergarten who are not quite ready socially or academically. 
The state funds only a half-day Begindergarten program, which limited access for working parents, Musick explained. The endowment expands Mitchell’s program to allow for full-day classes.










I want to live in a society where everybody is well educated, not just the people that can afford it. I have nothing against private education, but it will typically only be available to people who can afford it. Public education is what we have to have.


– Roger Musick


Musick said enrollment has already risen 80%, and the goal is to make it so that parents do not have to choose between waiting another year or sending their child unprepared.
After-school programs are also a priority. With the new funding, each public elementary school is hosting its own after-school program, staffed by certified teachers and aides, so parents no longer need to arrange rides to off-site locations.
“Some kids have great support at home to get their homework done. Some don’t,” Musick said. “This way, every child gets that help, and they also get experiences they might never have had otherwise.”
Students complete homework, receive tutoring, and participate in activities like sports and the arts.
“I hope this becomes a really good workforce recruitment tool,” Musick said.
Tressa Wede, director of education and community engagement at Dakota Wesleyan in Mitchell, said demand is high. She said at L.B. Williams Elementary, where she previously taught, about 140 students are already taking advantage of the after-school program. 
“The reception has been phenomenal,” she said.

At the university, the endowment will pay for teaching scholarships — encouraging more students to pursue careers as educators. Additionally, the fund will pay for Mitchell teachers to pursue their master’s degree. Musick said that’s all because teachers in South Dakota struggle with low salaries, discouraging people from pursuing the profession. The state ranks 46th nationally for teacher pay.
“Our teachers are far more valuable than that, and we need more emphasis there,” Musick said.
Wede said the initiative is making Mitchell’s teachers feel valued and she expects more aspiring educators to choose the community to call home. The master’s degree program requires scholarship recipients to teach in Mitchell for three years.
“This is probably the most exciting time I have experienced as a teacher,” she said. “We go into this because we want to make a positive difference, and here we are being supported in doing that.”
A belief in public education
The public school funding boost in Mitchell comes amid statewide ideological and political battles over education. 
Republican lawmakers in Pierre are weighing reallocating more public school funding toward alternatives such as homeschooling or vouchers. Some have leveled allegations that public school teachers are indoctrinating children and passed a bill to “protect students” from “divisive concepts.” They debated legislation during the last session requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted and taught in public school classrooms statewide. The bill narrowly failed in the House after passing the Senate.
Musick attended Mitchell’s schools and sent his children there. He said public education remains essential and deserves more focus and respect.
“I want to live in a society where everybody is well educated, not just the people that can afford it,” Musick said. “I have nothing against private education, but it will typically only be available to people who can afford it. Public education is what we have to have.”
Musick said he will track progress through the district’s report card and feedback from teachers. He hopes the project inspires other communities and state leaders to put more focus on public education.
“If you look at countries where people are happiest, like Norway and Denmark, education is really valued. Teachers are paid well and thought of highly,” Musick said. “That’s the kind of culture we need here.”
But even if Mitchell’s population never grows beyond 15,000, Musick said the gift will still have been worth it, because “we’ll have a lot of people who are smarter and more successful because of this focus on education.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-09-21 13:58:53+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,I don’t want to close any more mental health centers,Christopher Tuttle,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/i-dont-want-to-close-any-more-mental-health-centers/,The cost of operating our clinic with optimal staffing simply exceeded by a wide margin the amount we received from insurers – largely the state Medicaid program MassHealth – to operate it.,"LATE LAST YEAR, I made the hard decision to close a mental health center in Lynn, an area where more access to care is needed, not less. The cost of operating this clinic with optimal staffing simply exceeded by a wide margin the amount we received from insurers – largely the state Medicaid program MassHealth – to operate it.  
While my organization, Bridgewell, is both mission-driven and nonprofit, we can’t operate programs where the resources do not exist to support those programs. 
There is, however, a solution. Current legislation on Beacon Hill would permanently fix this funding gap, by boosting Medicaid rates for community mental health services and reviewing those rates every two years to ensure that the rates stay ahead of the cost of delivering the care. 
Mental health centers play an invaluable role at a time when behavioral health needs are surging, particularly among children who are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic while coping with pressures like cyber-bullying that did not exist when I was growing up.  
People seen at mental health centers have diagnoses including anxiety, PTSD, suicidal ideation and attempts, sexual and physical trauma, and significant substance use complexity. These centers provide individual and group therapy and are particularly adept at involving the entire family to devise solutions that can help patients recover.  
Mental health centers help create healthy communities. 
In addition to serving the needs of individuals, mental health centers also play an indispensable role in training clinicians. When mental health centers close, the Commonwealth loses training capacity for mental health practitioners. The irony is that many people complete their training at a mental health center and move on to private practice, where they can earn enough to repay their student loans. 
Across our organization, we currently have 15 open clinical positions. It takes between six and nine months to fill these positions. Our leadership team is being pulled away from their day-to-day job to fill the gaps created by these vacancies.  
We serve about 5,000 individuals at the three remaining clinics we now operate and often have wait times of up to four months for an initial consultation. Despite this strong demand, our outpatient clinics are losing millions of dollars.  
The rates paid by MassHealth – which covers some two million patients across Massachusetts – simply aren’t enough to fully cover the cost of clinician salaries, administrative operations, and other expenses that are all essential to providing these highly valuable services. Many private medical practitioners have stopped accepting any insurance payments and instead charge fees that low- and moderate-income individuals cannot afford. Our clinics are here to serve those who have no other place to go to get the care they need. 
After the Lynn closure, Bridgewell now operates three mental health centers — in Lowell, Amesbury, and Danvers. Our Lowell and Amesbury clinics provide a full range of services for both adults and children. Our Danvers clinic is one of only two in the Commonwealth that serves adults with both intellectual and developmental disabilities and a co-occurring mental health diagnosis. 
The Lynn clinic faithfully served the community for more than two decades. Its closure was not due to a lack of need, but unsustainable financial loss at the hands of low reimbursement rates from MassHealth.  
S.874 and H.1396 would require MassHealth, specifically, to implement a 5 percent rate increase for all outpatient behavioral health services. It would also ensure that rates paid to mental health centers are no less than 20 percent higher than comparable behavioral health services delivered in private practices. Current rates do not adjust for the cost of the additional staffing, training, and programmatic requirements placed on mental health centers. 
Rather than systematically close sites, stagnant MassHealth rates may force Bridgewell to exit outpatient mental health altogether. Such an idea would have been almost unthinkable only a few years ago. Our organization grew up out of the community mental health movement. I expect other organizations could be confronted with the same challenge. 
Mental health needs are soaring. Thankfully, Massachusetts has demonstrated true leadership with the launch of the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform, which created a new “front door” for the state’s residents to access mental health and substance use services. 
But without a permanent fix to the reimbursement rate gap, we’ll continue losing ground in the quest to ensure access to vital mental health services for all. Let’s finish the job.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Board of Nursing has sanctioned several licensed nurses for clinical errors, patient-privacy violations, theft of patient medications, and other issues.
Among the cases is that of Diane Tegtmeyer, 58, who has been sanctioned by the board on at least four occasions.
Board records indicate Tegtmeyer was charged in May 2025 with failing to assess or evaluate the status of a patient, and with committing an act that may adversely affect a patient’s welfare.
The board alleged Tegtmeyer committed “medication errors” by documenting, on multiple occasions, that she had administered medication to residents of a care facility although video footage confirmed she did not enter those residents’ rooms.
The case was settled with Tegtmeyer agreeing to having her license placed in probation for 36 months during which time she will be subject to monitoring of her practice.
Tegtmeyer has faced disciplinary charges from the board on at least three prior occasions.
In 2005, Tegtmeyer, then known as Diane Teske, was accused of falsely charting that she had given residents of a care facility their medication while instead placing “the medication in the garbage.” The board ordered Tegtmeyer to complete 30 hours of training on ethics.
In 2007, the board alleged Tegtmeyer was fired by her employer for taking the credit card of an associate and using it to make purchases at Walmart. She later pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card forgery, according to board records. The board fined Tegtmeyer $50 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training in ethics.
In 2015, the Board of Nursing alleged Tegtmeyer failed to report a 2012 criminal conviction for tampering with records  and charged her with knowingly making misleading or untrue statement related to her credentials or licensure status. The board also alleged she falsified records related to the submission of a urine sample for lab testing. In resolving the case, the board fined Tegtmeyer $500 and ordered her to complete an additional 30 hours of training on ethics.
Other Iowa-licensed nurses sanctioned by the board include:
— Nancy Buttry, 53, who has agreed to surrender her nursing license. According to court records, Buttry was living in Harlan in 2023 and working for the Heritage House Senior Living facility in Atlantic. In April 2024, the board charged her with excessive use of drugs in a manner that might impair a licensee’s ability to practice nursing with reasonable skill and safety.
In July 2024, the board dismissed the charges and Buttry was enrolled in the Iowa Professional Health Committee program that assists nurses with substance abuse issues.
Also in 2024, the board initiated a separate investigation into Buttry and, in January 2025, it charged Buttry with violating her contract with the committee. According to the board, Buttry had “not engaged in any of the Iowa Professional Health Committee’s requirements and was not in regular contact with the program” and had not participated in extended outpatient treatment.
Rather than contest the allegations, Buttry agreed to surrender her license.
— Lauren Haldin, who was charged by the board in April with misappropriating medications, property, supplies, or equipment of patients or a clinic; failing to properly safeguard or secure medications as required; and failing to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client.
The offenses allegedly occurred while Haldin was working as a registered nurse at a Des Moines area behavioral health hospital in 2024. The board alleges the hospital fired Haldin after concluding she had stolen controlled substances. According to the board, surveillance video and medication records indicate that on multiple occasions, Haldin  pulled the drugs from the hospital’s supply and then failed to document the drugs as being administered to patients.
Haldin recently agreed to a settlement that calls for her license to be placed on probation for two years. The agreement also calls for her to complete a substance abuse evaluation, enroll in a chemical-screening program, and complete 16 hours of educational training on medication safety and nursing documentation.
— Cynthia Bustos, who was charged in April 2025 with failure to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client, and with misappropriating medications, property, supplies, or equipment of patients or a clinic.
The board alleged the violations occurred while Bustos was practicing in Allison and that she had been suspended from employment “at a rehabilitation facility.” According to the board, that facility’s records indicate Bustos claimed, on seven occasions in September 2024, that she had administered hydrocodone to patients, although the “hydrocodone card and narcotics count sheet” could not be located.
To settle the case, Bustos agreed to have her license placed on probation for one year and to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
In 2022, the board charged Bustos with failing to assess and evaluate the status of a patient or client while employed in home care. According to the board, “multiple clients” had claimed that Bustos had not visited them and provided care on the dates she claimed to have been there. To resolve that case, Bustos agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on medical documentation.
— Sherley Beaufils, who in recent years has been licensed to work as a nurse in Iowa and 45 other states. Beaufils recently agreed recently to surrender her license – an action that comes three and a half years after she was convicted of five counts of health care fraud, one count of conspiracy, five counts of aggravated identity theft and five counts of making false statements related to health care matters. As a result of the criminal convictions, the board alleges, Beaufils was sentenced to 87 months in prison and ordered to pay $1.6 million in restitution.
— Tonya Zimmerman, who was charged by the board with leaving a nursing assignment without ensuring the safety and welfare of her patients, and failing to assess and evaluate a patient.
The board alleged that while employed at Angels Care Home Health from October 2023 to April 2024, Zimmerman “fraudulently charted and abandoned her patients without a valid notice” to her employer. She was also accused of failing to see seven patients who were on her schedule, two of whom required wound care, and of documenting that she had visited patients at times when her computer tablet was known to be at her own residence.
Zimmerman was fired by Angels Care Home Health, according to the board. To resolve the board’s disciplinary charges, Zimmerman recently agreed to complete 30 hours of educational training on ethics.
— Debra Wolterman, who was charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient’s welfare, violating the confidentiality or privacy rights of patients, and engaging in behavior that is contradictory to professional decorum.
The board alleged that at some unspecified time in the past, the hospital where Wolterman worked fired her after it determined she had repeatedly accessed patients’ records for no work purpose and without the patients’ consent. The patients included several of Wolterman’s co-workers at the hospital.
To resolve the case, Wolterman agreed to receive a warning and to complete 30 hours of educational training on patient privacy.
— Pamela Rosendahl, who was charged by the board with failing to properly document an assessment or evaluation of a patient, and with engaging in unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public by participating in a sexual, emotional, social, or business relationship with a patient.
The board alleged that Rosendahl worked as an nurse at Advanced Correctional Health and was assigned to an unspecified county jail from about October 2023 to April 2024. The board alleged she crossed professional boundaries by developing an inappropriate relationship with an inmate to whom she passed out candy in violation of jail policy.
The board alleges that jail records also show two inmates called Rosendahl on her personal phone 11 times, and that she failed to document treatment she provided to one inmate on about 30 separate occasions.
To settle the case, the board agreed to issue Rosendahl a warning and to require that she complete 25 hours of educational training on documentation, ethics, and appropriate boundaries with patients.
— Patricia Jean Stanley, 64, of Des Moines, who recently agreed to surrender her license after being criminally charged with the financial exploitation of an older individual.
According to the board, Stanley pleaded guilty to the charge in February 2025, admitting that she took money from the retirement account of an older person who was not able to consent to the exchange. Stanley was sentenced to a prison term of no more than five years.
Court records indicate Stanley took more than $5,900 from the 88-year-old victim, identified in the records as a relative of Stanley’s. The court records show that previously, while working at Des Moines’ Broadlawns Medical Center in 2023, Stanley was charged with, and later convicted of, theft for her handling of the relative’s finances.

This story by  Tom McKone was first published by The Montpelier Bridge on Sept. 17.
Almost two dozen terra cotta and stoneware clay faces emerge from the surface, top to bottom, starting small and gradually increasing to full heads, creating the illusion they are coming into the room from the past. 
These are the faces of struggling people. Life’s hard for so many around the world today, as it was for all ancestors, I think, as I look at Burlington artist Susan Wilson’s “Becoming I,” at the opening of “Holding: Mementos Kept, Memories Kindled,” this year’s Art at the Kent exhibit at Kents Corner in Calais.
“As I work clay over, my simplified head forms — the faces of those who inspire me — emerge,” she writes. “I travel with those who are searching, yearning, asking questions, and struggling to move forward in their lives.”
Wilson’s works evoke the past, our shared and personal memories and our shared humanity — themes developed by the 22 Vermont artists in the Kent exhibit.
As visitors start their journey in the rambling, nearly two-century-old building, they walk through a hallway with 39 portraits.
“We wanted to show the breadth of humanity on this wall,” says Cornelia “Nel” Emlen, one of three curators. “We all have our own stories that we’re holding.”
Curator Allyson Evans calls the wall a “human container … emblematic of every person.”
Twelve of those works are exquisite portraits by Middlesex artist August Burns, who has two additional portraits in other parts of the exhibit. Burns, who painted the official portrait of Gov. Howard Dean, is one of two artists in this show who have painted official portraits of former Vermont governors. Middlebury artist Kate Gridley painted Gov. Jim Douglas’ portrait.
David Schutz, the third curator, says when they met with artists and developed the theme for this year’s exhibit, talking with Gridley convinced them to focus on memory. They gave her a room for 58 small paintings, in which she painted objects from her earliest memories, more or less chronologically, through her life.
In a brochure accompanying her installation, Gridley writes that years ago, when her very smart, aging father began experiencing dementia, he “amassed an enormous library of neurology books,” and the brain and memory became a regular part of their conversations.
“As daughter, I was losing him. As artist, I wanted to find a way to embody the explorations about memory that we had been sharing,” Gridley writes.
Burlington artist Jennifer Koch’s installation, “Specimens,” is distributed through the show and includes plenty of found objects. In an extraordinary series of shadow boxes, Koch starts with classic European paintings, then constructs an outrageous, three-dimensional headdress out of incongruous objects, from musical instruments and kitchen utensils to paint brushes, trophies and parts of toys. At first, the shadow boxes are just interesting, then they become addictive.
“Gratitude in a Time of Loss,” East Montpelier artist Daryl Burtnett’s installation about Covid-19, which was shown in the Vermont Supreme Court Gallery last fall, is the first art to ever be given a room on the museum’s third floor. The hundreds of small pieces, each acknowledging a Vermont life lost to the epidemic, are now in a different configuration from the previous show.
Juliana Jennings, co-owner of J. Langdon’s antique shop in Montpelier, has filled a space the size of a walk-in closet with hundreds of old items from her home — not from the store.
Self-trained Barre folk artist Gayleen Aiken (1934-2005) is featured in the self-contained Spotlight Gallery. With crayon, pen, pencil, and oil paints, Aiken created paintings, drawings, and cardboard cut-outs. Her works are in the permanent collections of several large museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.
The monthlong exhibit opened Sept. 12 and runs every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., through Oct. 12. In addition to Words Out Loud, there are several special events during the month, all described at kentscorner.org.
With beautiful weather, live music, and catered food, the opening celebration on Sept. 13 attracted several hundred visitors. The closing celebration will be held on Oct. 12, from 3 to 5 p.m.

If we allow ourselves to stop listening to one another, if we refuse to find common ground, then the very freedoms we cherish are at risk of slipping away.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Joe Major: The importance of civil discourse in Vermont and nationwide.","Dear Editor,
The recent fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk is a stark and tragic reminder of just how fragile our democracy and our civil society can be when disagreements cross the line into violence. 
Let me be clear: I fundamentally reject much of the rhetoric Kirk stood for. His words often carried racism, homophobia and misogyny that do real harm in communities across this country. But the test of our democracy is not whether we defend speech we agree with. The test is whether we defend the right to speak for those we most vehemently oppose.
As a public servant, I will always fight for that principle. The First Amendment must apply to everyone, or it means nothing at all.
Here in Vermont, I’m grateful that our politics remain rooted in civility, even when we disagree. Republicans and Democrats in our Statehouse debate with passion, and we certainly don’t see eye to eye on every issue — but the tone of those debates is grounded in mutual respect. At the end of the day, we share the same mission: to do what is best for Vermonters. That spirit of collaboration has allowed me to work across the aisle on meaningful legislation.
With Sen. Robert Norris, R-Franklin, I’ve served on the Judicial Nominating Board to select fair and qualified candidates for our Supreme Court. With Sen. Randy Brock, R-Franklin, I helped pass a significant tax break for military retirees and survivors, exempting their benefits from state income tax. With Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, though we often hold views that are worlds apart, I’ve been proud to serve as vice chair to the Senate Agriculture Committee that he chairs. 
In my first year, he was a mentor, ensuring the committee stayed focused on helping Vermont’s farmers above all else.
This is the Vermont way: respectful discourse, shared responsibility and compromise where possible. But I recognize that this way of governing is not guaranteed. It is tenuous, and it must be protected. 
If we allow ourselves to stop listening to one another, if we refuse to find common ground, then the very freedoms we cherish — the right to speak, to disagree and to live in peace despite our differences — are at risk of slipping away. 
That is why I will continue to fight for both the right to speak freely and the responsibility to do so civilly. Our democracy depends on it.
Sen. Joe Major, D-WindsorHartford

By Ryan Colasant    This season was bound to bring many firsts for the University of Delaware as they transitioned into FBS football. This game against Florida International University ensured more first time occurrences as the Fightin’ Blue Hens took on their first conference foe in the two programs first ever meeting.
In a season filled with first time milestones, UD introduced itself to Conference USA in a big way defeating the FIU Panthers on the road, 38-16, Saturday evening.
The Blue Hens started the game with a field goal on their opening possession. The Panthers retaliated with a promising drive that landed them at UD’s ten yard line. Panther quarterback Keyone Jenkins dropped back on third down and looked right searching for a receiver to come open in the endzone. Jenkins thought he found an open target and fired a pass that landed in the blue gloves of Delaware safety Mysonne Pollard.
Pollard’s interception stalled FIU’s momentum, but didn’t result in points for the Blue Hen offense. UD was forced to punt the ball away on its ensuing offensive possession. The Panthers started the next drive on their own 46-yard line and three plays later held a 7-3 advantage over the newcomers.
The scoring stalled there. The UD defense didn’t allow a single point the rest of the half and allowed the Blue Hen offense to take control of the game in the second quarter outscoring the Panthers, 21-0.
Their first score of the frame followed Pollard’s second interception of the half, turning the ball over to the offense at their own 45-yard line. Running back Jo Silver capitalized on Pollard’s first-ever two-interception game with a 14-yard touchdown run, returning the lead to UD.
On the next drive, Blue Hen quarterback Nick Minicucci connected with graduate receiver Nick Laboy in the back right of the endzone for a two yard score increasing their lead to ten.
UD’s defense forced a three and out on FIU’s next possession and the Panthers punted the ball to Kyre Duplessis. Duplessis caught the punt and shed a couple of arm tackles blazing through the middle of field before settling down the left sideline. The Coastal Carolina transfer followed his career day against UConn with another career milestone completing a 68-yard punt return with a trip to the endzone.
FIU tried to score before halftime but a key sack from graduate student Dillon Trainer on third down forced the Panthers to try a field goal as the clock dwindled down. The Panthers got the kick off just in time, but it fell wide right.
The Blue Hens held all the momentum from there and never let up, scoring two more touchdowns in the second half courtesy of a couple Minicucci touchdown throws to Laboy and Viron Ellison Jr.
The Blue Hen offense finished the game with over 350 yards of total offense and just one turnover. Manicucci threw for 218 yards and three touchdowns to go along with one interception. Laboy finished with just two catches, but both were touchdown grabs setting a new career high for touchdown catches in a game.
UD played a clean game compared to FIU only committing two penalties against FIU’s seven. The defense compiled five tackles for loss, two turnovers and held CUSA’s fourth highest scoring offense to just 16 points.
The Blue Hens sit atop the conference standings after the win and hold claim to the conference’s second best scoring offense.
The Blue Hens next game will be on October 3 against the conference’s top scoring offense of Western Kentucky University.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/b386fe75-7647-4917-970b-cc0a63ae9a0e.png,,,2025-09-21 08:56:52.237663

Many northerners were outraged that the law compelled them, under threat of a prison sentence or stiff fine, to work in support of slavery.

Image via the Brooklyn Museum
History is littered with unintended consequences. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 is a prime example. Envisioned by Congress as a way to ease tensions between the North and South over the brutally painful issue of slavery, the law served only to inflame regional resentments.
Many northerners were outraged that the law compelled them, under threat of a prison sentence or stiff fine, to work in support of slavery. Specifically, the law required state and local officials to assist the federal marshals who were tasked with capturing and returning people who had escaped slavery. Ordinary citizens could also be charged with a crime if they appeared to “knowingly and willingly obstruct, hinder, or prevent” the seizure of formerly enslaved people.
Just how badly Congress miscalculated when it passed the law became clear in Vermont, where the state government instituted its own new statute that made the federal law virtually impossible to enforce. In doing so, Vermont lawmakers argued that abiding by the Fugitive Slave Law would violate both the state and federal constitutions. 
The Fugitive Slave Law was part of a series of measures that together became known as the Compromise of 1850. The laws were an attempt to balance the interests of the free and slave states in resolving issues arising from the Mexican-American War. Victory had brought vast new territories under American control, so Congress needed to decide whether any new states being created would allow slavery.
Hammered out by Whig Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky and Vermont-born Democratic Sen. Stephen Douglas, who represented Illinois, the compromise admitted California as a free state and banned slavery in Washington, D.C. In return, Congress declared that settlers in Utah and New Mexico could decide whether those territories would permit slavery. In late September, Congress also passed the Fugitive Slave Law, which constituted a major strengthening of existing laws.
The Burlington Free Press responded to the Fugitive Slave Law with an extraordinary editorial. Ostensibly writing to formerly enslaved people who were seeking freedom, the newspaper declared: “We think a good deal more of the Slave who has the spirit to attempt to assert his ‘inalienable right’ to personal liberty, than we do of the white man who would deprive him of that right.”
“KEEP OUT OF THE CITIES,” the Free Press advised. “Morality and Humanity are dead among City officials. Where men congregate together in great herds, the vicious and inhuman altogether predominate over the just and humane.” Cities breed greed, the editorial argued, and their populations “care very little about freedom.”
Instead, the Free Press suggested Vermont as a destination: “Go into the uncontaminated COUNTRY. Seek our quiet Villages, where the Mountains and the Valleys and the Streams and the Air, are the Evangelists of Freedom. Go into an atmosphere that Slave-Catchers cannot breathe and live — where Habeas Corpus and Trial by Jury are substantial realities, and will not be surrendered till the Constitution authoritatively demands the sacrifice. Don’t stop among the many, but among the few. Come to Vermont….”
The Free Press editor was building on Vermont’s reputation as an opponent of slavery. In 1777, the state had become the first state to ban slavery in its Constitution. That prohibition, however, came with a significant asterisk — it did not apply to males under the age of 21 or females under 18. Also, there was no enforcement mechanism, so incidents of people being enslaved in Vermont continued into at least the first decade of the 1800s. In 1835, mobs in Rutland and Montpelier disrupted antislavery speeches by a touring minister. Vermont’s record was hardly unblemished.
But much had changed in Vermont during the decade and a half leading up to 1850. Antislavery speakers and writers had persuaded some Vermonters to change their views. More importantly, the war with Mexico offered tangible proof that, left unchecked, slavery would likely spread. The massive territories that came with the American victory threatened to bring perhaps five new slave states into the Union. Some Vermonters tolerated slavery where it had already taken root, but they were deeply uncomfortable with allowing it to grow.
In the weeks after the Fugitive Slave Law’s passage, Vermonters gathered at meetings around the state to denounce it. The Brandon Post listed six meetings in Rutland County alone (Brandon, Rutland, Wallingford, Castleton, Poultney and Benson).
The Friends of Liberty of Chittenden and Addison counties advertised an “Indignation Meeting” to be held in North Ferrisburgh to protest the law, which had made Vermont a “Slave Hunting ground and our citizens Human Blood Hounds.”
The Burlington Courier published an article headlined “How To Oppose the Fugitive Slave Law,” which argued against violence, rebellion and mob rule, “(a)nd yet we mean resolutely to oppose the (law), and to use all our influence to prevent its execution.”  
While arguing for the law’s repeal, the St. Albans Messenger tried to calm people’s passions. “We hope that Vermont will express none of this fanatical law-breaking disposition which is too manifest in many places out of the state,” it wrote. “Ultraism and fanaticism of every kind is now glutting itself on the excitement in reference to this bill.” The newspaper urged Vermonters not to “imitate this worst feature of southern manners, and resort to nullification and anarchy.”  
Vermont Gov. Charles Kilborn Williams, an ardent abolitionist who once declared that any law supporting slavery was “unchristian” and “violates the right of nature,” helped push a bill through the state Legislature that made the Fugitive Slave Law effectively unenforceable in Vermont. 
The statute became known as the Habeas Corpus Law, after the legal procedure under which courts review whether a person is being detained or imprisoned legally. Under the new law, Vermont state’s attorneys of each county had to bring any alleged fugitive before a judge. If the judge failed to release the accused, the defendant had the right to a trial by jury, with the state covering the costs. Given public sympathies, Vermont juries would have inevitably ruled against the enslavers.
The law put Vermont at the forefront of the fight. No other state passed a new personal liberty law between 1850 and 1853, though some Northern states followed suit after that time.  
Vermont’s law faced harsh criticism. Editors of the Daily National Intelligencer, a newspaper in Washington, D.C., that advocated gradual emancipation, wrote: “We are mortified and astonished that such an enactment should not only have received the concurrence of the Legislature, but the sanction of the Governor.”
President Millard Fillmore was outraged with Williams and the Vermont Legislature. “(T)he president and the entire Cabinet are very much exasperated at the course of proceedings in the Vermont legislature,” reported the Memphis Daily Eagle, “and … they determined to enforce the fugitive slave law in Vermont, should a case arise there, if it required the whole military force of the United States to do it.”  
Opponents of the Vermont law criticized the state for engaging in “nullification,” the claim that individual states have the right to ignore federal laws they believe are unconstitutional. Two decades earlier, South Carolina lawmakers had famously attempted to nullify federal tariffs they said promoted Northern interests over Southern ones.
Supporters of the Vermont law, however, argued that the state statute was more constitutional than the federal one because habeas corpus and its guarantee of due process are enshrined in both the U.S. and Vermont constitutions.
The Natchez Democrat newspaper in Mississippi saw things differently. “This law is clearly and palpably unconstitutional, and ought to be and will be kicked out of every court in Vermont, unless the person sitting upon the bench is either a knave or a fool,” the paper opined. The newspaper said the law had been “smuggled through” the Vermont Legislature late in the session, when many lawmakers were absent “and the rest (charity would suppose) were drunk.”

In Memphis, Tennessee, the Daily Eagle saw Vermont’s effective blocking of federal law as dangerous. “A government that is not able to enforce its own laws is in reality no government at all. It is a shallow humbug, a misty form, a legal mockery; and should be done away with as speedily as possible,” the paper argued.
The editor of the Georgia Journal and Messenger informed readers that “the acts of the Vermont Legislature will be everywhere regarded in the South as a dangerous aggression.” Still, despite what the writer termed Vermont’s “treasonable propensities,” he wasn’t concerned. “Happily the State is so utterly insignificant in numbers, wealth, and influence that her efforts to sever the bonds which hold us together need excite no other feeling than that of contempt.”
The Argus of Albany, New York, however, saw Vermont’s action as a dangerous escalation of tensions. “Vermont has begun the work — South Carolina may follow,” the paper wrote. “What state will next step into the arena, and nullify another part of the constitution? If this work is to go on, where will the end be? What will become of the constitution or law, or of the Union itself?”
Indeed, a decade later, South Carolina took the ultimate step of nullification when it became the first state to secede from the Union.

It’s a reminder that while Michigan has made real progress against opioid overdoses, the crisis is far from over. We have to keep going.
As an anesthesiologist, a physician specializing in anesthesia, I work with some of the most powerful pain-relieving medications available. In the operating room, drugs like fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone are invaluable. At the right doses, these opioids relieve pain and ease anxiety. I have seen how these drugs can also slow breathing, drop blood pressure, or stop a heart.
That’s why anesthesiologists train for years to balance benefit and risk, adjusting every dose to the age, health and history of the patient we care for, even any previous opioid use. We also use nerve blocks and non-opioid medicines to minimize the amount of opioid given. In healthcare, opioid delivery is anything but “one size fits all.”
Outside healthcare settings, the picture is different. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is has become widespread — cheap to produce, far stronger than heroin and often hidden in counterfeit pills or powders. I’ve spoken with families who lost loved ones after unknowingly taking one of these pills. With fentanyl, overdoses can happen so quickly that emergency help may not arrive in time.
That’s why naloxone, the medication that can reverse an overdose, is so critical. Michigan has taken major steps to expand access through pharmacies, community nonprofits and even vending machines. Insurance companies often cover it, and hospitals send kits home with patients who may be at risk of overdose. Naloxone is a proven, non-addictive rescue medication that reverses overdoses and saves lives.
Our work isn’t done. We need to make sure every community, every school, and every family that wants naloxone can get it easily.
Through the Overdose Prevention Engagement Network, my colleagues and I are working to make opioid prescribing safer, educate communities and help Michigan continue leading the way in reducing overdoses. We’re proud of the partnerships we’ve built with the state to distribute naloxone widely. Sustaining and expanding these efforts will take ongoing support from policymakers, health professionals, families, schools and faith groups alike.
On this National Opioid Awareness Day, I hope people will remember two truths: opioids can be a vital tool when given by trained specialists, like anesthesiologists, and they can be deadly when obtained illicitly or used without medical supervision. If you or someone you love is at risk, make sure naloxone is nearby. And if you’re experiencing challenges with opioids or are concerned about opioid use disorder, you can find help by visiting Michigan’s Substance Use Disorder Services & Programs Dashboard.
Michigan has shown national leadership in overdose prevention, yet our work continues. Now we must keep acting to sustain that leadership — to protect our neighbors, preserve live, and build a future where pain is relieved safely and overdoses are no longer a leading cause of death.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-21 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Could Roger Wicker be part of another rare bipartisan health plan in U.S. Congress?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/21/roger-wicker-broger-wicker-bipartisan-health/,Roger Wicker helped pass a key bipartisan health program in 1997 that helped poor Mississippi families. Will he do something similar in 2025?,"There is a chance that a rare case — not a pandemic but a single occurrence of bipartisanship on a health care issue — could break out in the U.S. Congress before the end of the year.
Such cases are few and far between, but national press reports indicate that the Republican-controlled Congress, fearing the backlash in the 2026 midterm elections, is pondering extending the program that provides enhanced federal financial assistance to people purchasing health insurance policies through the Affordable Care Act exchanges.
If the enhanced subsidies expire at the end of 2025 as scheduled, it would create a substantial increase in cost for the millions of Americans who get their health insurance coverage through the marketplace exchange — a key component of former President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
During the administration of former President Joe Biden, Democrats increased the federal subsidies provided to help people pay for the ACA exchange policies. No Republican voted for the enhanced federal subsidies just as they did not vote for the ACA in 2010.
But now fearing a backlash in the 2026 midterm elections, some are reportedly trying to find a way to extend the enhanced subsidies for at least another year. 
If the federal financial assistance for the cost of the marketplace policies expires, Mississippi will be hit particularly hard.
Unless Congress acts before the end of the year, the price of the marketplace’s health insurance policies will increase an estimated $480 annually in Mississippi, according to KFF, a national group that conducts health care research. The subsidies are provided based on income levels, so the costs for some could be much higher next year if the enhanced assistance expires at the end of 2025.
Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF. Only Texas has seen a greater increase at 255%.
Many of the Republicans who expect tough elections in 2026 now want to extend the program.
Republican Roger Wicker of Tupelo, Mississippi’s senior U.S. senator, is not up for reelection in 2026, but he has at times worked with Democrats on bipartisan health bills.
In 1997, Wicker, then a new member of the U.S. House, was part of a bipartisan alliance that passed the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helped children of the working poor obtain health insurance.
The program has been pivotal in Mississippi, a state with one of the nation’s highest poverty rates and a large segment of its population working in low paying jobs. About 85,000 Mississippi children are enrolled in CHIP, according to Medicaid.gov.
The creation of CHIP occurred against big political odds. Before it was proposed, then-President Bill Clinton tried to pass his version of universal health care with First Lady Hillary Clinton leading that effort. The bill, which was derisively called Hillarycare, was savaged. The bill crashed and burned and created considerable ill will in Washington.
But in the wake of that failure, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Sens. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, passed CHIP. Hillary Clinton, history should note, is also credited with playing a role in the passage of CHIP.
Wicker was part of that bipartisan effort. Wicker, who had been a member of the state Senate only three years earlier where he chaired the Public Health Committee, viewed CHIP as a proposal that would help Mississippi families.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, who at the time was the Senate majority leader, opposed CHIP, calling it “a big government program.” Thad Cochran, the state’s senior U.S. senator, like Wicker, supported the program.
And Cochran, a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee for years, played pivotal roles in ensuring CHIP continued in future years when it appeared it might be in jeopardy.
In 2025, it will be interesting to see if Wicker or any other member of Mississippi’s congressional delegation is instrumental in ensuring the enhanced subsidies continue for the ACA exchange.
After all, all four U.S. House members and Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state’s junior U.S. senator, will be up for reelection in 2026.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190605/Roger-Wicker-7.jpg,,,2025-09-21 07:57:26.832948

A vital doctrine of animism is the attribution of conscious life to phenomena of nature. Even if our own beliefs about the soul and its corporeal habitats do not extend quite so far, though, the human mind still likes to anthropomorphize — to assign emotions and personality traits to flora and fauna as a means of extolling their value. Perhaps no one understands this better than a poet. This week, Isla Segal of Woodstock relays observations of the omnipresent, nonverbal exchanges that enliven every forest.

Trees talk
Isla Segal, 14, Woodstock
The trees talk,
you know?
They talk and if you listened,
you would know
they whisper
like kindergarteners
who can’t stand straight in line
but can jump straight
into mudpuddles.
They can’t stay quiet,
like my siblings late at night,
and the wind whistles sometimes,
and the trees call back,
you know?
And then the leaves twirl
down to the dirt,
but the branches still murmur
late into the winter,
with too much snow to talk very loud – 
but they’re still talking.
I know.

“Vermont will bear the burdens of this facility but might not directly reap the environmental benefits that it provides,” wrote a commissioner in a concurring opinion.

The Public Utility Commission gave the green light Monday to an 80-acre industrial solar field development on a sloping hillside of sprawling meadows, thick forests and agricultural fields in Shaftsbury.
Neighbors of the project and environmental advocates in southern Vermont have vehemently opposed the project first proposed in 2023 due to the potential environmental and aesthetic harm to the land. Multiple organizers said they are likely to appeal the commission’s decision to award VT Real Estate Holdings 1 LLC — also known as Shaftsbury Solar — a certificate of public good.
Alongside consideration of local impact, the commission’s decision in favor of the Connecticut developer, Freepoint Solar, owned by Freepoint Commodities, was “heavily informed by Vermont’s ambitious energy policy goals” outlined in the state’s public service statute, according to the final decision, signed by Chair Edward McNamara and Commissioner Riley Allen.
“We have also considered Vermont’s role within the broader, interconnected New England grid and our reliance on that network to maintain a reliable electric grid and to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction mandates,” McNamara and Allen wrote. 
The decision comes after Vermont reportedly failed to meet its carbon reduction targets this year, and a judge dismissed a lawsuit attempting to hold the state accountable for this failure. 
Commissioner Margaret Cheney wrote a concurring opinion to the decision, agreeing that the project “checks all the necessary boxes” of Vermont statute, but voiced concern with the location and the tree clearing required to make way for the large-scale solar project.
While the project itself will occupy 80 acres when complete, Cheney wrote that 104 acres would be disrupted during construction, including 64 acres of agricultural land. Forty-two acres of trees will be axed, including 34.6 acres of mature trees, Cheney added.
Forests sequester carbon, so tree clearing partially counteracts the greenhouse gas benefits associated with the addition to the renewable energy grid, Cheney wrote. The power and renewable energy credits created through the project can also be sold outside the state, so “Vermont will bear the burdens of this facility but might not directly reap the
environmental benefits that it provides,” she wrote.
If renewable energy development prompts deforestation and a lack of substantive benefits to Vermont utilities and customers, the commission may reconsider how they arrive at “public good” determinations for future projects, Cheney asserted.
“We should consider how to create incentives to site very large facilities away from unspoiled land and close to existing infrastructure,” Cheney wrote. “Although this goal may be best achieved through future legislative amendments, renewable energy developers should be more deliberate in identifying sites that minimize localized aesthetic and environmental impacts.”
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said the Shaftsbury project is the “solar equivalent” of the controversial, industrial-scale Lowell Wind Project over a decade prior.
While in favor of solar canopies in developed areas, Smith expressed concern about the industrial project on agricultural land increasing stormwater runoff, degrading prime soils and harming biodiversity of the area. She said the fuel energy and clear cutting of mature trees necessary for the project counteracts any positive environmental impacts. 
“This is going to do nothing to reduce carbon emissions,” Smith said. “There is no need to destroy an ecosystem in order to create solar electricity for the region.” 
Meanwhile, the town government and regional planning commission have taken a different stance on the project. 
Shaftsbury Select Board Chair Zoe Contros Kearl wrote in a Friday statement that the proposed construction has been “painfully contentious,” but that the board hopes residents will focus on the solar project’s positive impacts for the town now that it has been approved. 
“The Town will benefit from this project in numerous ways — including increased funding for our elementary school, substantial property tax contributions that will make a real difference in our annual municipal budget, and the funding of a new brush truck for our Fire Department,” Kearl wrote. 
Bennington Regional Planning Commission Planner Callie Fishburn wrote in a Thursday statement that the Shaftsbury solar project’s approval will further the region’s renewable energy goals. The commission is requiring the solar developer to manage the concerning impacts of the projects, Fishburn wrote, “including in the areas of aesthetics, preservation of agricultural soils and damage to infrastructure,” Fishburn wrote.
Steve Collier, general counsel for the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, said that “solar projects raise substantial — and sometimes competing — interests,” but a certificate of public good requires long-term protection of agricultural soils, which the developer agreed to and should be followed. 
“Renewable energy is important and beneficial. Preserving agricultural land and our ability to grow food is critical,” Collier wrote. “We are concerned about the ongoing loss of farmland and believe Vermont needs to thoughtfully use and maintain it.”
Jim Porter, director for public advocacy for the Department of Public Service, wrote in a statement Friday that the department found no engineering problems or aesthetic concerns with the project, as the developer plans to implement mitigation measures recommended by the department and neighbors to the project. 
The solar development aligns with the present and future energy service needs and conforms with the Vermont Comprehensive Energy Plan based on expert testimony provided by the Department, Porter wrote.
Judith Schwartz, a Bennington resident and environmental journalist who wrote a commentary on the Shaftsbury Solar Project, opposes the idea that deforestation is necessary for renewable energy development.
As a result of the Shaftsbury solar project development, a piece of southern Vermont’s wildlife corridor between the Taconics and Green Mountains will be lost, and threatened beech and white ash trees will be axed in the process of constructing solar fields, Schwartz said.
Tony Eprile, Bennington resident and Schwartz’s partner, said the pair are not against solar but think renewable energy should be planned in already developed areas in order to mitigate environmental impacts. He also expressed concern that the solar energy created will add to the grid rather than replace fossil fuels, feeding a “bottomless demand for energy” created by data centers and Artificial Intelligence technology. 
“Green energy is a very pretty term for somewhat less damaging energy sources,” Eprile said. “There’s no way that you can produce solar panels without doing some environmental damage.”
Kit Ausschnitt, a neighbor and intervenor to the project, noted that the company lawyers wrote in July that the economic viability of the project hinged on the Public Utility Commission making a swift decision, citing changing tariff policies and $20 million of federal solar subsidies that the developers could lose.
In a letter to the Public Utility Commission, Ausschnitt expressed concern that the developers may abandon the project after it’s begun if it’s rendered financially unviable, meaning the natural environment would be already tampered with and “no economic benefit can flow to the community, the State and the people of Vermont.”
Ausschnitt said he is in favor of ambitious renewable energy goals, but the push created by the Legislature to develop renewable energy at the expansive forests and agricultural land is “counterproductive.” 
“It’s just a beautiful natural area.” Ausschnitt said. “They’re going to destroy lots of habitat and create all kinds of environmental damage and flood risk in an area that is already prone.”
Freepoint Solar’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

(Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Louisiana has shifted one of its two large pharmacy benefits contracts for state employees away from CVS Health, but Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers kept the most lucrative agreement with that pharmacy giant in place. 

The state Office of Group Benefits will now use two pharmacy benefit managers for its health insurance plans that cover state government employees, public school teachers, local government workers, retirees and their families. Previously, it had only used the CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health. 

Louisiana lawmakers signed a new arrangement Thursday with Southern Scripts, owned by Louisiana-based Liviniti LLC, that pays the company $390.6 million to handle commercial insurance plans for the Office of Group Benefits. They also approved a contract with SilverScript, another CVS Health affiliate, for $748.8 million to manage Medicare Part D prescription plans, which many retired state workers use.

The contracts were enacted on emergency bases for 2026 with the possibility of extensions for 2027. 
For years, lawmakers have been upset with CVS Caremark, the state’s current pharmacy benefit manager. The company’s contract with the Office of Group Benefits made it difficult for independent pharmacies to serve the 212,000 public employees, teachers and others with state health coverage. 
Governments and private employers hire pharmacy benefit managers, also called PBMs, to oversee prescription medication benefits for their health insurance plans. But independent pharmacists say PBMS are driving them out of business by undercutting their reimbursement rates and favoring chain pharmacies the PBM parent companies own. 
For example, CVS Health owns Caremark, SilverScript and well over 100 pharmacy locations throughout Louisiana. 
The state’s new arrangement with Liviniti should allow more independent pharmacists to start serving those enrolled in commercial state health insurance plans. The Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association endorsed the contract a few days before lawmakers approved it. 
The state’s experience with seeking out a new pharmacy benefits manager over the past few months indicates how difficult it has been to move away from CVS Health however.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The state approached six companies about taking over its business, said Heath Williams, CEO of the Office of Group Benefits. Three were not interested and none could provide a contract proposal for Medicare Part D enrollees that was financially competitive with CVS. Only Livinti offered a deal that could go up against CVS for commercial insurance plans. 

By switching to Livinti and SilverScript, enrollees in commercial plans should have more options for pharmacies they can use, but the Office of Group Benefits will end up spending a few million dollars more than it would have if it had stayed only with CVS Caremark. 
“You are not going to save money from moving from one to PBM to another,” Williams told lawmakers Thursday. 
Louisiana faced more challenges finding a company not owned by CVS to cover its Part D enrollees because federal regulations place restrictions on how the state can negotiate that contract, he said. 
The state does expect more transparency about drug pricing as a result of the new PBM contracts. Williams said it should be easier for the state to determine what is driving up drug prices and whether rebates, which can financially benefit  PBMs, are to blame.   
“You want full transparency on rebates,” he said. 
The new PBM contracts come a few months after a dramatic showdown between the governor and the Louisiana Senate. 
During the last few days of a two-month legislative session in June, Landry pushed lawmakers to pass a law banning Louisiana pharmacy benefit managers from also owning in-state pharmacies as CVS does. The Senate refused to go along with Landry’s demands and killed the proposal, saying such a drastic move required more study before lawmakers voted on it. 

At the time, CVS claimed such a ban would force it shut down its brick-and-mortar locations in Louisiana. They exerted pressure on legislators by sending emails and texts to thousands of Louisiana residents, implying they could potentially lose access to their medications at CVS if the bill passed. 

The mass text and email campaign prompted Attorney General Liz Murrill to file three lawsuits against CVS on behalf of the state, including one regarding the text messages.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cvs.jpg,,,2025-09-21 06:56:26.059992

This story by Jason Starr was first published by the Williston Observer on Sept. 11.
Imagine, Williston’s own little black box theater. Michael Fidler and Connor Kendall did, and they have found just the spot.
At the start of the Vermont Repertory Theatre’s third season, the nonprofit theater group has found a home, tucked away in a corner suite of a building on Commerce Street. It’s a dead-end road with an eclectic mix of businesses, including an ice cream manufacturing facility and scoop shop, a veterinarian office, and a chimney parts manufacturer.
The theater suite has a performing arts legacy. It was once home to an Irish dance school.
“We had just started looking for a space and this place came up, and we said, ‘Oh wow, it’s perfect,” said Chloe Fidler, the group’s treasurer, administrator and a performer.
The Vermont Repertory Theatre started in summer 2023 with a presentation of Shakespeare’s “A Comedy of Errors” at the Isham Barn in Williston. It has returned to the barn each summer since — “Spamelot” in 2024 and “The Miser” in 2025. 
Next summer, it plans a two-weekend presentation of “Shakespeare in Love.” The barn has been a reliable summer venue for the group, and in the winter, it has performed at Main Street Landing in Burlington. Rehearsals have taken place at Williston Federated Church.
But the Commerce Street location can be an all-encompassing headquarters: a rehearsal space, performance theater, prop storage and board meeting room.
“To be able to rehearse in a space where you can have your props and your set, and they just stay there, you don’t have to bring things into every rehearsal and take them out again — it’s a total gamechanger for us,” said Chloe Fidler, who is married to Michael Fidler.
The performance space can seat 75, but it’s still in its infancy. It will make its debut in October with the presentation of “The Williston One Acts,” three one-act plays over four nights running Oct. 15-18. The group’s Main Street Landing show this winter is set to be “Uncle Vanya” from Feb. 28 to March 6.
Chloe Fidler described the company’s niche as the presentation of classic texts with high production values: “community theater, but with really high expectations,” she said.
“It’s kind of cool that it is sort of tucked away,” she said of the new space. “It’s like our little Williston secret … We’re excited to see how it all pans out.”
Auditions for the Vermont Repertory Theatre’s third season of shows will be by appointment Sept. 25-27. For more information, visit www.vermontrep.com or email admin@vermontrep.com. For show tickets visit https://theaterengine.com/productions/3018.

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderMILTON – The national Democratic Party’s top official campaigned in Georgia this weekend with Democrat Debra Shigley in hopes of helping her flip a conservative state Senate district in the north Atlanta suburbs.
Ken Martin, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, called Shigley’s surprising first-place finish in last month’s seven-way race “a huge overperformance for Democrats in a district that has historically been pretty red.”
Shigley, a Milton mom, attorney and small business owner, won about 40% of the vote in the first round of voting. She now faces a head-to-head matchup with Republican Jason Dickerson, a Cherokee County resident who is the president of a private investment firm. The district includes north Fulton and Cherokee counties.
Martin, who became the new DNC chair in February, said his visit to Georgia represents an effort to rebuild after Democrats suffered devasting losses last year and to broaden the party’s focus beyond federal power. That includes supporting candidates running for mayor, school board and other local races too, he said.
“We’ve made the mistake as a national party for too long of just focusing on what happens in Washington DC,” he told reporters Saturday.
He said Democrats are overperforming in special elections since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Some are even winning, such as a Democrat who flipped a state Senate seat representing a farming community in Pennsylvania.
“We’re happy that we’re overperforming, but there’s no brownie points when you come in second place, and you can’t get anything done when you’re in the minority,” Martin said. “But guess what? Every inch of ground that we win adds up. Every race that we flip adds up. That’s how we start rebuilding our party again, and Debra is an important part of that rebuilding process.”
Tuesday’s special election is being held to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of former state Sen. Brandon Beach, an Alpharetta Republican and staunch ally of President Donald Trump. Beach, who coasted to reelection last year with 70% of the vote, is now U.S. Treasurer.
Shigley acknowledged the challenge of winning the right-leaning district Saturday as she stood outside her Milton home, where Martin, state Senate leaders Harold Jones and Elena Parent and volunteers gathered before fanning out to knock on the doors of voters.
“We surprised the Republicans (last month), and I’m here to say that we are going to surprise them again. It is going to be an uphill battle until the finish line,” she said.
Shigley said her team had visited about 35,000 houses. Her door-knocking outings have featured a long list of prominent Democrats, with former House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams and ex-GOP Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who is now running for governor as a Democrat, set to join in for the final push.
On the Republican side, Dickerson has touted a long list of endorsements from high-profile Georgia Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp.
“We are continuing to focus on the citizens of District 21 with Meet & Greets and knocking on doors,” Dickerson said in a comment Saturday.

With racing season underway, the stakes are high.","An occasional look at Connecticut’s remarkable people, places and things
Hundreds of pigeons emerge from a slim opening in a backyard shed outfitted into a coop, their heads bobbing as their owner, Wilberto Aponte out, shoos them out, gruffly urging them to fly.
In a furious flurry, more than 200 homing pigeons take off, Aponte’s words muffled by the flapping of gray wings. They take to the sky, looping in wide circles above their home roost. Over the next half hour, those loops shrink as the flock makes its way back to land, and Aponte and his friend Victor Pagan call the pigeons home.
“Get in, get in, get in,” they cry in a sing-song falsetto.
The flight is just part of Aponte’s training for the racing season. Aponte, who is retired, is the president of the Connecticut Classic Pigeon Club, which has about 60 members, mostly in the New Britain, Hartford and New Haven areas. It’s one of a few pigeon racing clubs across the state. 
The season began late last month with a race in upstate New York. The participating pigeons were trucked to the start, then released. From there, they flew nearly 100 miles to their homes.
Club members use trackers and a formula to determine how far and how fast each pigeon flew and to assign the birds their points. The owner with the most points wins. There are 10 races each season for the club. The number of birds allowed in each race varies depending on the number of owners participating and the size of the truck to haul birds. The season lasts from August to October.
“You can also lose your wife and your kids because with the pigeons, once you get addicted, just like any other hobby, it takes your time,” Aponte said. “The new guys get excited. They start with, say, 10 pigeons, and once they win a race, that’s it. The next year, they got 100 pigeons. Something kicks in.”

When U.S. Army paratroopers, dropped behind enemy lines and cannot use radio communication for fear of revealing their positions, they use trained pigeons that were also dropped by parachute in special containers or pigeons strapped to their chests.  The pigeon, encased in a special jacket, is attached to the paratrooper’s jacket on Sept. 11, 1943.
For centuries, pigeons and humans have been closely intertwined. The birds make homes in the nooks and crannies of buildings, eat grains and trash and are sometimes fed by human tourists or “pigeon mothers,” who make a habit of feeding them, often in city parks.
Pigeons were first domesticated thousands of years ago by the Mesopotamians and Egyptians. People have used them as food, to carry messages and to learn the inner workings of genetics. They were used as messengers in both world wars and, in an experimental World War II project, to detonate missiles with their beaks. Charles Darwin studied them to write his “On the Origin of Species,” and the children’s toy G.I. Joe is named after a pigeon killed in the line of duty during World War II.
Homing pigeon racing hit a peak in the 1980s in Brooklyn and was made famous in part because of Mike Tyson’s interest in the sport. Some races are up to 500 miles, and pigeon owners can earn thousands in winnings. Researchers debate how the birds find their way home from such long distances, but most say it’s some combination of using the earth’s magnetic field, recognizing landmarks and their sense of smell.

Raising pigeons
Aponte and Pagan grew up just a few blocks from each other in eastern Brooklyn, during the heyday of pigeon racing. During that time, in addition to racing the pigeons, people would wander the city or wait on their rooftops to try to catch other people’s pigeons to sell.
“My father didn’t like it,” Aponte said. “He used to see that we used to get up early in the morning and try to catch other people’s pigeons. So then he used to get up earlier than us, because he was already up at five o’clock to go to work. He started going up in the backyard, and he started watching us … And then he got hooked on it himself.”
Aponte started raising pigeons on the roof of his family’s Brooklyn apartment when he was 12. He and his older brother would rise early to feed the birds.

At first, they kept it a secret between brothers, and when their father found out, he made them move the operation to a backyard coop. They’d get up early in the morning to travel to the other side of Long Island and buy birds, typically for $1.25 each.
As their business grew, every Sunday, they returned with about 200 birds to sell to neighbors, earning about 75 cents per bird. 
Meanwhile, at 5 years old, Pagan found a pigeon with a broken wing. He decided to capture it and nurse it back to health. That first bird was more of a pet — Pagan put a collar on it and took it for walks around the neighborhood. Over time, he and his brothers’ interest in pigeons grew, as did their new flock of racing birds. 
“I grew up with it,” Pagan said.
Their neighborhoods at the time were rough, Pagan and Aponte said. They watched many friends join gangs, start using or dealing drugs and eventually die young, violent deaths.
“Eventually you’re going to get caught in the system, and boom,” Pagan said. “It kept me from that.”

Breeding champions
For Aponte, the interest never waned. He kept raising pigeons throughout his childhood, into adulthood. When he moved to New Britain, he was able to expand the number of birds he kept. Now he has about 200. 
He keeps track of them based on the numbers attached to small bands around their legs, and it is clear: they’re not pets. He treats the birds well, but it’s more about the sport than emotional connection.
When his daughter was young, he let her keep one pigeon as a pet. The pigeon, named Tony, sat on his daughter’s shoulder while she moved through the house, dove into the suds while she washed dishes and defended her from any other animals he saw as threats that entered the yard.
In the early 2000s, Pagan moved to New Britain. He’d given up pigeon racing in his youth, but his brother had kept going. After his brother’s 2022 death, Pagan reluctantly gave away the last of the family’s flock. He didn’t know what to do with them or whether there would be a community of other pigeon people in New Britain to embrace him.

Over the next months, Pagan noticed a trend in the sky above his house. A flock of pigeons swooped in wide circles over the neighborhood, and he even saw the telltale “dropper pigeon,” or the pigeon that stays home until its racing friends draw close, then flies up and down swiftly to show them the way home and speed up their landing.
These weren’t the gray creatures that gather on sidewalks, littering New York City buildings in poop. These were larger, more graceful birds. These were racing pigeons. He decided to follow them home one day, tracing where their soaring loops ended, to find himself at Aponte’s house.
“I want to see my pigeon coming home. I want to see my training and how I train my birds to become champions,” Aponte said.

And he’s bred his birds to be champions. The process is a combination of science and instinct. The pigeon owners hope the hatchlings get larger, stronger wings, prettier colors. Some breeders say the birds’ eye color is the best way to tell a champion from the rest, but Aponte and Pagan disagree.
It’s all in the wings, the way they hold themselves, they say. And stretching out one of Aponte’s bird’s wings, allowing the light to filter through the black and white bars across its feathers, the men agree. This is a good racing bird.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PIGEONS-0821-DE-SONY-318-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-21 05:57:31.871504

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)COTTONWOOD FALLS — Just about where a visitor first sets foot inside the Chase County Courthouse a letter was found in 1950, when workmen were replacing the hardwood floor in the main hallway.
The message was slipped into a crack between the boards the last time the floor was replaced, in 1924.
“This beautiful bright February day Mr. Levi Chandler, the county treasurer, and the janitor, Harry Hudson, are laying a hardwood floor in the courthouse hall,” the letter began. “Mr. Chandler is doing the work for nothing if the commissioners will let the county pay for the material.”
The letter was written by the treasurer’s wife, Carrie Breese Chandler.
The courthouse had been completed in 1873, and the floor of the hallway had been worn nearly to splinters by tides of Chase Countians coming to pay their property taxes, to register or transfer deeds, to appear in court, to be jailed in the basement, and to marry and sometimes divorce. The building is now a Kansas icon, and the oldest working example in the state, but when Carrie wrote the letter a century ago it was already an old building in need of repair.
I was thinking about Carrie’s letter and the responsibilities of county office when I entered the courthouse on Monday, Sept. 15, and took the stairs to the courtroom on the second floor. The local Republican committee had called a convention there to nominate an interim replacement for Dow Wilson, who resigned early this month after financial “irregularities” in his department were reported.
The last time I had been in the courtroom was 14 years ago, when Kim and I had been married by a local judge. We didn’t live in Chase County, but in the county next door. Being wed in the oldest working courthouse in Kansas in a county made famous for its sense of place seemed a promising start. Five thousand days later, it still does. Just about everything appeared the same in the courtroom. Did I remember the sign taped to one door that said “JAIL,” with a down arrow? Surely it was a new sign, perhaps made for tours.
I’ve written about Chase County back in 2021, when I questioned the morality of the county running a for-profit detention center. In May of this year I revisited the topic, as the 148-bed lockup was the last and largest ICE-contracted jail facility in Kansas. The detention center is separate from the courthouse, five or six blocks to the southeast on Kansas Highway 177. If there are tours of that facility, they aren’t advertised. But that is another matter.
On Monday, I was in Chase County to observe government at its most fundamental level. Oh, I asked the questions most journalists would ask, the how manys and whens — and I was curious about Wilson, the treasurer who had resigned — but mostly I was looking for clues to an unasked question.
Who are we in 2025?
Your neighborhood may not resemble Chase County — I know mine on Constitution Street doesn’t — but that’s OK. There are many corners in Kansas, from the town of Nicodemus founded by formerly enslaved people to the Hispanic majority in Dodge City to the historically liberal college town of Lawrence. They all have some lesson to offer.
There are 2,572 people in Chase County, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and 88% of them are white. The median household income is $54,518, significantly lower than the state average. The county also skews slightly older than the rest of Kansas, with a median age of 45.
Republicans hold every elected post in the county, with the exception of a couple of township officials. Of 1,462 votes cast in the 2024 general election, 75% went to Trump. The county had a 2024 budget of $7 million, with an additional $5.4 million for the detention center.
Before the meeting I had haunted Broadway Street, that town’s long main street with the picturesque courthouse at the end, looking for a place where local residents gathered for coffee and talk. But the place I had remembered, the Emma Chase cafe, was gone. Instead, I found a group at the local Senior Center.
It was similar to what William Least Heat-Moon recounted finding in his 1991 book about Chase County, “PrairyErth.” The Emma Chase, he said, was closed and reopened and closed again, and the only place to find a cup of coffee on Broadway was at the Senior Citizen’s Center.
“Cottonwood Falls is probably not dying, but without the courthouse that issue would be moot,” Heat-Moon noted. “Of the thirty enterprises along Broadway, the one commercial street, half are federal, state, or county offices.”
More than three decades later, Cottonwood Falls is still probably not dying.
At the senior’s center I sat with a group of men in coveralls and work clothes ranging in age, I’m guessing from about 40 to more than 70. They allowed it would be all right to ask a few questions, but none of them wanted their names to be used.
I asked about Dow Wilson and the group exchanged tight smiles.
Wilson had been elected treasurer in 2017 (as a Republican, of course) and served a time as jail administrator. All the men knew him or his family and some of them had worked for him at the detention center. He may or may not have had a new job with the state. He had won it big at a casino. And he was still on the board of the Flint Hills Rodeo Association. Held in nearby Strong City, it’s the oldest consecutive running rodeo in Kansas.
All of the men knew about the investigation into the finances of the treasurer’s department. None of them said an unkind word about Wilson.
Wilson lost last year’s primary election to Bernice Albers.
Albers, a native Kansan who moved to Cottonwood Falls in 1989 and taught high school business and English, won the nomination by 34 votes. She told me that she had considered Wilson a friend but had not spoken to him since he mounted a fierce write-in campaign for the 2024 general election.
Albers won easily, 879 to 521.
Unlike other county officers, the term for Kansas county treasurers begins on the second Tuesday in October following the election. While the clerk and sheriff and others began their new terms in January, Wilson had nearly a year ahead of him before handing over the keys. By August 2025, according to the Emporia Gazette, Wilson reportedly stopped keeping business hours, came in on weekends, and had hired a part-time employee to take up the slack.
He was still drawing his full salary of $46,469.
During the first week of August, he won $362,606 playing “Mississippi Stud” poker at the Prairie Band Casino at Mayetta, north of Topeka. Wilson had, according to a social media post by the casino featuring a photo of Wilson, won the progressive jackpot on a side bet with a royal flush, the best hand possible.
Then a bombshell came at the Aug. 29 meeting of the county commission.
“Sheriff Jacob Welsh and (County) Attorney Brian Henderson informed the Board that CPA Cindy Jensen had uncovered irregularities in the financial records with the Treasurer’s office during the annual audit,” according to the minutes of that meeting. “After research Jensen was unable to justify any allowable legal reason for the discrepancies. Jensen reached out to Chase County Treasurer Dow Wilson who said he would look into it but never got back to her.”
The amount in question was between $50,000 and $100,000. The county commission approved a forensic audit by a third party, at an estimated cost of up to $25,000. Welsh was also given access to all county bank accounts from 2022 to present.
Wilson resigned early this month.
Henderson, the county prosecutor, declined to comment on the investigation. The county clerk, Connie Pretzer, told me the commission had not yet received the 2024 audit from Jensen, so she was unable to provide a copy.
I reached Wilson by telephone.
“Hey buddy, I have no comment at this time,” he said.
But wouldn’t he like to tell his side of the story? Explain what happened? At least share some tips on playing Mississippi Stud? Anything?
“No.”
At the courtroom on Monday, the convention lasted 30 minutes. The lone nominee was treasure-elect Albers. After a short speech from her, the committee asked the public to step out while the party voted. Albers was selected to fill Wilson’s unexpired term, pending appointment from the governor.
After the meeting, Albers said she was optimistic because she had confidence in the treasurer’s staff. She also said she had not been privy to any of the details of the investigation.
“I’m kind of in a grey area, because at this point I don’t really have any authority,” she said. “For right now, I’m not a part of it. I know what I read in the newspaper.”
She said the allegations were shocking.
“When I ran, I just wanted to retire (from teaching) and do something different,” Albers said. “I didn’t really have any thoughts about what this might turn into. It’s been almost a year-and-a-half journey, and there have been so many ups and downs.”
I asked her what question she would most like answered.
“Are we all doing what we can to do what’s right for the people of Chase County?” she said.

As citizens we tend not to notice what goes on in government. No matter how old the building is, courthouses — and those people who hold offices inside them — are part of the background noise of our lives. Paying taxes, renewing car tags, dealing with jury duty notices are common experiences, whether we find them merely inconvenient or downright dreadful. You probably haven’t thought about the courthouse much unless you work there or have been summoned to one. But a working government is the infrastructure that makes our lives possible. And a functioning government requires the trust of the people it serves — and the willingness for the people to contribute to the greater good.
As Americans we tend to mythologize the past, to imagine that things were better a generation or even a century ago. As Kansans, we like to imagine that we are part of an unchanging frontier heritage, and the Chase County Courthouse is part of that gospel.
It’s pleasant to visit Cottonwood Falls and walk Broadway and admire the postcard courthouse at the end where you can still enter without having to go through a metal detector. But if you actually lived in Chase County — not just visiting on a Saturday for a sunflower wedding — if you were one of the county’s citizens, more would be expected. It isn’t the local limestone or the native walnut railings that keep the courthouse vibrant, it’s people.
Chase County is part of the answer to who we are in 2025.
We are the overall-clad coffee drinkers at the Senior Center, the county attorney reticent about speaking to the press, the newly minted treasurer facing a problem whose outlines are yet unknown to the public. We’re the visitors seeking a bit of Americana, the predominantly Latino ICE detainees in the detention center, the journalist from just out of town who asks a lot of questions. We’re also the former county official at the center of a gathering storm.
We are in a period of transition, buffeted by forces both economic and partisan, and sometimes of our own making, and whether we find our way through in a form that will be recognizable as American to subsequent generations depends on how we treat each other.
It’s the essence of citizenship.
Heat-Moon became a temporary citizen of the county and contributed to the greater good in his own way, by producing what he called a “deep map.” Some of the residents I met at the Senior Center remembered the writer, and they allowed he got some things right.
“A Kansas City reporter once called Cottonwood Falls a dusty jewel, but it has more fundamental substance, more usefulness than that,” Heat-Moon wrote. “Rather, it’s a chiseled block of native stone, burnt by the sun, otherwise plain, practical, humble, and ordinary except for the tarrying past that each year makes Cottonwood stand out a little more from other Flint Hills towns either dying or embracing some prostitute of progress.”
If Cottonwood Falls ever turns the 1873 courthouse into a museum or something other than a working building, it will embrace probably dying rather than probably not. The courthouse is a living, functioning thing, a constant in the lives of Chase County residents.
In the 1924 letter that Carrie Breese Chandler slipped between the new boards in the courthouse hallway, she recalled how the courthouse had always been a part of her life.
“I can remember as a small child, sitting in the east window on the third floor and seeing antelopes running on the hills east of town,” she recalled.
Elsewhere she recalled reading books at the courthouse, because that’s where the county library was located.
She finished the letter with this:
“There is a crack left where I can put this letter under the floor, so here it goes,” she said. “Good luck to the finder.”

I’ve seen others shave or put on makeup. Give me a break!","How many of you remember “Car Talk”, the wildly popular NPR show with Tom and Ray Magliozzi, also known as “Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers?” Not only were they brothers, but both graduated from MIT. They were walking encyclopedias of automotive wisdom. And common sense.
To them, car safety meant more than just mechanics. It meant drivers should be smart about their motoring. Their popular bumper sticker read “Drive Now, Talk Later.”


They meant talking on cellphones, of course. But to update their mantra you could add “Text Later.”
That’s actually the law in Connecticut: All drivers must use hands-free devices for phone calls, and it is illegal to text or use any hand-held mobile device while operating a motor vehicle. If you’re under age 18 you’re not allowed to use any cellphone, hands-free or otherwise, while driving.
Last year’s “Put the phone away or pay” campaign in East Hartford and Manchester saw 365 tickets issued in a single month while state police tallied almost 600 citations in the same period. And we’re talking a $200 to $625 fine.
But I see it every day… people can’t put down their phones. I’m behind a guy at a red light.  It changes to green and he doesn’t move, obviously checking his phone. A slight tap on the horn (after a very patient 10 seconds) and he finally takes off.
Are we all so addicted? I honestly wonder what parents with an SUV full of kids are thinking when they drive down busy streets juggling a latte in one hand and a cellphone in the other.
Once, when stuck in crawling traffic on I-95, I actually saw a guy reading a book. I’ve seen other drivers shaving or putting on make-up. Give me a break! But I’d carry that message of attentive commuting to other travel environments as well, especially on the train.
Several years ago, while serving on the CT Rail Commuter Council, I tried to persuade Metro-North to establish “quiet cars” on their trains… cellphone free environments where riders seeking peace wouldn’t need to hear some self-centered hedge-fund dealer yelling at his trading desk in a voice that carries through the entire car.
“Hey. It’s me.” Who cares? “I’m on the train.” Yeah, I know. “Just thought I’d check in on that last trade.” I wish I could check out.
Years after Amtrak and other commuter rail systems adopted “quiet cars,” Metro-North finally agreed to give it a try in 2011. But they never enforced the rules and dropped the plan, using Covid as the excuse.
If we used to have smoking and non-smoking cars, why can’t we have “quiet cars” as well?  The problems of annoying chatter persist. A ticket on the train buys you transportation, not the right to annoy your fellow passengers with a recitation of your woes.
A friend on Metro-North says she was seated next to a woman on the phone complaining to a friend about her day and a splitting headache. When she hung up my friend asked if she needed a Tylenol. Cell-lady gave her a “Hrumph” and accused her of eavesdropping.
What’s the proper etiquette for cellphone use on the train?
Try to make the call short and at a low speaking volume, and cup your hand around the mouthpiece. If a longer call is necessary, get out of your seat and talk in the vestibule. And to make sure that incoming calls don’t bother anyone, leave your phone on vibrate.
It’s just a matter of consideration of your fellow riders.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cell-phone-in-drivers-hand-e1758305073639.jpg,,,2025-09-21 04:56:08.825528

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — and the national response — was a major talking point Saturday at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition fall banquet for GOP speakers, who said his shooting was a call to action for Republicans.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Iowa Republicans shared their memories of the Turning Point USA cofounder at the annual fundraiser held in Des Moines. The event began with a moment of silence and prayer for Kirk and a memorial video.
The fatal shooting of Kirk on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University has fueled a national discussion among politicians and others about the need to prevent future instances of political violence and lower polarization. There has also been a significant push to condemn and pursue punishments for people who celebrate or make controversial statements about the right-wing influencer, including in Iowa, where the Board of Regents directed state universities to investigate social media posts allegedly made by employees about Kirk.

Many on the slate of  Republican speakers shared their personal experiences with Kirk. Noem, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson shared stories of their children watching videos of Kirk’s speeches and debates online, and the importance of defending free speech in the wake of his death.
Noem said she stayed in close contact with Kirk during her time in public service, and shared a story of getting a text message from him the day before he was killed.
“When I went back to look at what the last text was that I had gotten from him, I realized I hadn’t replied to it,” Noem said. “He had sent it to me the day before he passed away, and he said, ‘We have to hold these mayors and governors accountable.’ We have to hold them accountable. And I was traveling and meeting with other security ministers from other countries, and I had completely missed it. And I will forever be sick that I didn’t respond to him.”
She said she would have told Kirk, “I’m on it,” and added, “I think he knows that.”
Noem, as well as Moreno, are planning to attend the memorial service for Kirk, scheduled for Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance will be in attendance, as will many other top Republican leaders from across the country. Moreno also shared his experience meeting Kirk, who asked him for support in founding Turning Point USA, and added,  “it hasn’t quite hit yet that Charlie’s gone.”
He said Kirk’s killing is in part the result of the U.S. losing “its moral center of spirituality.”
“I think what he would hope for us, more than anything else, is that we literally imagine this as a quite literal turning point in our country’s history,” Moreno said. “Where we just say, ‘We’re not going to allow this to happen. We will not lose this country for the next generation. We will do everything possible to spread the word, always speak our minds, defend free speech and absolutely refuse to cede an inch to the lunatics that would take over this country.'”
Ernst said at the event the loss of spirituality, which Moreno called an “empty hole” in many people, is “rampant across the folks on the left in the Democratic Party.”

“They are consumed by that darkness and that hole,” Ernst said. “And that’s why it is so easy to embrace abortion — abortion on demand. But it’s also been very easy for them to be swallowed in that darkness and not valuing life, where they believe they can go out and take a life when they disagree with that person’s position. And we saw that quite clearly a week and a half ago with the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
Conservative CNN political commentator Scott Jennings, who gave the keynote address for the event, also linked Democrats and left-wing beliefs with Kirk’s death. He said the Democratic Party wants to “control everything,” from speech to acceptable vehicles and stoves.
“They want government to make decisions that you should be making for yourself and for your family,” Jennings said. “And if you disagree, if you speak up, if you push back, as a matter of politics, or even as a matter of faith? Well, we saw what happened to Charlie. We saw what happened nearly to our president last summer. We saw what happened in Minneapolis. We saw what happened in Nashville. Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you tonight we have seen enough – enough.”


Ernst addresses her retirement
Ernst also made comments at the fundraiser about her decision not to run for reelection in 2026 in one of her first public appearances since announcing her exit from the race. She said she was leaving the office to devote time with her family, in addition to bringing up a vow she made during her 2014 campaign to only serve two terms in the U.S. Senate.
“I also had made a commitment early on that I would serve two terms,” Ernst said. “And so I have term limited myself and will be stepping aside because I think it’s the right thing to do for the next generation.”Ernst said she supported Hinson’s campaign for the position she currently holds, saying, “that seat belongs to you, the seat that I currently occupy.”

Federal authorities have not found evidence linking the man charged with the shooting, Tyler Robinson, to left-wing organizations, according to NBC News.
As politicians shared their memories and thoughts on the incident, Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed also invoked Kirk, as well as Trump, who has faced assassination attempts, as he asked for financial support for the organization.
“I want you to think of the price that Charlie Kirk paid last Wednesday,” Reed said. “He bore the ultimate burden. He paid the ultimate price. I want you to think about what President Trump and his family have been put through in the last 10 years — indicted, they tried to bankrupt him, they debanked the Trump Organization, they impeached him twice. And then after they did all that, they tried to kill him. You see, if you’re not willing to put it all on the line, this goes away.”
Speakers tout Trump immigration policies
In addition to speaking about Kirk, immigration was a major topic for speakers at the event. Noem said Kirk was one of her biggest supporters in implementing Trump’s immigration and deportation policies at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and spoke about her work with the president on his promises to increase border security and “build the wall.”
Moreno, who was born in Columbia and immigrated with his family to the U.S. at a young age, said he believes more Latino voters will begin voting for conservatives in upcoming elections, saying many people in these communities have Republican values, on issues like faith, education, and on LGBTQ+ issues, saying, “there is no word for transgenderism in Spanish” and “family means a mom and dad together, married.”

He also said he believed most legal immigrants from central and South America shared his perspective on immigration. He said it is “an honor to be welcomed to this country” legally, and that allowing undocumented immigrants to gain citizenship outside the established immigration process is insulting to those who went through proper channels.
“Imagine that somebody takes away that honor from you, and the way they take that honor away from you is by allowing people to come here illegally and then reward them,” Moreno said. “Let the people skip you in the line be the ones who are somehow sympathetic — when in reality, you know, people do not hire illegal migrants because they’re compassionate about illegals. They want to take advantage of those people, and that is the most horrifying idea that the Democrat Party has today. I find it insulting and I find it extremely demeaning.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — While Byron Donalds hasn’t received the backing of Gov. Ron DeSantis in his quest to succeed him as governor of Florida next year, the U.S. House member from Naples has no problem showering the love on the state’s chief executive.
“We have the best governor in America right now,” Donalds said Saturday during a campaign appearance in Tampa. “I don’t play political games. He’s the best. We have to build on what he has done and take our state to a whole ‘nother level.”
Donalds, the Trump-endorsed early frontrunner for the Republican nomination for governor next year, got deep into policy prescriptions while addressing a crowd of at least 150 people who gathered at La Teresita, a Cuban eatery in the city’s Hispanic district.
The candidate spent nearly half of his hour-long visit answering questions submitted in advance by members of the audience.
The property tax issue
One such query asked whether he would support a proposal on the 2026 November ballot to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes “without all the legal jargon where one can understand in simple terms what they’re voting for?”
“That second part is going to be really hard,” Donalds immediately responded.
“Would I love to eliminate property taxes? Yes,” he said. However: “If we eliminate property taxes in the state of Florida, we’d have to double the sales tax.”
He went on to say that doubling the 6% sales tax statewide would lead to a decrease in tourism from working people and thus isn’t a real option (the co-chair of the select committee in the Florida House studying the issue has already said that the total elimination of property taxes is a non-starter).
Instead, Donalds offered a couple of remedies — included raising the homestead exemption from $50,000 to between $300,000 and $400,000.
“So, you do that on homesteaded property, and then you create a harder cap that would have to apply for the school taxes,” he said. “Because Save Our Homes and all the other homesteaded exemptions do not apply to school districts. They only apply to the cities and the counties. … It has to apply to [school] districts as well to see a real decrease in property taxes.”
Another suggestion he made was that the millage rate assessed by local governments should instead be set by the county tax collector.
And he said that if elected he would continue the DOGE efforts enacted by Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia. “Everybody’s budget is going to be examined. Every year. All the time. Not just local. But state as well.”
He called the idea of property tax reform a step in the right direction, ultimately, “because at the end of the day, we can’t have people being priced out of their homes. We can’t have it. I don’t care what project you got going on in your local government. If you’re pricing people out, then guess what? That’s a bad project. You need to go back to the drawing board.”
He’s no longer all about charter schools
Donalds, who served in the Legislature from 2016-2020 before moving on to Congress, said he’s evolved in his thinking on one form of education policy.
“When I first got to the Legislature, I used to think that charter schools were the only thing that could change education, and I thought it was ‘all charters, all the time,’” he said.
And now?
“I’ve gotten off of that,” he said. “I’m agnostic when it comes to schools. In terms of which schools are allowed and which schools are not. That’s one of the reasons why I am such a vehement supporter and believer in parental empowerment and true school choice.”
He said state educators need to start looking at so-called “co-locational schools” as a remedy for school districts suddenly populated with fewer students but the same number of physical buildings.
“If there’s a fledgling charter school, a fledgling private school, or a fledgling parochial religious school and they’re trying to get started and parents are choosing them, why is the school district having a building that’s half empty? Co-locate the schools. Allow those fledgling schools to come up.”
And he said it’s time to figure out how to build nonpublic school infrastructure, an idea he acknowledges is “outside the box.”
“If our parents are choosing nonpublic options, and we fund education because we believe that funding education is in the interest of the state and the future of the state, then we are going to have to look at solutions for nonpublic schools,” he said. “I think you can do it in a way that the taxpayer actually gets a semblance of a return and they’re not left holding the bag. So there’s a way to be able to deliver that.”
Another idea? Microschools, which has been described by EdChoice as a reimagining of the one-room schoolhouse, with small class sizes and curricula tailored to fit the needs of each class.
“Parents are saying, ‘You know what, we’re going to do a microschool. I think we should be open to all of that,” he said.  Florida lawmakers passed a bill (HB 1285) in the 2024 session that opened more options for school locations in the state. The measure allows private charter and microschools to rent or buy spaces like churches, libraries, community centers, theaters, or museums in the state to operate in.
One proposal that Donalds doesn’t appear to be on the same wavelength with Gov. DeSantis is to ban all vaccine mandates in Florida.
“We’re going to look at all the things that are rulemaking, not statutory,” he told the Phoenix as he exited the stage. “Stuff that’s statutory like mRNA vaccines? Probably not going to touch that.” SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-9-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-09-20 17:57:13.137512

Newsom signed laws meant to protect immigrants during President Trump's extensive deportation program. Some of the measures raise constitutional questions and likely will be challenged.,"In summary
Gov. Newsom signed laws meant to protect immigrants during President Trump’s extensive deportation program. Some of the measures raise constitutional questions and likely will be challenged.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a set of bills meant to check the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in California, including a first-in-the nation measure to prohibit officers from wearing masks and others that limit their access to schools and hospitals. 
The new laws echo the “resistance” measures California adopted during the first administration, when it passed a so-called sanctuary law to limit local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents, among other policies. 
“Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back,” Newsom said at an event in Los Angeles where he signed the legislation.
President Trump promised a historic deportation effort and assault on sanctuary-style policies when he took office for the second time. His administration criticized the state’s new immigration laws even before Newsom signed them. 
The Department of Homeland Security earlier this week called on Newsom to veto the mask bill — one of the more contentious pieces of immigration legislation — calling it “despicable.” 
“Once again sanctuary politicians are trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a Sept. 16 press release.
California may struggle to enforce the new laws, some of which have already raised constitutional questions around the state’s role in federal operations, but lawmakers maintain that they are legally defensible. 
California political consultant Mike Madrid said in signing the laws Newsom is showing that he can stand up and fight, whether or not he has a chance of winning. 
“In this moment, when there are very few cards to play for state governments and state legislatures, California has done what no other state has done: establish itself as the tip of the spear on resisting a lot of these efforts that are an affront to its values,” said Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. 
“99% of this is the purview of the federal government. So a lot of it is just symbolic, but symbolism matters. It’s both politically astute but also morally right,” he said. 
The package of bills Newsom signed included:

Assembly Bill 49 prohibits schools from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.
Senate Bill 627 widely prohibits federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. 
Senate Bill 805 requires that law enforcement officers identify themselves while conducting their duties, with some exceptions. 
Senate Bill 81 prohibits immigration enforcement from entering restricted areas of a health facility without a judicial warrant or court order. 
Senate Bill 98 requires schools and higher education institutions to send community notifications when immigration enforcement is on campus, and prohibits immigration enforcement from entering certain areas without a judicial warrant or court order.

California Democrats began drafting immigration-related bills almost as soon Trump took office in January. Those efforts accelerated after the Trump administration launched aggressive immigration sweeps throughout Los Angeles, which led to weeks of protests and a subsequent National Guard deployment.
“All of this legislative resistance is to protect Angelenos from their own federal government. That is profound,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference with Newsom and other Democratic leaders.
Will the laws make a difference?
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said the legislation may have a marginal impact on federal immigration enforcement operations.
In 2018, for instance, California passed a law to restrict immigration arrests at superior court buildings. That hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from detaining people at those courts this year.
“The federal government is going to continue doing what it’s doing, in one form or another,” he said. “I do think the legislation gives some hope and optimism to communities that feel under fire, vulnerable and basically hated by the federal government.”
Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center, remains hopeful that the package of bills will ensure safety for people attending school and accessing health care.
“With most laws, there has to be really vigorous monitoring, both by the state as well as by advocates to ensure that it’s truly being implemented and followed,” she said. 
California police opposed mask ban
The most controversial bill in the package was Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener’s proposal to widely ban federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The law, also known as the “No Secret Police Act,” does not apply to certain forms of face coverings, such as face shields, and it exempts some officers, including those who are undercover. Officers who violate the law will face an infraction or misdemeanor.
Wiener and Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez and Aisha Wahab championed the legislation after seeing footage of masked and unidentifiable agents carrying out operations.
“ICE’s recklessness creates chaos as agents run around with what are effectively ski masks and no identification, grabbing people, throwing them in unmarked vehicles, and disappearing them,” Wiener of San Francisco said at a legislative hearing in August. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust.”

California’s law enforcement groups widely opposed the bill, arguing it will largely apply to local police, rather than federal agents, because the federal government is likely to sue on constitutional grounds. 
“It’s using an emotionally charged issue on a federal level to pass a bill that will only affect local peace officers,” said Brian Marvel, president of the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions. “You’re upset with the feds, but you’re going to punish us.”
Other law enforcement experts echoed those concerns, arguing that it’s illegal to interfere with federal operations. 
“California cops are not going to enforce this law,” said Ed Obayashi, a longtime California police officer who now is a special prosecutor and policy adviser to the Modoc County Sheriff’s Office. “You cannot regulate lawful federal conduct, whether the Legislature likes it or not.” 
The law allows officers to be sued personally for “tortious conduct,” including if they assault or falsely arrest someone while masked. 
“Private enforcement could be the avenue where enforcement is the likeliest,” said Johnson.
The bill caused hours of contentious debate on the Senate and Assembly floors, with many Republicans calling it misguided. 
“My immigrant family is not afraid” of ramped-up immigration enforcement, Fresno Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa said, “because we did not break the law.”
But Democrats were animated because just days before, the U.S. Supreme Court had sided with the Trump administration and ICE for conducting roving sweeps through Los Angeles, apparently catching bystander day laborers or anyone who appeared Latino in their dragnet. The bill, they said, was their way of pushing back.
“We need a full front defense for the violence that is coming from this regime,” said Hector Pereyra, policy manager for the nonprofit Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, which co-sponsored the mask bill and another bill to protect the private data of street vendors. “We have to respond with a united front of strength and aggressiveness, not of passiveness.”

A federal judge in Missoula this week found that the U.S. Forest Service violated the law when authorizing expanded commercial livestock grazing leases north of Yellowstone National Park.  
In an order handed down Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Donald Molloy found that an Environmental Assessment conducted by the Forest Service was insufficient, as it did not adequately address the impacts to grizzly bears, an endangered species. 
“Despite knowing that livestock conflict remains a leading cause of death for grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Forest Service sought to expand cattle grazing on public lands surrounding the National Park,” said Patrick Kelly, Montana director with Western Watersheds Project, in a press release. “Judge Molloy’s decision has thankfully halted this misguided and illegal effort, likely preventing the deaths of many more grizzly bears.”
The order affirmed an earlier decision by federal judge Kathleen DeSoto.
Western Watersheds Project led a coalition of conservation groups in filing the lawsuit against the chief of the U.S. Forest Service and several federal agencies in 2022, arguing the government failed to consider the effects of expanded cattle grazing north of Yellowstone National Park on grizzlies under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.
The groups alleged that greenlighting grazing on an additional 1,356 acres for cows, along with a longer stock season with young calves, would lead to increased conflicts with grizzlies and greater mortality for the bears. 
The lawsuit notes portions of the six grazing allotments in question are in the grizzly bears’ Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem recovery zone. 
Arguing before Judge DeSoto last fall, a lawyer for the conservation groups, Matthew Bishop, said the Forest Service’s analysis of impacts was so cursory, it should at the very least be redone: “We heard more today on connectivity (for grizzly bears) than what’s in the record.”
But the Forest Service argued that it took a “hard look” at potential impacts on grizzlies as is required under NEPA, and the environmental assessment found limited impacts to the species’ population in the area. Attorneys for the federal government argued that because the proposed scope of grazing is limited, the impacts to grizzlies was also limited. 
This spring, DeSoto ruled in favor of the conservation groups. Under NEPA, she wrote, the federal government had failed to consider how the expanded grazing, and the cumulative effects of both public and private activities in the area, might affect connectivity of grizzly populations, a key to the species’ recovery and survival. She also found the agency failed to prepare an environmental impact statement, which is required by NEPA. 
However, she dismissed part of the complaint that the federal government had violated the Endangered Species Act. 
Both parties objected to parts of DeSoto’s ruling, but Molloy’s September order affirmed the decision. 
The court ultimately remanded the decision to the Forest Service to prepare a new analysis and vacated the decision to expand grazing on the six allotments. 
“The science is clear: grizzly bears need safe, livestock-free passage between population cores in order to fully recover,” said Lizzy Pennock, carnivore coexistence attorney at WildEarth Guardians, in a press statement. “We are grateful the judge redirected the U.S. Forest Service toward the best available science and its legal responsibility to protect wildlife.”
The other plaintiffs in the lawsuit are the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, the Native Ecosystems Council, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Wyoming Wildlife Advocates, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Bitterroot, Wildearth Guardians, and the Gallatin Wildlife Association.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Grizzly_credit-USGS-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-09-20 12:59:25.153017

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A long-running effort to broaden Colorado’s air pollution rules to include health limits on lesser-known hazards took another step forward on Friday, but advocates were again left frustrated by what they called a “missed opportunity” to go further.
Members of the state Air Quality Control Commission voted 8-0 to adopt an updated set of rules known as Regulation No. 30, establishing benchmarks for a group of “priority toxic air contaminants” identified by the commission earlier this year. The new health standards still need to be approved by the state Legislature, and they won’t be used in permitting or regulatory proceedings for at least another year.
Their enshrinement in Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment rules is another milestone for environmental and community groups that have fought for them for years — but it came with a reminder of the power that the business lobby has wielded in opposing those efforts at the state Capitol and beyond. Commissioners opted for a set of higher limits proposed by industry groups, rather than the lower limits proposed by environmental groups or a middle-ground position endorsed by CDPHE staff.

“This was a missed opportunity for the Commission to put community health first,” Patricia Garica-Nelson, an activist with nonprofit environmental organization GreenLatinos, said in a statement. “Coloradans came forward with powerful stories about the direct harm they face from toxic air pollution, yet decision-makers still chose weaker standards for most contaminants.”
The new rule’s five priority contaminants, also known as “air toxics,” were identified by state regulators with input from a scientific advisory group. They are among a class of hundreds of compounds classified as hazardous air pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA, however, only sets federal health standards for a core group of six well-known “criteria” pollutants, including ozone and carbon monoxide, which are the target of extensive regulations under the Clean Air Act.










These exposures don’t act alone — they pile up, creating cumulative harms that send kids, the elderly, outdoor workers, and families living close to oil and gas wells to the ER and even shorten lives.


– Dr. Maria Chansky, advocate with Healthy Air and Water Colorado


In the absence of federal limits, Colorado has lagged behind other states in establishing its own state-level air toxics rules, and CDPHE came under scrutiny for allowing industrial pollution sources like Suncor Energy’s Commerce City oil refinery to effectively set their own emissions limits. After several years of trying, lawmakers representing Denver-area communities succeeded in passing a 2022 law directing the AQCC to begin regulating certain air toxics.
The five priority contaminants identified in the new rules are:

Benzene, a volatile organic compound often associated with oil and gas production and linked to leukemia and other adverse health effects
Hexavalent chromium, often emitted by industrial metal production and linked to lung cancer and respiratory problems
Ethylene oxide, often used to sterilize medical equipment and linked to cancers and respiratory problems
Formaldehyde, often associated with the production of wood products and resins and linked to cancers and other adverse health effects
Hydrogen sulfide, often associated with oil and gas production, wastewater and food processing plants, and linked to a variety of adverse health effects

High levels of hydrogen sulfide are believed to have caused the deaths of six people killed in an incident at a dairy farm in Weld County last month.
State law requires the AQCC to adopt “emission control regulations” pertaining to priority air toxics by April 30. CDPHE staff didn’t perform an economic impact analysis on the rule adopted Friday, they wrote, because for now it will have “no regulatory impact on any person, facility, or activity.”
“Once approved by the General Assembly, the health-based standards may be integrated into regulatory and/or permitting requirements,” staff wrote. “An analysis of potential economic impacts will be done at that time.”
The AQCC, a volunteer commission appointed by the governor, set the new standards by drawing on a variety of existing recommendations from EPA health assessments and regulations in other states. But members sided with industry groups in adopting a high “hazard quotient” for non-cancer exposure risks, rather than a lower quotient backed by CDPHE, which agency staff argued would account for cumulative exposures and provide “ample margin of safety, particularly for vulnerable groups.”
“These exposures don’t act alone — they pile up, creating cumulative harms that send kids, the elderly, outdoor workers, and families living close to oil and gas wells to the ER and even shorten lives,” Dr. Maria Chansky, a Glenwood Springs physician and advocate with Healthy Air and Water Colorado, said in a statement. “In light of ongoing federal environmental rollbacks, it is more important than ever that Colorado safeguard our air through strong health-based standards to curb harmful air toxics.”
Though he voted for the rule’s adoption, AQCC commissioner Jon Slutsky voiced uneasiness with siding against the calls of community advocates who testified before the commission about their experiences “living close to the problem.”
“When we have people in the community coming before us, time and time again … I think we have to do more than just listen to them,” Slutsky said. “We have to actually give them some love.”

Caldwell also emphasized his desire for transparency and teamwork in the caucus.
Caldwell replaces former Rep. Rose Pugliese, who resigned on Sept. 15. In her resignation letter, Pugliese cited a desire to spend more time with family and a “toxic” environment in the Legislature. She had a public quarrel with Democratic leadership on the last day of the recent special session over allegations that she covered up for a former lawmaker who shared an unprofessional photo of a Democratic lawmaker in a private group chat.
The Legislature reconvenes in January. Democrats have strong majorities in both chambers.
“We’re going to hit the ground running,” Caldwell said. “We’re not going to stop until November of next year, when we’ll all be celebrating that we’ll have more members.”

The decision from Circuit Judge Daniel Green concluded that lawmakers properly combined bans on gender-affirming treatments for minors with reproductive rights in the proposed constitutional amendment but misled voters with the ballot language.
Quoting a Western District Court of Appeals ruling from 2020, Green wrote that “it was insufficient and unfair for a summary statement to fail to ‘alert voters to that change in some fashion.’”
And the ballot language, he wrote, fails to alert voters that it would repeal the reproductive rights section of the Missouri Constitution approved in the 2024 election.
In the ruling, Green ordered Secretary of State Denny Hoskins to submit revised language within seven days. Green also found that the “fair ballot language” summary posted on Hoskins’ office website was misleading for also failing to state abortion would be banned in most cases, and ordered revisions to be submitted within seven days.
The challenge to the proposal, which will appear as Amendment 3 on a ballot next year, asked Green to throw it out entirely for combining abortion and gender-affirming care for minors under 18. 
During an August hearing, attorney Chuck Hatfield argued that the inclusion of the gender-affirming health care ban was “ballot candy” meant to win over more voters but is a separate issue from reproductive health care.
Green disagreed in his ruling, saying the two issues are closely related enough to meet constitutional requirements for a single subject. In a footnote, Green pointed to the website of the Columbia Planned Parenthood clinic, which lists abortion and gender-affirming care among the services provided.
It is the ballot language that does not mention the abortion rights repeal, that is “insufficient and unfair,” Green wrote.
Republican state Senate leaders shut down a Democratic filibuster in May to push the measure to the ballot. 
If approved by a majority of voters, the abortion ban amendment would repeal a citizen-led reproductive rights amendment that passed last November legalizing abortion in Missouri until the point of fetal viability and enshrining other reproductive rights in the constitution, including in-vitro fertilization and contraceptives.
The new amendment would reinstate an abortion ban, allowing limited exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomolies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
After Hoskins delivers the revised language, parties in the case will have three days to submit arguments on whether it satisfies legal requirements.

The Interior Department agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Thursday to revoke a key approval for the SouthCoast Wind project — an approval granted by the same agency in January in the final days of the Biden administration.
If the federal government’s request is approved, it would deal another blow to the beleaguered project — which has been delayed at least two years due to the Trump administration — and the industry at large.
This is the second time in a week that the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the other being for Maryland’s US Wind project. It comes just weeks after the Interior Department in court filings expressed its intent to remand not only its approval for SouthCoast Wind, but also New England Wind — two important projects for Massachusetts and New Bedford.
While the January approval, formally termed the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), gave the green light for construction, SouthCoast Wind was still hamstrung by three outstanding federal permits, and no power purchase agreement with Massachusetts or Rhode Island.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought by the Town of Nantucket in March against BOEM and Interior’s approval of the project, which calls for up to 147 turbines and would sit about 20 miles south of Nantucket (and south of Vineyard Wind).
This latest move illustrates the growing role that lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups against offshore wind are playing in President Trump’s crackdown on the industry. Of the 20 or so actions and orders issued since January, one has directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests.
“BOEM is reviewing its approvals associated with the Project and has determined, based on its review to date, that it wishes to reconsider its COP approval. That is reason enough to grant a remand,” the new motion states.
Nantucket is asking the federal government to “set aside” its record of decision approving SouthCoast Wind and restart its environmental review — a process that took more than three years to complete and culminated in key permits allowing the project to move toward construction.
In Thursday’s filing, the government suggested the town’s concerns (and lawsuit) may become moot: “BOEM likely will take a further agency action, and that action may affect — and possibly moot — Plaintiffs’ claims.”
The motion and a declaration filed by BOEM Deputy Director Matthew Giacona are littered with references to Trump’s day-one wind memo and the subsequent actions that it has borne.
This includes the withdrawal of a 2021 opinion on how the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) should be interpreted, and the reinstatement of an opinion from the first Trump administration on the law. The motion states that BOEM staff are reevaluating all agency decisions that relied on the since-withdrawn 2021 opinion, which also informed the approval of New England Wind.
Under the reinstated opinion, Giacona said, SouthCoast Wind’s COP approval may not be compliant with OCSLA.
“BOEM determined that it ‘may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,’” the motion states. “BOEM also found that the Environmental Impact Statement and other record documents may have ‘understated or obfuscated impacts that could have subsequently been improperly weighed in making the determinations.’”
Giacona’s declaration also appears to call into question the lease itself, which SouthCoast Wind paid millions for and has been paying hundreds of thousands in annual payments to the federal government since.
He said the project-wide review, ordered under the day-one wind memo, “could result in identifying potential issues with SouthCoast’s lease” and that the timeline for that review is “uncertain.”
Ocean Winds North America, the project’s parent company, in a statement to The Light said it plans to “vigorously defend our permits in federal court.”
“SouthCoast Wind’s Construction and Operations Plan (COP) was approved … after a rigorous four-year review,” the statement read. “This review reflected an extensive public process that incorporated feedback from federal and state government agencies, commercial ocean users, Tribal Nations, and many other stakeholders. Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States.”
SouthCoast Wind is an intervenor in the case and opposed the government’s motion. The project plans to use the Port of New Bedford for staging out of the Marine Commerce Terminal and for long-term operations and maintenance.
Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said a delay or cancellation of New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind could mean a loss of up to 200 jobs in the city.
According to Oceantic Network, an organization supporting the industry, SouthCoast Wind expects to invest $6 billion in the U.S. through wages for union labor; shipbuilding with a Louisiana port and shipbuilder; steel from Alabama and Kentucky; and investments in port infrastructure, including the New Bedford terminal.
Gov. Maura Healey, in an emailed statement Friday, said the project will create “thousands of good-paying jobs” and provide reliable, affordable power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.
“This project has been thoroughly vetted and has already undergone years of expert review,” Healey said. “There is absolutely no need for the Trump Administration to reopen permitting processes and deny jobs, investment and energy power to the states.”
Healey’s office did not respond to a question as to whether it plans to intervene.
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge.
Per the federal government’s filing, “District courts have broad discretion to grant or deny remands and may deem a remand inappropriate ‘if the agency’s request appears to be frivolous or made in bad faith,’” but it also says courts “commonly” grant them.
As this plays out, more than a dozen states, including Massachusetts, are waiting on a federal judge to rule whether Trump’s first-day wind memo, the action underlying all of this, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states, which are relying on the projects to meet climate mandates and rising grid demand.

By Ryan Colasanti, contributing Journalist
GREENWOOD, DE — Milford running back Andrew Sivels settled two yards behind his quarterback in the pistol formation with his pink gloves resting on his knees. Buccaneer quarterback Cayden Jarrett received the snap and turned toward Sivels.
Sivels took the handoff, took three steps to his left, paused as the running lane closed and redirected toward the middle of the field. Sivels’ patience paid off as a wide open running lane emerged, allowing him to sprint upfield for a 46-yard touchdown on Milford’s first offensive possession of the game.
Sivels scored four of the Buccaneers’ five touchdowns, leading Milford to its first win of the season, 35-0, over the Woodbridge Blue Raiders, Friday night.
Sivels, junior Tyjere Perry, and senior Gregory Lockett were a dominant trio on the ground. The three ball carriers combined for over 200 rushing yards and accounted for all five of Milford’s scores.
Four of the five touchdowns belonged to Sivels and the junior was responsible for over 120 of Milford’s rushing yards. Sivels’ ground totals were boosted by a 57-yard touchdown in the middle of the third quarter, adding to his long touchdown in the first. Sivels’ other two touchdowns came on shorter runs near the goal line as did Perry’s lone touchdown run on the Buccaneers’ opening possession out of halftime.
Jarrett’s right arm did a good job complementing the run game. Jarrett completed a few passes, including a deep pass down the right sideline to Jayden Williams for a gain of 32 yards that set up Perry’s touchdown run a few plays later. Williams made a tremendous catch, leaping over his defender to come down with the grab.
The Buccaneers’ defense fed off the energy of its offense and held the Blue Raiders without a score. Woodbridge was able to drive into the red zone a couple of times, but Milford’s defense stopped them before they could reach the end zone. The Buccaneers also forced a couple of takeaways in the first half that stalled any momentum Woodbridge developed.
The Buccaneers’ 35 points are the most they’ve scored this season, topping the 33 they scored in their first game of the season against Conrad. Milford’s victory breaks a stretch of four consecutive losses against Woodbridge dating back to right after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Blue Raiders will try and bounce back from this game as they travel to Abessinio Stadium next Thursday to take on a Howard team that beat Appoquinimack Friday night.
The Buccaneers will try and build off their victory against Delmar next Friday in their third of four straight road games after beginning the season at home.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/milford-vs.-Woodbridge-2025-scaled.png,,,2025-09-20 09:59:12.315501

The numbers come from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which reports bird flu detections in eight commercial South Dakota flocks and one backyard flock in the state during the last 30 days. 
Meanwhile, South Dakota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said blue-winged teal, a species of duck, have been identified as carriers of this season’s virus. John Cooper, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent and former state Game, Fish and Parks secretary, said it makes sense that the state would find itself combating bird flu early this year if teal are carrying it.
“Teal are traditionally our first migrators,” Cooper said.

Detections this early in the fall season are troubling, according to Thompson. The peak avian influenza seasons typically happen later during the fall and spring migration of wild birds, which can carry the virus without becoming sick.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, the state Department of Health said “bird flu has the potential to be transmitted to humans from wild birds” but emphasized the risk to people remains low. 
The department pointed to federal guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offers steps for hunters to reduce risks:

Gut and de-feather game birds in the field rather than at home and practice good hygiene to prevent disease spread.
Use dedicated tools for cleaning game, do not use the same tools around poultry, and wash and disinfect all tools and work surfaces afterward.
Wear gloves, a mask and eye protection when handling game birds.
Throw away the gloves and facemask afterward and wash hands with soap and water.
Cook meat to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Commercial turkey products remain safe to eat thanks to existing food safety protocols in the industry, according to Thompson.
The bird flu depopulation process is federally mandated and involves killing all birds at affected sites to prevent the virus from spreading to nearby farms. Thompson said “foaming” is the most common method in turkey barns, where foam is sprayed atop turkeys inside the barn to suffocate them. 
She said the process is carried out with assistance from federal and state officials who oversee the work, with the federal government offering compensation for losses through indemnity payments. Those payments have totaled more than $1 billion nationally since 2020, according to an analysis by CBS News, including about $130 million in South Dakota.

Each has its own funding challenges. Some may put an emphasis on college preparation while others may seek to get students ready for the workforce. The beauty of local control is that it allows the school district patrons, through their school board, to decide how students should be educated.
That individuality is apparent in the way districts have approached student use of cellphones in the classroom. According to a South Dakota Searchlight survey and analysis of school district policies, about 60% of school districts in the state restrict cellphone use for at least part of the school day. About a third of districts take the further step of locking away students’ cellphones for at least a portion of the day.
While some schools may restrict student cellphone use in an effort to keep them from being distractions, in Wilmot the students are allowed to keep their phones as a way to teach them a lesson in responsibility. This contrasts quite a bit with the policy in other districts including Dupree, where high school students are required to put their cellphones in containers during the school day.
Three of five SD governor hopefuls endorse statewide approach to cellphones in classrooms

It’s that kind of difference, from school district to school district, that helps reflect the philosophy of educators, the needs of the individual communities and the strength of local control.
“There’s never going to be a one-size-fits-all,” said Dupree School District superintendent Brent Mareska.
Well, hold the phone.
One policy for every school district is exactly what three of the five candidates for governor are proposing. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, a Republican candidate for governor, said in a South Dakota Searchlight story that he would back a statewide prohibition on student access to cellphones during classes.
“The state government setting a broad-stroke policy and then having the execution of that strategy and management done at the local level will give us the best of both worlds,” Johnson said.
Of course, one of those worlds, in Pierre, would set the policy for all the school districts. Those districts, whether they like it or not, would have to carry it out, without regard for their current cellphone policy. A policy that may be working just fine for them.
South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen, another Republican candidate, would also support a statewide policy as a way for students to focus “on learning, not on distractions.” Democrat Robert Arnold, a 20-year-old college student who plans to run for governor, said a statewide policy would benefit students.
Another Republican candidate, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, said the decision on cellphone policy should be left up to school boards, though his approach seems more like a Mafia don than a governor: “As governor, I would absolutely lean on our local school boards to ban cellphones from the classroom.”

While Doeden would make school districts an offer they can’t refuse, Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has yet to declare his candidacy, is quizzing school leaders about whether they want their policy to come from the local level or the state. Some schools may welcome a state law, allowing them to put what could be an unpopular policy in place, all the while laying the blame at the feet of the Legislature.
Judging by the performance of the Legislature in 2025, it would be wise to leave decisions about education to school districts. A completely unscientific search of the Legislative Research Council website found that the Legislature considered 59 education bills this year. Among them were such winners as a failed requirement to display and add to the curriculum the Ten Commandments, a withdrawn effort to defund the Huron School District because of its bathroom policy, and a failed requirement to display the state seal.
A track record like that doesn’t inspire confidence in a Legislature or a governor who wants to make a one-size-fits-all cellphone policy. Obviously school districts are getting by just fine without a mandate from the state about how to regulate cellphones in the classroom. That’s how local control is supposed to work.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2158370531-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-20 09:59:12.315501

Jones, left, and Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell. Photos courtesy of Washington State University and University of Washington. For the first time in nearly a decade, Washington’s two largest universities welcomed new presidents within the same year. 
Elizabeth Cantwell became the first female president of Washington State University in April, and Robert J. Jones, in August, became the first Black president of the University of Washington. 
The two leaders made a joint appearance this week at the Association of Washington Business 2025 Policy Summit, in a panel mirroring one held at the summit in 2016. 
The summit brings together business leaders, policy experts and elected officials.  
During the panel, both university leaders lamented the breakdown of partnerships between universities and the federal government, and emphasized the need for more investment in higher education, especially in research.
“There’s an absolute bottom line for the time period that we’re in. If you continue to disrupt that bottom line, it will take decades to recover this nation to being the cutting edge for innovation, if we’re able to recover,” Jones said. 
Like most universities, Washington State University and the University of Washington each rely heavily on federal and state research dollars, as well as tuition, to maintain their operations. 
The money invested into research goes back to local economies, Cantwell said, adding that the research done at the University of Washington and Washington State University has helped drive the state’s economy for decades. 
“The ability to continue doing that is in jeopardy at the moment,” she added.
Jones and Cantwell both stressed the importance of continuing research into quantum computing and artificial intelligence. 
Both are developing fields that will become critical within the next decade, Jones and Cantwell said. 
“It’s not just about creating that technology. It’s: How do you also start to think about the research and innovation? How do you connect that to workforce development and opportunities for young people when they graduate to have jobs in this area?” Jones said. 
Washington is “incredibly well-positioned” to be a leader in quantum computing and AI research, Cantwell said. But amid ongoing state and federal budget pressures, further development in these fields will depend on how well institutions can collaborate rather than compete with each other.  
“There has to be this wide, deep collaboration among institutions that have the wherewithal to solve the problem,” Jones said. 
The presidents also acknowledged challenges around attracting students and the need to adjust their institutions’ offerings to cater to shifting workforce needs and to collaborate with K-12 leaders to increase high school graduation rates. 
Compared to fall 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate enrollment this year  is down by about 4,600 students at Washington State University. At the University of Washington, it climbed by about 2,500 students between 2019 and the 2024-25 academic year.
Education leaders blame sluggish enrollment on drops in high school graduation rates and college readiness, but also the growing notion amongst students that college degrees aren’t valuable in the current economy. 
“A college degree is not just a personal benefit,” Jones said. “It’s a community benefit. It impacts all of us.”.
University leaders, Jones and Cantwell said, have a responsibility to work with K-12 educators to improve college readiness and to work with businesses to ensure students are learning the skills they need to get quality jobs. 
Teaching skills related to evolving technology like AI, as well as investing in training for specific trades, will likely be part of the solution, they said.  
“We all have, as public institutions, the obligation to provide the education that we have to the people who want it where they are and when they need it,” Cantwell said.  
Cantwell previously led Utah State University for 18 months and has held senior research positions at the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, as well as roles at several national laboratories. 
She pointed to Washington State University’s history as a land-grant institution, which receives money from the federal government for agricultural teaching and research, as a reason why she accepted the position. 
“There is a thread of history that is still meaningful today and meaningful into the future,” Cantwell said, calling Washington State University “one of the most iconic land grants in the entire country.” 
Jones joined the University of Washington following nine years as the chancellor of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and three years as president of the State University of New York at Albany. Before entering administration, he was a faculty member at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities for 34 years. 
“This is not my first rodeo, but it clearly will be my last,” Jones said, adding that he is excited to be “leading a university like the University of Washington at one of the most exciting but also most challenging periods in the history of all of our education.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/uw-wsu-presidents-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-20 07:56:58.478410

The Quantifying Uncertainty and Action to Help Optimize Growth […],"Northern quahog clams. (Photo by NOAA Fisheries/Julie Rose)A bipartisan bill introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) aims to address the decline of the quahog and other shellfish populations on the East Coast — and the legislation even bears the name of Rhode Island’s official state shell.
The Quantifying Uncertainty and Action to Help Optimize Growth of Shellfish (QUAHOGS) Act would create a research task force of state and federal agency representatives, fishery management councils, and industry leaders dubbed the “East Coast Bivalve Research Task Force” to find out why fewer bivalves are in the water.
At its peak in 1959, nearly 5 million pounds of quahogs were harvested from Rhode Island waters, according to a March 2024 report by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). Between 2020 and 2023, that number was less than 500,000 pounds.
“Quahogging in Narragansett Bay is a quintessential Rhode Island trade whose harvest brings us the Ocean State summer staples of clear chowder and stuffies,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “Unfortunately, quahog and other shellfish landings are in steady decline across the Eastern Seaboard, and it’s been difficult for shell fisherman and researchers to pinpoint exactly why.”
A state legislative commission spent nearly a year studying the quahog’s decline, but the 13-member panel never firmly settled on a definitive cause following eight public hearings. Their final report published in June 2024 did note that global climate change may be having an impact. More likely, the panel said, low levels of nitrogen in Narragansett Bay has decreased the nutrients quahogs feed on. 
The nitrogen decrease resulted from the state’s goal to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment facilities, leading shellfishermen on the panel to urge the state to permit additional nitrogen discharges treatment plants during the winter to fertilize more phytoplankton that feed quahogs.
The commission’s report stopped short of recommending such discharges.
Instead, the report called on lawmakers to increase funding for the state-funded Shellfish Transplant Program — which involves moving shellfish from waters that are closed off due to pollution into other areas where commercial harvesting is permitted. The practice began in 1954 and has occurred annually in Rhode Island since the late 1970s, with funding provided by fines levied on municipal wastewater treatment facilities.
This year saw a House resolution that would have allocated $2.3 million for the DEM to transplant more quahogs into Narragansett Bay and establish a shellfish hatchery program, but the proposal died in committee.
Commission members also recommended establishing a permanent quahog advisory commission or similar board composed of stakeholders — somewhat similar to the federal proposal now floated by Whitehouse.
Stephen DeLeo, a spokesperson for Whitehouse’s office, confirmed the state legislative commission served as inspiration for the bill.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Five Idaho legislators participated in a bipartisan conference for American state legislators this week that took place in and was sponsored by Israel amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner, R-Eagle; House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, House Local Government Committee Chairwoman Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls; House Judiciary, Rules and Administration Committee Chairman Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa; and Rep. John Shirts, R-Weiser, participated in the trip.
Boise State Public Radio first reported Wednesday that Idaho legislators were among 250 state legislators from across the United States who visited Israel to participate in the 50 States, One Israel conference. 
Skaug, Shirts and Rubel confirmed publicly they participated in the trip. Efforts to reach Ehardt and Tanner were unsuccessful on Friday.
The Idaho state legislators’ visit occurred amid the ongoing Gaza war as Israel sent ground troops and tanks into Gaza City. This week the U.N.’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory released a report stating Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. 
On Tuesday, the Idaho Israel Alliance posted photos of Rubel, Shirts, Skaug, Ehardt and Tanner planting a tree and Idaho flag at Ofakim Park, one of the Israeli communities attacked by Hamas and other militant groups on Oct. 7, 2023.
Four of the Idaho legislators on the trip are Republicans. 
Rubel, who is Jewish and a descendant of Holocaust refugees, was the only Idaho Democrat on the trip.

 Group of Idaho Democrats call for Rubel to step down from Idaho House minority leadership

On Friday, the Idaho Young Democrats released a statement strongly disagreeing with Rubel participating in a trip financed by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A group of Idaho Democrats also circulated a letter Friday condemning Rubel for participating in the trip and calling for Rubel to step down from her leadership position and reconsider serving in public office.
Rubel told the Idaho Capital Sun she was invited by the Israeli Consulate and chose to go on the trip because she viewed it as a unique learning experience. As a Democrat in the political minority in Idaho, Rubel said she often has to meet with and work with people she disagrees with. Rubel said she viewed the Israel trip in a similar light and said the trip proved to be a valuable learning experience. 
“I didn’t think there would ever be a time when I would again have this level of exposure to decision makers, this ability to ask questions or the ability to access places I otherwise never would have,” Rubel said Friday. “It was an educational opportunity to inform myself and convey my own concerns to decision makers at a level I would probably never have an opportunity like that again.”
 Skaug and Rubel said they did not spent any Idaho taxpayer dollars on the trip

Skaug said Friday that he was invited on the trip by the Israeli Consulate out of San Francisco, which paid for all the expenses.
Skaug said he believes he was invited because he is pro-Israel and co-sponsored Senate Bill 1086, Idaho’s Anti-Boycott Against Isreal Act, in 2021. 
During the trip, Skaug said he heard from several Israeli leaders and was in close proximity to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Skaug said he also visited the old city wall of Jerusalem, where he prayed and posted photos taken with Shirts and Tanner. 
Skaug said he took the trip to build relationships, learn from people in Israel and meet other legislators from across the U.S.

“We have legislators go to Taiwan, China, Mexico and all over the world on trade missions or to build relationships,” Skaug said. “That is the same as how I see this Israel trip, to build relationships and also hopefully more trade.” 
Skaug said he and other legislators met with families who lost loved ones in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel.
As he traveled home Friday, Skaug said he left feeling hopeful for peace in the Middle East. 
Reached Friday, Shirts confirmed he participated in the trip too. Shirts is a former assistant U.S. attorney for Idaho who was appointed during President Donald Trump’s first term and serves as a prosecutor in the Air Force Reserve.
“I am a strong supporter of Israel and its fight against terrorism,” Shirts said in a written message to the Idaho Capital Sun. “I was grateful for the opportunity to see firsthand the challenges Israel and the region are facing and to strengthen relationships with a longtime ally of our country.”
Rubel also said she did not spend Idaho taxpayer dollars on the trip. She said she made it clear to organizers her visit is not an endorsement of Netanyahu’s government.  
During the trip, Rubel said she spoke up in front of Israel President Isaac Herzog during a state dinner and said the American public has grave concerns about the civilian casualties in Gaza and that the staggering loss of life is causing Israel to lose the hearts and minds of the American public.
Rubel also said she asked about famine in Gaza and sought out people with different perspectives and viewpoints. 
“I went to gain a deeper understanding of this conflict and to have direct conversations with leaders about the war in Gaza — including asking hard, necessary questions,” Rubel wrote in a message posted to social media Thursday. 
“As a Democrat in Idaho’s superminority, I often engage with people whose views are very different from mine,” Rubel added. “Listening and asking questions isn’t a sign of agreement — it’s a way to build understanding and find a path forward, even when the issues are deeply painful and divisive. The suffering in Gaza is unimaginable, as is the suffering of the families of the October 7 victims and hostages. Tens of thousands of innocent people, including children, have been killed or displaced. Families have been torn apart, and entire communities destroyed. This violence must end, and many across the world will likely have to participate to bring a lasting peace.”
“As a Jewish woman and the descendant of Holocaust refugees, I carry a personal connection to this region and its history,” Rubel wrote in Thursday’s message on social media. “My family’s story is one of survival in the face of hatred, and that history fuels my commitment to justice, even when it requires difficult conversations. For more than a decade, I’ve fought tirelessly for progressive causes here in Idaho, and have found that it is always a good idea to learn more about every issue and perspective.”

In a statement released Friday, the Idaho Young Democrats said it strongly disagreed with Rubel’s decision to participate in the trip. 
“At a time when Palestinians are facing violence and a disturbing humanitarian crisis — a genocide – her participation in this trip sends the wrong message,” Idaho Young Democrats said. “While we appreciate her explanation, in which she clearly condemned the actions of the Israeli government, we feel that given the nature of the trip, her decision to participate does not reflect the values of our community.”
The Idaho Young Democrats also spoke out against Republicans on the trip and said Rubel has a duty to distinguish between herself and her Republican colleagues. 
“Last year, the Idaho Democratic Party overwhelmingly passed a ceasefire resolution introduced by Idaho Young Democrats, affirming our party’s commitment to peace, justice, and human rights,” the Idaho Young Democrats said. “We continue to condemn the mass displacement, indiscriminate bombing, and killing of countless civilians by the Israeli government, and reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire, release of all hostages, and to fight against antisemitism, which has skyrocketed. We call for accountability and solidarity from our legislators.”
On Friday, 157 people who identified themselves as Idaho Democrats signed a letter to Rubel and issued a press release calling on Rubel to step down from her leadership position with House Democrats and apologize to Idahoans. 
As House minority leader, Rubel is the highest ranking Democrat in the Idaho House of Representatives
The letter included the signers’ first and last names, followed by their legislative district number.
In bold letters, the letter states “Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.”
“Less than 50 miles from your Israeli-funded propaganda trip, Israel has been engaged in the nonstop bombardment of Palestinians for nearly two years,” the letter states. “Israel has killed at least 64,964 people and wounded at least 165,312 Palestinians — over 10% of the population of Gaza…”
Shiva Rajbhandari, a climate activist and former Boise School District Board member, signed the letter and shared it with the Idaho Capital Sun. Rajbhandari is a registered Idaho voter affiliated with the Idaho Democratic Party, Idaho voter records show. Rajbhandari is a college student and activist studying public policy and sociology at the University of North Carolina. 
Rajbhandari said he has called on all Idaho legislators who participated in the Israel trip to resign. But the letter from Democrats is specifically addressed to Rubel as a leader of their party, Rajbhandari said. 
“The 157 signers are focused on the moral leadership of the Democratic Party and differentiating our party’s politics from the pro-genocide platform of the GOP,” Rajbhandari told the Sun on Friday morning.

Margo Juarez of South Omaha visits with Glenn Valley Foods workers who were detained during a June 10 immigration raid in Omaha and held in the Lincoln County Jail in North Platte. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — After three months in ICE detention, legal fees mounting and no release in sight, Nuri Garibo Chona did what she called unimaginable. She left behind four daughters to return to the birthplace where she hadn’t lived for decades. The Omaha mom was here illegally. Her kids are all U.S. citizens, and younger ones now are in the care of her oldest daughter, who is 27. 
Another woman ensnared in the Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid in Omaha also was removed to Mexico last week without her two children, who remained in Omaha with their dad. On her way out, Leydy Solis Factor said she still was confused about why the work permit she got through proper channels was no longer good.

Meanwhile, one of the men still held from the raid in the Lincoln County Jail has hired a local lawyer to replace an out-of-state firm and prays he hasn’t lost a shot at being released on bond. He has a wife and children in Omaha and fears for their safety if he is forced back to Guatemala.
The number of Glenn Valley workers detained in this North Platte jail, which is paid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain migrants, has dwindled since the high-profile worksite raid executed June 10 by more than 80 federal and local agents. 
Shortly after the Nebraska Examiner visited the facility last week, Garibo Chona and Solis Factor were removed from the country, and three other women were released on bond, leaving six from the Glenn Valley raid among those in custody there. 
ICE officials did not provide specifics when asked this week for an update, but of the original group of roughly 80 arrested, a spokesperson previously said about a dozen were released early and 63 were sent to North Platte. Several agreed to voluntarily deport themselves, and many have been released on bond as their lawyers build cases to prevent forced removal.
To State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, their journeys and circumstances have become even more relevant as the state prepares to repurpose a state prison into a  300-bed ICE detention center in McCook, a town of about 7,200 residents about an hour from North Platte.

Last week she became the first state lawmaker to sit down with Glenn Valley detainees. The discussion ranged from medical, legal and interpreter services to how their children were faring. After meeting with men and women garbed in black and white stripes, Juarez stepped into a nearby hall and cried. 
She said she’s on a mission to ensure that federal ICE detainees in Nebraska have access to the same services offered to state inmates in state prisons.
“It was really difficult to see the reality, the human faces,” said Juarez, whose South Omaha district includes the Glenn Valley plant and other meatpackers that traditionally have attracted immigrant workers.
 “These are people locked up away from family,” she said. “We have jailed innocent working people.”
* * * 
The federal government has a different viewpoint. 
Representatives of ICE and its Homeland Security Investigations arm have repeatedly referred to the Glenn Valley case as a targeted, federal criminal investigation aimed at stopping the widespread use of stolen identifications by foreign-born workers to gain jobs.
“These so-called ‘honest workers’ have caused an immeasurable amount of financial and emotional hardship for innocent Americans,” HSI’s Mark Zito has said. “If pretending to be someone you aren’t in order to steal their lives isn’t blatant criminal dishonesty, I don’t know what is.”
Court documents track the Omaha raid  — the largest immigration enforcement action in Nebraska since 2018 — back to a March subpoena that sought company employment records tying 107 of 177 employees to fraudulent IDs or documents that didn’t authorize them to work in the country.

At least one defrauded U.S. citizen already had lodged identity theft complaints with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration. During the raid, agents questioned a worker whose job application matched the name of that complainant — leading to the arrest of Guadalupe Cabrera Mejia.
To date, available federal court records show Cabrera Mejia as the only Glenn Valley employee criminally charged for the alleged use of a stolen ID. Asked how that reconciled with “widespread” criminal activity alleged earlier, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nebraska said ICE determines whether to pursue felony criminal charges. 
With regard to the Glenn Valley probe, she said, ICE elected “overwhelmingly” to pursue administrative charges in immigration court, a venue and process independent of federal prosecutors.
ICE has said an administrative charge is often a more expedient option, a faster path to deportation. The raid came as federal agencies are under pressure from the Trump administration’s goal of making 3,000 related arrests per day and pursuing mass deportations.

In Nebraska, Gov. Jim Pillen, backed by many legislative Republicans, has pledged resources to help President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda. Among state offerings: turning the McCook-based Work Ethic Camp into a Midwestern ICE detention center that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink.” 
That conversion plan requires the relocation of 186 state inmates elsewhere in a Nebraska correctional system already ranked as the most crowded in the country, when measured by operational capacity. The decision to offer ICE state assistance sparked protests at the Governor’s Mansion and a four-hour public hearing that drew dozens of opponent speakers and no proponents.
Scant details shared about the project is partly what Juarez said spurred her to make the trek west to the jail in North Platte and prison in McCook. 
“This isn’t going away,” she said. “They’re amping up enforcement, and I really wanted to see and hear from these families for myself.”

On a day last week, Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer accompanied Juarez into separate cell blocs for men and women. The Examiner was allowed as well.
Women set aside Bibles and art materials and huddled around the silver table where the lawmaker sat. An interpreter from a local advocacy group called Hope Esperanza helped bridge any language gaps.

Kramer praised the nonprofit’s founder, North Platte native TinaMaria Fernandez, for having eased stress that came with the sudden swell of inmates whose first language was different from that of his staff. 
The arrival of the Glenn Valley group increased the jail population by about 50% at a time the facility was short-staffed, Kramer said. He said the federal government pays the county $74 a day for each ICE detainee and covers transportation and medical expenses.
“If I remember it right, they called to see if we could take them and said they’d be here in three hours,” Kramer said. 
Juarez viewed as a positive sign the rapport between Hope Esperanza, Kramer and his team and detainees. She wondered out loud if McCook has a similar community organization able to assist in that town’s future ICE detention operation.
Fernandez said that while McCook is about an hour’s drive away, she didn’t see her team being able to provide similar humanitarian outreach at that facility, since the oversight would be federal versus local county officials. 
Most of the women, in response to Juarez’s queries, said they hadn’t visited with family members face-to-face but had been able to communicate via video conferencing. 
Jail staff have been respectful and responsive, several said. Another added: “It’s ugly. We’re locked up.” 
Isabel Ponce, a 34-year-old mother of three kids who are with their father in Omaha, said anxiety was “pushing my limits.” 
For some, legal relief has been grinding or nonexistent.
In Garibo Chona’s case, for example, an immigration judge ordered her removal from the country. She was torn about appealing and leaving her daughters but said the judge told her he would not change his mind if her case came before him six months later. She was removed from the country last week.
Solis Factor said she had a government-issued permit to work while awaiting a court hearing, so she at first was not concerned she’d be detained. But many immigration programs and rules have changed since Trump took office for the second time in January. And a judge ordered her removal.
“I want my children to stay and continue their education and learning English,” she said of her kids, ages 5 and 10.

In the men’s detention quarters, Juarez asked a small group if they had a criminal background.
“We are workers,” said Juan Ramirez Jacinto of Guatemala. He said he had three children and a wife in Omaha and was especially worried about a daughter who hadn’t been able to sleep well.
Ramirez Jacinto’s first lawyer was part of a group based in another state. His new attorney, Jamie Arango of Lincoln, said she is trying to make up for time lost to ineffective counsel and will seek his release on bond. 
Even with attentive representation, Arango and other experts say an already complex immigration system on top of fast-changing federal policies understandably leaves clients puzzled.

Indeed, the swiftly-evolving immigration landscape has been playing out in an Omaha courtroom.
U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon at least nine times has rejected attempts by the federal government to deny the release of Glenn Valley workers on bonds already granted by an immigration court judge.

The three most recent cases were decided Sept. 11 and involved women who had met with Juarez. Among them was Yurenia Genchi Palma, a single mother of three U.S. citizen children who had been in the country more than 20 years. 
Though an immigration judge in mid-July granted Genchi Palma’s release on a $7,000 bond, federal attorneys blocked it by filing an “automatic stay.” Nebraska Appleseed, which represents her, called that a new practice driven by the “interim guidance” leaked in a July 8 internal memo from the Trump administration. 
The new approach seeks to make nearly all detained immigrants facing removal proceedings ineligible for release on bond, with an aim of making more of them more likely to self deport, experts say. 
ICE has said the changed direction “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. Such measures are needed, says Trump and other supporters of stepped-up immigration enforcement, to reverse past patterns.
Bataillon ruled the automatic stay provision and prolonged detention unconstitutional despite a Sept. 6 decision days before by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which had affirmed the “interim guidance.” 
As a federal court judge, Bataillon is not required to follow the decision of the BIA, an administrative body in the executive branch. He questioned the legal rationale behind the analysis but said that wasn’t his concern. 
He said his ruling was based only on the lawfulness of the automatic stay. 
Grant Friedman of ACLU Nebraska foresees continued legal challenges and noted that the ICE no-bond practice already is being challenged in a separate national class action lawsuit. He said ACLU and other advocates are on heightened alert.
“The immigration landscape is rapidly changing,” Friedman said. “We are doing everything we can to make sure people are being treated fairly, that they have their rights respected.”
Anne Wurth, associate legal director of the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, which has assisted many Glenn Valley workers, called the current landscape “absolute chaos.”
 “We have a system that is punishing individuals we rely on in our workforce and who are just humans who deserve to live their life with freedom,” she said.

Juarez said dealing with immigration-related matters was not something she expected as a state officeholder. She’s the first Latina in the Nebraska Legislature and is serving her first year as a state lawmaker.

A Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, she recently clashed over immigration policy in an email exchange with former Nebraska governor and now U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Nebraska, and plans to urge the state’s all-GOP congressional delegation to push for immigration reform. She toured the  McCook jail after leaving North Platte, and vows to monitor the conversion and amplify related budget discussions. 
“There’s no doubt I’m going to stand up,” said Juarez. “My community expects that.”
For Ramirez Jacinto, each day in detention brings worry. Is his daughter able to sleep yet? Are the house bills paid? Will his family in Omaha go with him if he’s deported? How will they escape the violence?
“I’d like my family to stay, but who would work?” said Ramirez Jacinto. “I’m the worker.”

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Complaints filed with the Arkansas Ethics Commission this week claim three Republican state officials and political action committees tied to them “appear to have repeatedly and willfully violated” state campaign finance law.
The co-founders of an online legislation tracking and analysis firm said in a press release Friday that they’d filed the complaints with the ethics panel. By law, the ethics commission cannot confirm it received the complaints.
The 29-page package provided by ArkLeg Bill Tracker co-founder Janie Ginocchio alleges that Attorney General Tim Griffin, state Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, and state Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, and PACs associated with them violated campaign contribution limits and prohibitions on illegal coordination of contributions, the use of public property for campaign purposes and public servants receiving outside payment for carrying out official duties. 
“The enclosed materials detail a pattern of conduct centered on Attorney General Tim Griffin and his PAC, Jobs and Growth (JAG PAC), which allegedly utilized a network of controlled PACs — including those operated by his campaign manager, Rep. David Ray; Sen. Ben Gilmore; and associates of the Gilmore Strategy Group — to launder contributions, evade contribution limits, and obscure the true source of campaign funds,” a letter accompanying the complaints states.

Ginocchio’s complaints also allege that Ray’s receipt of campaign funds from Griffin, while a sitting legislator who filed bills affecting the attorney general’s office, created a severe conflict of interest and the appearance of quid pro quo.”
Ray, Gilmore and Griffin all characterized the complaints as frivolous and politically motivated. 
The package of complaints include allegations that:

Griffin illegally accepted over-the-limit campaign contributions, used state resources for campaign purposes and “convert[ed] campaign funds into a personal slush fund to pay for official government operations.”
Griffin’s political action committee, Jobs and Growth PAC, violated state ethics law by using a state vehicle owned by the attorney general’s office for campaign-related purposes.
Ray improperly accepted more than $130,000 in cash from Griffin’s campaign during legislative sessions, “constituting unlawful outside compensation for his official duties as a state legislator” and that the payments coincided with Ray’s sponsorship of several bills that expanded the power of the attorney general’s office.
A network of PACs controlled by Griffin, Gilmore, Ray and Gilmore Strategy Group, owned by the senator’s brother Jon Gilmore, “worked in concert” to conceal the true source of funds to Griffin’s campaign.
Gilmore Strategy Group PAC made contributions over the campaign finance maximum of $3,300 per election to Griffin’s campaign.
Base Point PAC, the senator’s political action committee, made over-the-limit contributions to Griffin’s campaign.

In a text to the Advocate, Griffin said: “These politically-motivated complaints are a total joke and are deeply unserious to anyone who knows anything about Arkansas law. My campaign and political action committee go to great lengths to follow all applicable laws and rules, and I look forward to this frivolous complaint being dismissed.”

“It is without a doubt a frivolous attack against me and other conservative Republicans,” Ben Gilmore said in an email, “and it is without question politically motivated. As always, I will continue to follow the law and should the Ethics Commission contact me, I will work with them to prove that to be the case.”
Ray said the complaint “might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever read. It is completely false, totally frivolous, and not even worth the paper it’s printed on. These left-wing activists are attacking me because I’m an effective Republican legislator and they don’t like my politics. I am not intimidated by their baseless attacks — in fact, they only motivate me to work even harder to advance conservative policies and principles.”
Ginocchio also filed ethics complaints against Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge and Secretary of State Cole Jester for filing incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tim-Griffin-debate-e1697496889763-1024x605.jpg,,,2025-09-20 05:56:59.835594

(timnewman/iStock via Getty Images Plus)Before the United States began vaccinating all infants at birth with the hepatitis B vaccine in 1991, about 18,000 children every year contracted the virus before their 10th birthday — about half of them at birth. About 90% of that subset developed a chronic infection.
In the U.S., one in four children chronically infected with hepatitis B will die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Today, fewer than 1,000 U.S. children or adolescents contract the virus every year — a 95% drop. Fewer than 20 babies are reported infected at birth.
I am a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist who studies vaccine delivery and policy. Vaccinating babies for hepatitis B at birth remains one of the clearest, most evidence-based ways to keep American children free of this lifelong, deadly infection.
On Sept. 18, 2025, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, debated changing the recommendation. According to the proposed language of the vote, infants whose mothers test positive for hepatitis B would still receive the vaccine at birth. Infants whose mothers do not test positive for hepatitis B would get the vaccine at 1 month of age, though parents would have the choice for them to receive it earlier. On Sept. 19, however, the committee tabled the vote, delaying it to the next committee meeting, scheduled for Oct. 22-23.
Although such a proposed change sounds small, it is not based on any new evidence. It would undo more than three decades of a prevention strategy that has nearly eliminated early childhood hepatitis B in the U.S.
While the committee regularly reviews vaccine guidance, nothing is business as usual about this meeting. In June 2025, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. disbanded the entire committee and handpicked new members. The committee has long-standing procedures to evaluate the evidence supporting the risks and benefits of a given vaccine, as well as other parameters of its use. But in this case, these procedures are not being followed.
 
Why the CDC adopted universal hepatitis B shots
Hepatitis B is a virus that infects liver cells, causing inflammation and damage. In adults, it is spread through blood and bodily fluids, which can happen through unprotected sex, contaminated needles or contact with open cuts or sores of someone who is carrying it.
The hepatitis B vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Before 1991, public health guidance recommended giving newborns and young children the hepatitis B vaccine only if they were at high risk of being infected — for example, if they were born to a mother infected with hepatitis B or living in a household with someone known to have hepatitis B.
That targeted plan failed. Tens of thousands of children were still infected each year.
Some newborns were exposed when their mothers weren’t properly screened or if their mothers got infected late in pregnancy. Children also became infected through household contacts or in child care settings by exposures as ordinary as shared toothbrushes or a bite that breaks the skin. Because hepatitis B can survive for a week on household surfaces, and many carriers are unaware they are infected, even babies and toddlers of uninfected mothers remained at risk.
Recognizing these gaps, in 1991 the CDC recommended hepatitis B vaccination for every child starting at birth, regardless of maternal risk.
 
Vaccinating at birth
The greatest danger for infants contracting hepatitis B is at birth, when contact with a mother’s blood can transmit the virus. Without preventive treatment or vaccination, 70% to 90% of infants born to infected mothers will become infected themselves, and 90% of those infections will become chronic. The infection in these children silently damages their liver, potentially leading to liver cancer and death.
About 80% of parents choose to follow the CDC’s guidance and vaccinate their babies at birth. If the CDC’s recommendations change to delaying the first dose to 1 month old, it would leave babies unprotected during this most vulnerable window, when infection is most likely to lead to chronic infection and silently damage the liver.
The hepatitis B vaccines used in the U.S. have an outstanding safety record. The only confirmed risk is an allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that occurs in roughly 1 in 600,000 doses, and no child has died from such a reaction. Extensive studies show no link to other serious conditions.
The current recommendations are designed to protect every child, including those who slip through gaps in maternal screening or encounter the virus in everyday life. A reversion to the ineffective risk-based approach threatens to erode this critical safety net.

Tamara Taylor has played softball, volleyball and basketball, but tackle football hits different — literally.

This report was originally published by The 19th.

“I just like to hit people and have fun,” said Taylor, 31, defensive lineman for Denver’s Mile High Blaze women’s tackle football team. “When I moved to Denver, that’s when I found out about football in general. … I wouldn’t change it for the world.”
Taylor and players like her are punting football’s traditional gender norms — tackle is for boys and men, flag is for girls and women — with a growing fan base across the country. And the sports world is taking notice: The Women’s Football Alliance (WFA) — home to the Blaze — became the first women’s tackle football league to secure a multiyear network deal with ESPN2, and the league’s national championship has been broadcast on the sports network for the last three years.
This year’s national championship brought in 969,000 total live viewers, making it the most-watched game on ESPN2 that day. The WFA’s St. Louis Slam took home the win against the DC Divas with a final score of 26-14.
The WFA has also announced expansion into Canada this year. The women’s tackle league has partnered with Cosmos Sports & Entertainment, a sports marketing firm based in Ontario, to identify cities in Canada that could host a team.

Lisa King, a former semi-professional soccer player, founded the WFA in 2009. The alliance is the oldest and largest women’s tackle football league in the world. With 60 teams across three divisions, the league has 12 professional teams.
King was interested in playing football throughout her childhood, but her parents denied her opportunity. After graduating from college, she jumped at the chance to play for a women’s tackle football team in Los Angeles. In founding the league, she wanted to use a similar structure as the soccer teams she had excelled in and bring it to women’s tackle football.
Ten years later, in 2019, Odessa Jenkins, a former player for the WFA, expanded opportunities by creating the Women’s National Football Conference (WNFC). Made up of 17 teams, the WNFC may be smaller in size, but has made an impact on the future of women in football by having a robust branding infrastructure in place to amplify the sport, including creative direction. Jenkins, who played and coached for the WFA’s Dallas Elite, aims to expand opportunities for women football players so that they get the level of recognition they deserve.
For the WNFC, this year marks the first time they have broadcast their national championship game on ESPN2. The matchup between the Texas Elite Spartans and Washington Prodigy came with a new high in digital engagement. The broadcast gained 150,000 championship viewers and more than 150,000 followers on Instagram, a 61% increase since 2024. The league’s TikTok account also doubled since last year, with over 46,000 followers.
And ideally, that recognition will come with pay for players — in the WNFC and the WFA. While neither league provides a salary for players, the WNFC does offer prize money to championship teams. With help from sponsorships by brands like Adidas, Dove and Riddell, the WNFC provided players on the championship team with $20,000. The WFA did not provide a monetary prize for the championship, but was able to cover some costs for players.
“It’s truly a pay-to-play type of situation because we’re not paying these wonderful athletes,” said Rob Sandlin, head coach of the Mile High Blaze, who noted that the financial strain and dedication required can be the biggest challenges for players new to the sport. “We try to be as brutally honest as possible when it comes to what to expect. The one thing that most rookies don’t quite understand is the level of dedication that’s required.”
Players must pay dues to remain part of the team, but payment doesn’t guarantee they’ll see time on the field.
“The physical aspects we can explain. The mental parts of the competition can be explained. The idea of how much work you have to put into it is probably the one thing that I get back from people that decide, ‘Yeah, I can’t do this,’ more than anything,” he said.
According to sports news site Marca, the average NFL salary in 2024 was about $3.2 million. While women don’t play for NFL teams, there has been growth in opportunities for women to be on staff. The NFL now has the most full-time women coaches of any professional men’s sports league, with 15 women holding coaching positions across departments.
While girls have access to flag football, a low-contact variant of tackle football, the sport traditionally separates based on gender as young athletes get older. Youth flag football has co-ed opportunities for players ranging from 5 to 17 years old. Tackle football more commonly has restrictions on girls and women playing, both during adolescence and adulthood.
Women’s flag football is seeing growth of its own, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics announcing that they will have women’s flag football teams competing for the first time. The NFL has also received bids for future investments in women’s professional flag football leagues this year.
Challenges aside, being in a high-contact sport as a woman has proven to be a unique and rewarding experience for these football players, whether they started playing as children with their siblings or discovered tackle as adults.
For Yolanda “YoYo” Searcy, football was etched in her life at a young age. Breaking with tradition, her Florida high school offered her a spot on the all-boys football team.
“The head coach coached all my siblings and was like, ‘I know what you can do,’” she said.
She declined and joined a school-sanctioned flag football team instead. Years later, she got her chance to play with other tackle-loving women as a linebacker with the Mile High Blaze.
Rosa Climaco, who has been an offensive lineman for the WNFC’s Washington Prodigy for three years, feels she could have benefited from finding football earlier. As someone interested in incorporating fitness into her lifestyle, Climaco finds football to be the perfect choice.
“One night scrolling on Instagram at 3 a.m., I found [WFA player] Lois Cook’s Instagram and just started going down the rabbit hole. I’m like, ‘Whoa, there is a legitimate football league that exists for women,’ and really the only regret I have is that I found it when I was 31,” she said.
Some players find that they have to balance the societal expectation for women to curb aggression with the demand for them to play rough to win.
“I personally think there’s caution tape around aggression even still in women’s football,” said Kourtney “KP” Purham, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy. “The idea for men obviously is to be aggressive at its most violent level. One of the things our coach says this year is ‘I support organized violence,’ but it’s like him selling that to us because women are taught not to be that way.”
“So, you’re now trying to navigate through what violence looks like in a sport that was designed for men to be violent and still how to be a lady in a violent sport,” Purham said.

Tapping into aggression comes more naturally to some of these athletes than others. While some players found tackle football to be a place where they could release that side of their personalities, others have had to embrace their aggressive side for the first time.
“A lot of the time for me, it was always, ‘You’re too loud, you’re too rough, you’re too this, you’re too that,’” said Washington Prodigy linebacker and captain Ramzeh Deen-sie.“I was still seeking a way to get out my aggression and just be who I am in my true, natural self.”
Deen-sie describes her transition from playing offense to playing defense as a perfect fit for her personality.
“It was just like, ‘OK, you want me to tackle whoever got the ball. You want me to put my shoulder pads through their chest and make sure they cannot come get you the next play,’” she said. “‘I can do that cause I’m already aggressive, I like to fight, I’m always on 10. I can do this.’”
Tonique’a Jackson, offensive lineman for the Washington Prodigy, has a much different relationship with aggression. For her, focusing on protecting her teammates has allowed her to move with more force on the field.
“I think trying to find that aggressive part of me, it took a really really long time. If it wasn’t being knocked over, if it wasn’t being tripped up, if it wasn’t being yelled at, it’s like you have to tap into the dog inside of you ’cause it’s either beat or be beaten, and that’s where my aggression comes from,” she said.
Outside of pushing her to explore her self-expression, playing football has also allowed Jackson to carry on a family legacy.
“In 2021, I lost my son to gun violence. He was very big in football, and [it was] something that was really, really important to him,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to not only stay connected to him but to also keep his dream alive because I felt like it was taken from him at such a short time in his life.”
Players say they’re satisfied with the growing recognition for their sport — and their representation in it.
“Just to see now with the progression of us being kind of everywhere, involved in coaching at the high school level, too, we’re getting a lot more fans out,” said Mile High Blaze quarterback Kimberly Santistevan. “Whether they know us directly or they’ve heard of us and they want to see us and check us out … the stands are getting fuller and fuller every year.”

The new film, “In the Wake of Justice Delayed,” follows five years in the families’ search for justice – in two cases of murder of Native women, one more recent murder in Palmer in 2019 and one decades ago in Point Hope in 1985 – and a diving into the interconnected grief and impacts of violence in the ongoing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, particularly women, in Alaska.
The film is set to premiere in Alaska with screenings in Anchorage on Sept. 21, and Homer on Sept. 27. It will air nationwide on PBS on Nov. 1. 
The documentary opens with the statement: “Native women and girls experience a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average,” by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Women are not just statistics. They are not just numbers,” said Alice Quannik Glenn, a journalist and podcast host from Utgiagvik featured in the film. “They’re real people that influence the other people around them. They influence their communities. So when one of us isn’t safe, it makes us all vulnerable.”
For the Miller family of Teller, pop 249, located about 70 miles outside of Nome, the once tight-knit family was devastated by the murder of their daughter, twin-sister, and mother Mingnuna Bobbi Jean Miller in Palmer in 2019. 
The film follows her twin sister Billi Jean Miller navigating the loss of her twin, as well as their mother, going through the pain of the subsequent five-year trial of her then-boyfriend charged with murder.   
“If I could push one thing, it’d be to know how to advocate for your family,” Miller says in the film. “When she died, I didn’t know how to advocate for her. I would have talked more to the police department or investigator.”
In a phone interview, Miller said sharing Bobbi’s story brings a mix of emotions, but she hopes it will inspire change in how domestic violence incidents – and Native women – are seen and addressed by law enforcement. 
“That shouldn’t have been her story,” she said. 
Miller said her twin sought help from the Palmer Police Department days before her death. “She wanted to come home and you know, they stigmatized her as just a Native woman on drugs, but she wasn’t on drugs. And that’s just the sad reality is that we’re treated differently,” she said. “They should have done their due diligence of helping her, if that’s their profession.”
For the Lane family of Point Hope, population 830, the grown children of Harriet Lane share their grief and outstanding questions of what happened to their mother. 
“I would like to see my mother rest in peace,” her son, Amos Lane said in the film. “Thirty years later, there are still unanswered questions that need to be addressed.”
In 1985, Harriet Lane was tortured, raped and murdered by three men in their community of Point Hope. 
“I don’t know what really happened. But that’s what people say happened,” Amos Lane said, and that it was never properly investigated. “So, that’s brutal.”
The family is continuing to grapple with the pain of her death, and calling for the case to be re-opened and investigated. “To this day, no one’s been charged with a murder,” he said. “Something is wrong.”
“No one should have to deal with this … without any resolution, without any closure, without any justice.” 
The film is the six year project of filmmaker and director Mary Katze and Affinity Films, a non-profit educational media production company based in Anchorage. 
“The story is about what it does to the psychological condition of people who are not acknowledged or believed or see any justice whatsoever,” Katze said in a phone interview. 
The film overlays the personal tragedies in the wider historical background of Alaska’s history of colonization, exploitation of natural resources and violence against Alaska Native communities, including slavery. During Russian colonization of Alaska beginning in the 18th century, the fur traders enslaved Ungangan peoples of the Aleutian Islands to force them to hunt for seals for the lucrative fur trade. The legacy of that violent period has been felt for generations, Tara Bourdukosky of St. Paul Island explains in the film, and continues to be felt today. 
“It is important to want to know, to talk about these things, to find out what actually happened in our past and how we got to be where we are today,” she said.
Katze said it was important to depict the generational trauma and legacies of violence felt by Alaska Native communities today. 
“I’ve been here 40 years, but I’ve never connected how that introduction to our (Western) culture, to our world, was so negative and traumatizing for so many people. And it’s important to understand that that’s the root base of families for generations. So there’s a distrust, and rightfully so, that they’re going to be treated right by this law enforcement. They have their own ways of dealing with murder in in their villages, and that was crushed when they brought in official law enforcement people,” she said. “So understanding that is a foundation to people and culture that has been violated so many times for so long is a big part of understanding the crime rate.”
Miller said she also hopes the film raises awareness about how domestic violence is addressed. “Victims of domestic violence are real people, and the system fails a lot of DV survivors and people that are lost to DV,” she said. “I just hope that there’s a really big impact, and that it brings on a really great change … because it is a crisis.”
Miller said going through the almost six year court process changed her, and sharing her experience in the film was emotional and difficult, but ultimately the family welcomed the verdict and feel they received justice.
“Because a part of me wants to push those feelings under the rug, and then a part of me is just really, really, extremely grateful that Bobbi is important… that she was a real human and that she was so loved,” she said. “I think we’re very fortunate that Bobbi’s story was told, and I think Bobbi’s very fortunate to have received justice for her story. And the process was hard because it was five, almost six years long.”
She said she wants the film to shed light on the Alaska Native families and communities now enduring the search for justice for murdered loved ones.
Currently the number of victims and unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people in Alaska is unknown. The non-profit Data for Indigenous Justice is putting together its own database of cases, and filed a public records request with the Alaska Department of Public Safety for the list of names of victims and cases investigated, and the state denied their request. 
“I just hope that the audience takes away that these are people that are very much loved, and they deserve better,” Miller said. 
Katze said she also hopes to see changes in the court system, and speedier trials.
“The target audience for this film is future jury members, lawyers, judges, and law enforcement…and then how important it is to support people that are brave enough to come forward,” she said. “And so I hope that Alaskans understand more of their own history, that they understand more on missing and murdered Alaska Native women.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IN-THE-WAKE-OF-JUSTICE-DELAYED-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-09-19 23:57:11.055753

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-unions-pension-connecticut-sun/,"CT's largest state employee union urged Gov. Ned Lamont to focus on overdue wage agreements for public-sector workers, not basketball.","Connecticut’s largest state employee union urged Gov. Ned Lamont late Friday to abandon talks of investing pension assets in the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun and focus on negotiating overdue wage agreements for public-sector workers.
“These members have put their hard-earned money into the pension fund, expecting a secure retirement, not for it to be used on a sports franchise that plays 18 games a year in Connecticut,” Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in a statement posted to its Facebook page. “We urge the governor to leave the distractions behind and focus on preserving public services and respecting the state employees who provide them every day.”
Lamont earlier this month endorsed the concept of investing pension assets to help keep the team in Connecticut, either at the Mohegan Sun casino, where it currently plays its home games, or at the recently renamed PeoplesBank Arena in downtown Hartford, formerly known as the XL Center.
The Associated Press reported in early August that a group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca reached a deal to buy the Sun from the Mohegan tribe for $325 million and move the team to Boston for the 2027 season.
Though the governor hasn’t said what amount Connecticut might invest to keep the team here, he did say he believes it could be a sound investment.
But Council 4, which represents more than one-quarter of state government’s unionized workforce — more than 12,000 workers across all agencies and departments — disagrees.
State employees “deserve the certainty of a dignified retirement, not the uncertainty of high-stakes investments in political pet projects,” the Facebook post continued. “Their pension contributions are the foundation of a secure retirement that workers have already earned. To use that money on a sports franchise is to gamble with the futures of those who have already sacrificed so much.”
State employee unions granted wage and benefit concessions twice in the decade of the 2010s to help close major budget deficits.
The Lamont administration did not respond to the Council 4 statement immediately after it posted Friday evening.
The Democratic governor’s efforts to retain the Connecticut Sun also has drawn fire from Republican legislative leaders, who this week called the potential investment risky and renewed a proposal for a professional board to oversee future use of pension funds.
Lamont has confirmed some discussions with tribal leaders regarding the Connecticut Sun but discussed few details publicly. The governor has said any infusion of state dollars into the sports franchise likely would be in conjunction with a private investor also interested in keeping the Sun here.
But the union wrote that Lamont has a more pressing, overdue issue to resolve.
Thirty-five bargaining units, representing nearly all unionized workers in state government excluding state police troopers, are working under wage agreements that expired June 30.
The Lamont administration, which has been trying to convince unions to scale back remote work policies established shortly after the coronavirus first struck Connecticut, hasn’t reached any tentative deals on raises yet.
And three units representing judicial staff and a fourth representing correction officers declared contract talks with the administration to be at an impasse earlier this summer. Three of the unions declaring impasse charged the Executive Branch hadn’t offered any raises to date, despite public statements from the governor that he intended to offer wage hikes to all unions.
“We urge the governor to leave the distractions behind and focus on preserving public services and respecting the state employees who provide them every day,” Council 4 added in its post.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/correctionpresser-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 22:56:52.838010

(Photo by Amanda Young/Toolik Field Station)After nearly four decades of connecting Arctic scientists to funding opportunities, research and education projects and each other, the Arctic Research Consortium of the United States held its last community meeting on Friday before a planned Sept. 30 shutdown.
The consortium, founded in 1988, is closing down after losing the National Science Foundation funding that was its major source of revenue.
Audrey Taylor, the organization’s executive director, used the online meeting to explain the ARCUS board’s shutdown recommendation, made this summer.
“The ARCUS that we know and love, what has been ARCUS for the last 35 years, doesn’t have a viable path forward at this time. And so that’s what we’re choosing to sunset,” Taylor said during the online meeting.
The consortium had been coping with reduced funding for the past few years and had already taken cost-cutting steps, like slashing its staff and moving to an entirely online workspace, she said.
The final blow was the Trump administration’s decision to end the National Science Foundation program that had provided most of the consortium’s funding, she said.
Rather than try to keep operating, the board determined that the best option was to close down in an orderly fashion that allows information to be properly archived and, wherever possible, services to be transferred to other management, Taylor said.
“Even though I think I speak on behalf of all of the board and staff that were heartbroken to take this step, we think it’s the most responsible path forward,” she said.
Wendy Warnick, who served as the executive director from 1992 to 2009, said the Trump policies have been particularly devastating.
“We’ve gone through difficult times in the past, but I think what’s happening now is unprecedented,” she said during the meeting. “I hope there’s a way to continue the work that ARCUS has done and to keep this amazing community moving forward as much as possible.”
The consortium had served as a hub for scientists from universities, private entities and public agencies in Alaska, the Lower 48 and internationally. It provided grants and financial support for research projects, supported early career scientists, supported an Indigenous Scholars Program, archived Arctic data and reports and provided other services.
Scientists who participated in ARCUS programs used Friday’s meeting to express gratitude for the past decades’ services.
Larry Hinzman, a former vice chancellor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who now serves as that university’s designated Arctic professor, said the consortium had made Arctic science more relevant and responsive to people who live in the region.
“In the early days, anything we did in Arctic research had to be justified from the importance of why the Arctic was important to the Lower 48. And I think ARCUS really helped us change that perception and made the Arctic important in its own right,” said Hinzman, who served as a science adviser to former President Joe Biden.
Helen Wiggins, who served as executive director from 2019 to 2024 and is now a board member, was a bit tearful as she lauded what she said was the “high standard of excellence” and “amazing level of professionalism” in the organization.
“It’s really about the people, it’s about the focus that I think we’ve had on authentic connections to each other, working together, supporting each other, caring about each other as people,” she said.
Some ARCUS functions will continue outside of the consortium structure.
The Sea Ice Prediction Network, a scientific collaboration that had been established by ARCUS in 2014, will continue operating as its own entity, said Brit Myers, the consortium’s strategic engagement director.
The network, which provides detailed information about ice conditions off Alaska and elsewhere in the Arctic, is supported by the Colorado-based National Snow and Ice Data Center.
The Sea Ice for Walrus Outlook, another scientific collaboration created by ARCUS, is also surviving. That network, which serves Alaska Native subsistence hunters and coastal communities, provides information on spring ice conditions in walrus habitat off Alaska. It is now operated by the Alaska Ocean Observing System, which also monitors harmful algal blooms, salmon habitat conditions and other aspects of Alaska’s marine system.
Both the NSIDC and AOOS are vulnerable to negative impacts from Trump administration policies, however.
The administration earlier this year ended a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data service that the NSIDC was using to track sea ice. The center now uses satellite-derived data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.
The administration has also proposed eliminating all funding for the U.S Integrated Ocean Observing System, of which AOOS is a part. That proposal is within the administration’s budget for NOAA, an agency that has already sustained deep cuts that reduced fisheries research, weather monitoring and other services.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NovemberSampling.jpg,,,2025-09-19 22:56:52.838010

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)This year’s Permanent Fund dividend will be $1,000, an amount set by the Alaska Legislature in House Bill 53, the state’s annual operating budget bill, earlier this year.
Ordinarily, lawmakers allocate an amount of money for the dividend, which makes individual payments dependent upon the number of recipients. 
The Alaska Department of Revenue then announces the final amount in September.
This year, lawmakers set a specific dividend amount, which turned the Alaska Department of Revenue’s fall announcement, released Friday, into an anticlimax.
Alaskans whose PFD applications were filed electronically, whose applications were approved as of Sept. 18, and who requested direct deposit, will begin to receive their payments Oct. 2. 
Those whose applications are approved by Oct. 13 will receive their dividends starting Oct. 23.
That includes people who applied for the dividend on paper forms or requested paper checks.
Paying a $1,000 dividend to all recipients was expected to cost $685.3 million, making it one of the largest single expenses in Alaska’s annual state budget.
Only the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development ($1.4 billion) and the Alaska Department of Health ($1.1 billion) are more expensive.
The 2026 dividend is expected to be larger, if lawmakers agree to spend from the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve. 
Since 2020, lawmakers have approved larger dividends in election years than in non-election years.
The Alaska Permanent Fund, an $83 billion state trust fund, is the largest source of general-purpose revenue for state services, paying for between 50-60% of state operations in an ordinary year. Oil revenue, by comparison, supplies only about a third of state revenue. 
Since 1982, a portion of the fund has been paid out to Alaskans in an annual dividend. The payment was set by formula until 2016, when lawmakers — facing severe budget shortfalls — began setting it by fiat. The formula remains in state law, but legislators are not obliged to follow it.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaks at an Aug. 4, 2025, news conference in her Anchorage office. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s three members of Congress differed on a series of votes Friday intended to keep the federal government funded past the end of the month, and avert a government shutdown.
Alaska’s sole U.S. House Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, voted in favor of a seven-week budget extension, but that measure died in the U.S. Senate when lawmakers were unable to garner the 60 votes needed to pass the U.S. House measure or an alternative proposed by Democratic members of the Senate.
U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was absent from both votes. U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted against both proposals.
“I voted against both measures as I felt that they were not serious (enough) to meet the situation that we are currently in today,” she said in a recording provided by her office.
The Republican-controlled House passed its stopgap funding bill 217-212, with one Democrat voting for it and two Republicans voting against it.
“The House did its job,” Begich said in a written statement afterward. “We passed a responsible, short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open and give Congress time to complete the appropriations process. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats chose obstruction over solutions, blocking this clean measure.”
Murkowski and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, voted against the House-passed plan, while Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pennsylvania, voted for it. Eight senators did not vote, and the measure died 44-48.
The Democratic counterproposal failed 47-45.
Murkowski said that counterproposal included “a Christmas list” of Democratic ideas, including items that would have reversed big parts of the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill Act” from earlier this year, which contained core tax cuts and spending policies of Trump’s second presidential term. Murkowski and Sullivan voted for that bill, which was later signed into law.
On the other side of the coin, Murkowski said the Republican plan failed to include an extension of subsidies for health care plans passed through the federal insurance marketplace, something that is critical for Alaskans. It also didn’t include additional funding for public broadcasting or opposition to President Donald Trump’s unilateral budget clawbacks, known as recissions.
“I’m going to be busy in the next 10 days, trying to build a level of consensus that keeps the government open, because there is no side — no Republican, no Democrat, the White House — nobody wins when there is a government shutdown,” she said.
“It’s possible that my proposal will equally annoy both sides, but maybe, just maybe, it will get the conversation going in a way that advances serious discussion and positive outcomes,” Murkowski said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC03285-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 21:56:42.963335

(Photo by Andrii Koval/Getty Images)Maryland’s promise is simple: We leave no one behind. But that promise is easier said than done. It must apply when families gather in houses of worship, when students walk into classrooms, when neighbors gather in community centers — and it must include Jewish Marylanders in our daily lives. Too often, today, it does not.
Sadly, prejudice still exists, and we must fight all forms of bigotry. Maryland’s 250,000 Jews (including myself) are living through a renewed and unnerving time of fear.
Every time Jews gather — for prayer, a holiday meal, or community service — security is on our minds. Congregations hire guards, install surveillance equipment and conduct drills. These steps are necessary, but costly, exhausting and heartbreaking. Worship should not come with a price tag or the constant fear of being targeted simply for being Jewish.
This anxiety is real. Not long ago, my dear friend Sara Milgrim and her boyfriend were murdered as they left the Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. Their deaths were part of a broader trend of rising antisemitism worldwide.
The numbers confirm what we feel. Jews make up only 2% of America’s population, yet according to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics, we are the targets of roughly 70% of all religion-based hate crimes. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) reports antisemitic incidents surged from 942 in 2015 to 9,354 in 2024 — an 893% increase in less than a decade.

In Maryland, we ranked fifth per capita for antisemitic incidents last year, with 356 reported — up 227% from 2022. The 2023 State of Maryland Hate Bias Report found religious-based incidents tripled from 2022 to 2023, with Jews making up 28% of all victims even though we are only 4% of the state’s population.
Antisemitism can arrive as physical attacks, but often it starts smaller — online, where allies stay silent. Recently, after I politely called out an antisemitic statement online, someone in Maryland wrote: “Well, people are getting disgusted by the horrific war crimes in Gaza perpetrated on tens of thousands of Palestinians by your notorious leader Netanyahu …”
While some may not realize it, this is deeply antisemitic. I am Jewish, but I am not Israeli. Netanyahu is not my leader. I, like most American Jews (and many Israelis), want hostages freed, the humanitarian situation in Gaza resolved and the war ended.
Should people around the world hate all Americans for Trump’s actions or all Russians for Putin’s? Of course not. Yet Jews are repeatedly scapegoated. Criticism of a government is legitimate; blaming all Jews for it is antisemitism
What happened on Oct. 7, 2023, is another reminder of why vigilance matters. That day’s Hamas terror attack in Israel was the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Even today, hostages remain in Gaza. For Jews everywhere, October 7 is now a day of grief and remembrance.
What can Maryland do? First, continue and strengthen security grants so faith and community institutions can keep people safe. Second, strengthen prosecution of hate crimes, ensuring bias-driven violence and harassment face serious consequences. Third, invest in public education campaigns that teach students and communities to recognize and reject antisemitism and other prejudice.
Marylanders who are not Jewish can act, too. Allyship starts with listening, speaking out against antisemitism and other prejudice, and refusing to let stereotypes or silence take root.
When my father was a child in Austria, he witnessed Hitler parade through Vienna. More than 100,000 cheered. Soon, most of our family was killed for being Jewish. We are blessed my father and his parents escaped to America. But we must ensure antisemitism does not come roaring back.
Albert Einstein said, “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch and do nothing.” One simple start: Recognize Jewish holidays — Rosh Hashanah (Sept. 22–24, 2025), Yom Kippur (Oct. 1–2), Sukkot (Oct. 6–13), October 7 (Day of Remembrance), Shemini Atzeret & Simchat Torah (Oct. 13–15) and Hanukkah (Dec. 14–22) — and avoid scheduling major civic events on those dates. Another is to speak up against hate whenever you see it.
Simple allyship across all marginalized groups sends a powerful message: Maryland leaves no one behind.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/antisemitism-700x445-1.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 20:57:41.192510

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Nearly 300,000 Marylanders who bought health insurance on the state’s Affordable Care Act Marketplace will see monthly health care costs jump next year, as state officials finalize premium rate increases for 2026.
The Maryland Insurance Administration announced the approval Friday of a 13.4% average premium rate increase for 2026, meaning individuals and households will have to pay hundreds more in health costs over next year.
While the approved rates are slightly better than what insurance companies initially asked for earlier this year, it’s still going to be a significant hike in health care costs for families already struggling to pay their bills.
“It’s going to hit patients hard,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society, noting that families are already struggling with other expenses. “That’s a significant increase for those who are not getting raises to keep up.”
The Maryland Insurance Administration said that the premium increases will be needed to offset the likely end of federal tax credits that help keep costs down for low- to middle-income Marylanders.
Health advocates, state officials brace for ‘sticker shock’ if ACA tax credits expire

Those tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year and health care advocates fear that people will drop their health care coverage because they can no longer afford their plans.
Matthew Celentano, executive director of the League of Life & Health Insurers of Maryland, agrees that the increase in premiums will reduce enrollment, which impacts costs for all policyholders, not just those covered through the Affordable Care Act.
“Frankly, it’s the healthier people that leave the market. The sick are more expensive, and to cover that cost we have to see higher premiums,” Celentano said.
The insurance administration added that rising medical and pharmaceutical costs also contributed to the higher premium rates.
For this year, insurance companies initially asked for a 17.1% premium increase, but after negotiations with the insurance administration, they landed on an average 13.4% increase for the 294,189 people who have individual ACA health care plans.
Still, that’s more than twice the rate of increase from last year, when individual ACA plan premiums rose an average of 6.2%. The lowest premium rate increase in recent history was in 2022, with just a 2.1% average increase across marketplace plans.
How much more plans will cost for Marylanders will vary based on a person’s insurance carrier, location and household income and size.
For a 40-year-old living in Baltimore with a silver plan, that person could see a monthly increase anywhere from $17 to $75, depending on their carrier, according to state estimates. A family of four in the same situation could see an increase of $57 to $258, on top of their current premiums.
The General Assembly approved funding this year that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the upcoming year, but those state subsidies are temporary fixes and plenty of people will still pay more each month for health care than they did this year, analysts say.
“With the pending expiration of the enhanced federal tax credits and with the state subsidy only able to partially replace the reduction, consumers may see sizable rate increases, much higher than in recent years,” Insurance Commissioner Marie Grant said in a written statement.
State officials, insurance companies and health advocates are urging Congress to extend premium tax credits, instead of letting them expire in December, though that window is closing.
“This can still be fixed,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of the Maryland Health Care for All coalition. “We really hope that they will do something … if Congress fails, it will hurt Marylanders.”

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland lost another 2,500 federal jobs in August, the second month in a row that the state has led the nation in federal job losses, according to numbers released Friday by the Maryland Department of Labor.
The August numbers brought the  total number of federal jobs lost in the state to 15,100 since January, when President Donald Trump took office and began his campaign to slash the size of the federal workforce. That year-to-date total is also the most in the U.S., the state said.
Maryland’s economy is heavily dependent on the federal workforce: An estimated 269,000 Maryland residents were employed by the federal government in 2023, according to a report by the state’s Labor Department, and there were 158,475 federal jobs located in the state that year.
The August job numbers count jobs located in the state, which means Maryland has lost almost 10% of its federal jobs since the start of the year.
Jake Pannell, a national business representative for the National Federation of Federal Employees, said many former workers have had to leave the region, and he worries about the lack of private-sector jobs for the variety of skillsets federal workers have.
“Many of these people have decades of experience. They’re overqualified for other positions,” Pannell said, adding that some federal workers will either have to accept “huge” pay cuts or undergo job re-entry programs — training them for jobs “they’re already greatly experienced at.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
And the federal job losses are only expected to continue when the September numbers come out. As part of the push to slash the federal workforce, federal employees were offered a deferred resignation option on Jan. 28 that would allow them to receive pay and benefits until Sept. 30.
“Workforce-wide” declines are expected to show up in the job losses at the end of September and through the end of the year as those jobs come off the books, according to a statement from the Office of Personnel Management.
Lawmakers this year created an emergency short-term loan program for laid-off federal workers, and the Labor Department has set up a page for former feds looking for work that includes a list of job recruiting events and career workshops.
“The states are doing everything they have the resources to do,” Pannell said. Many resources put forward by the state, such as unemployment insurance, are federally funded and are at risk of being cut, he added.
“Those resources aren’t going to be any better than they were before,” Pannell said.
The federal job cuts were the driving factor behind an overall loss of 3,200 jobs in Maryland for the month, which drove the state’s unemployment rate from 3.4% in July to 3.6% in August. Still, Maryland’s unemployment rate remained below the national average of 4.3% for the month.
The federal job cuts began on Trump’s first day back in office, when OPM issued a memo directing agencies to identify workers who were still in their probationary period, when it is easier for them to be fired. They continued in February, when Trump ordered reductions in force and agency reorganizations in line with recommendations of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE Service.
Since taking office, Trump has also unilaterally ended collective bargaining agreements with some federal labor unions and instituted a hiring freeze that has been extended through mid-October, among other actions. All told, about 97,000 federal jobs have been lost nationwide since January 2025, according to a Sept. 5 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“If you get rid of all these federal employees within the state of Maryland or in the D.C. metro area, where are they going to go? What are they going to do? Where are the jobs they could take?” Pannell asked.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-9.39.12 PM-1024x677.png,,,2025-09-19 20:57:41.192510

(FBI photo via X)The Montana Department of Environmental Quality will investigate the circumstances that led to a drug burn sickening a dozen employees at an animal shelter in Billings.
On Sept. 10, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was apparently burning methamphetamine in an incinerator primarily used by the City of Billings Animal Control Operation to burn dead animals.
The City of Billings owns and operates the incinerator, which is in the same building as the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter, a private nonprofit that leases space. The shelter is not operated by the City of Billings, but it does have contracts with the city.
The Billings Police Department has long used the incinerator for burning drugs, according to a Sept. 11 statement by the department.
In an emailed comment Friday, FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker said the agency “routinely uses outside facilities to conduct controlled drug evidence burns” and referred further questions to Billings city officials.
The City of Billings posted a statement on the police department’s Facebook page Thursday afternoon, saying they “regret the incident.” They called the burn an “authorized destruction of illegal drugs” in the statement.
A malfunction — a “negative pressure” issue, according to Billings police — forced meth smoke into the animal shelter on Sept. 10. It was not the first time smoke going into the animal shelter had been an issue, according to a statement from Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter Executive Director Triniti Halverson last week.
The DEQ’s authority in this matter is air quality concerns and the incineration equipment, agency spokesperson Jake Garcin wrote in an email on Thursday.
The permit for the incinerator was given on March 10, 2010, to Billings Animal Control from the DEQ. Prior to that date, the permit was held by the City of Billings Animal Shelter, the permit says.
The incinerator was initially built in 2003 and was permitted by the DEQ then. The permit stipulates that animal remains can be burned and what needs to be done if materials other than animal remains are being burned.
“The Billings Animal Control shall not incinerate/cremate any material other than animal remains and/or any corresponding container unless otherwise approved by the Department,” the permit reads. “Billings Animal Control shall provide written notice to the Department and obtain approval from the Department if material other than what would normally be termed animal remains, or its container, is to be incinerated.”
The DEQ was not informed of any specific burning activities, Garcin said. Since the original permit was issued, management of the incinerator has been done at the county level, with RiverStone Health approved to oversee compliance and submitting annual reports to the state, he added. 
According to a statement from RiverStone Health, doing business as the Yellowstone City-County Health Department, drugs previously incinerated at the facility had been pills and marijuana. RiverStone Health tracks what is being burned at that facility.
“Per our records, Health Department staff never witnessed or explicitly approved of the destruction of methamphetamine,” RiverStone CEO and Yellowstone City-County Health Officer Jonathan Forte wrote in a statement.
In addition to the Sept. 18 City of Billings press release, an emailed letter from RiverStone Health to the city’s animal control office said  an “alternate burn” was approved on Aug. 12, 2025.
“This letter serves as RiverStone Health’s approval for the City of Billings Animal Control Division to burn the materials summarized in the notification letter,” the email reads.
A second Aug. 12 letter posted on Facebook, from Animal Control to RiverStone, said the city had been contacted by the FBI for usage of the incinerator “for disposal of illegal drugs.”
Forte wrote RiverStone Health had “no knowledge” that methamphetamine was going to be burned on Sept. 10. Halverson, the animal shelter’s director, also said she had not been informed they were going to be burning methamphetamine in her statement. 
RiverStone Health, in a statement signed by Forte late Wednesday that it is “actively cooperating” with the DEQ and City of Billings. 
In an email accompanying Forte’s statement, RiverStone spokesperson Casey Page wrote, “Because this is an ongoing investigation, we are not available for further comment at this time.”
In a phone call, Page said the DEQ wants to let the investigation play out before commenting further on questions about what was being burned. The DEQ has only just begun its probe.
“Should DEQ determine that there was a violation, a letter would be issued to the City of Billings Animal Control and they would be allowed an opportunity to respond to that letter,” Garcin wrote. “After assessing all the information, including a response from the City of Billings Animal Control, DEQ would determine its intended path forward on the issue.”
The DEQ said it is also looking into whatever agreement allowed the FBI to burn meth feet from an animal shelter. 
“RiverStone Health is approved by DEQ to perform inspections and compliance oversight of minor sources that hold Montana Air Quality Permits in Yellowstone County, including cremation facilities,” Garcin wrote. “As part of its review of the incident, DEQ will look into the whole situation, including the ‘agreement’ referenced by Billings Animal Control.”
A Sept. 11 statement by the Billings Police Department, which runs the city’s animal control program, said the department and “partner agencies” have “long used the incinerator for narcotics destruction.” 
The regulatory role of the county health department in this situation is to “ensure that the burn occurs within a permitted facility, with an operational incinerator that has been inspected regularly,” Forte wrote.
It was unclear what drugs they were allowed to burn, what they weren’t allowed to burn and what exactly the agreement between Billings Police and Animal Control, the county health department, and any relevant federal agencies for burning drugs was.
The incinerator system in question operates from 1,400 to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit and is a closed-loop system, according to the RiverStone Health statement.
“The equipment utilized also contains specialized afterburners and filtration systems to reduce emissions into the community with no risk to the public’s health when functioning properly,” Forte wrote.
He also laid out what the Health Department’s role in this situation is.
“RiverStone Health is contracted with DEQ to provide local compliance inspections, air quality monitoring, approval of alternative burn permits, and quarterly reports of all activities to DEQ, as part of the Yellowstone Air Quality Control Program,” Forte wrote. “Billings Police Department and the City of Billings followed the established protocols for notifying RiverStone Health environmental health staff of the scheduled burn on September 10, 2025, and it was approved based on the information provided.”

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said states need to be “creative and innovative” in how they think about learning — and don’t need the bureaucracy of Washington, D.C., in the way.
McMahon made her remarks Friday at a roundtable with Gov. Greg Gianforte at Montana State University in Bozeman, the largest public university in the state.
At the roundtable, MSU students and representatives from industry talked about the importance of connecting education with the needs of the private sector and the benefits of the trades at Gallatin College.
“You guys probably know this statistic, but the fastest growing class of millionaires in the country are trade skills,” McMahon said. “So keep working.”
In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that private equity firms were investing in skilled trades and minting a new class of millionaires.
Gianforte, a Bozeman Republican and entrepreneur-turned-politician, said he wanted McMahon to see that Montana is leading the way in innovation. He touted more than 3,000 apprenticeships in various trades in Montana and “record low unemployment.”
The Governor’s Office announced on Friday an unemployment rate of 2.9% in August, “the eleventh straight month under 3% and over four consecutive years of unemployment at or below 3.4%, a new record.”
Gianforte, whose Gianforte Family Foundation made a $50 million donation to MSU to support cybersecurity, optics and photonics, and engineering, said a strong partnership between the private sector and higher education means better outcomes for students.
“That’s why we’ve made such a priority in our administration to align workforce with education, so that our students can have brighter futures and our economy continues to grow, so that people can pursue the American dream,” Gianforte said.
The governor said he appreciates McMahon’s interest in all 50 states to “understand what we face” and to “be a better partner” — and he’s seen progress on the partnership.

Republican President Donald Trump’s appointment of McMahon to head the Department of Education has been controversial and led to legal battles and protests.
Trump charged McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration during his first term and an executive with World Wrestling Entertainment, with shuttering the department in a bid to increase efficiency.
But some education groups and many Democrats argue the plan to dismantle the agency will hurt vulnerable students.
At the roundtable, McMahon said bureaucracy at the federal level — “we don’t hire teachers, we don’t buy books” — should not get in the way of “having more funds flow into the states to get to students.”
“The president certainly believes that every child should have access to a quality education,” McMahon said. “But we need to look at education differently.”
She said innovation means skills-based learning and understanding the needs of businesses. McMahon also said literacy is her top priority.
Courtney Johnson, of Johnson Metal Works in Bozeman, said the company is excited to have a pipeline of students from Gallatin College who meet their workforce needs.
She said some students make six figures right out of school.
“They have nicer trucks than us,” Johnson said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen, who also participated in the roundtable, said career training is a focus for the Office of Public Instruction too.
For example, she said OPI is sending interactive lesson plans and materials to help teachers teach photonics to elementary and middle school children.
“We are trying to make sure that kids get an early introduction and see these as options,” Hedalen said.
After the roundtable, Hedalen said children get excited about things like light sabers and robotics and lasers, and they excel with the hands-on learning.
She also pointed to one example of a disconnect between a federal regulation and the classroom.
She said Carl Perkins funds for Career and Technical Education can be used only for permanent items such as machinery or tools — but the money can’t be used to buy wood in shop class.
“Obviously, for the student to complete a project in wood shop, you need the lumber,” Hedalen said.
At the close of the discussion, MSU President Brock Tessman presented McMahon with a special pin.
He said the pins are reserved only for the executive team and “guests who’ve shown exemplary partnership and support for our university.”
“You’re our first external guest to receive this,” said Tessman, who took the helm of the flagship this summer.
Pointing to a painting of the headwaters of the Missouri River, Tessman said he thinks of MSU as the headwaters of the state’s future, rural America’s future and the future of the country.
“This is a special time for this campus,” Tessman said. “We’re bursting at the seams because of the innovation and the partnership that you learned a little bit about around this table.”



Hedalen: ‘Montana knows what’s best’
Superintendent of Public Instruction Susie Hedalen confirmed Friday federal funds for education in Montana remain intact.
Hedalen, who took office in January, also said she backs President Donald Trump’s vision of removing bureaucracy in the Department of Education and the ensuing staff reductions there.
“Montana knows what’s best for our students, and returning more control and funding directly to the state is a step in the right direction,” Hedalen said.

Hedalen spoke to the Daily Montanan following an education roundtable at Montana State University that included Gov. Greg Gianforte, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, and MSU President Brock Tessman.
Hedalen also said she spoke one-on-one with McMahon during her visit, and the secretary was engaged and interested to hear about the needs of Montana.
The superintendent said she shared the way Montana uses technology to ensure rural students have opportunities and discussed how to meet needs in a state with one-room schoolhouses.
She said she and McMahon both share an interest in early literacy as a priority.
Hedalen said McMahon understands the importance of special education and appreciates the work of paraprofessionals, and Hedalen said she herself does not anticipate changes to special education funding — which would take an act of Congress.
Hedalen also said she does not intend to buck the Trump administration’s cuts to education — but she is prepared to advocate for Montana schools and funding streams that are critical.
She said it’s important to peel out a layer of bureaucracy as McMahon has argued in order to focus on the needs of Montana and reduce red tape — filling out reports takes time, she said, and there’s a cost to it.
“I want our administrators to be able to be instructional leaders rather than filling out paperwork and reports,” Hedalen said.
She also said she’s advocating for other funding, such as state funding, to help English learners. Hedalen said Montana is one of the few states that doesn’t put money into English learning.
She said partnerships with business and industry can help when it comes to funding too.
Even with staff reductions at the department, Hedalen said Montana educators continue to have open lines of communication with their federal managers, and she herself will continue to advocate for students in the Treasure State.
“We know our schools and what they need best, especially with the rural nature and demographics of Montana,” Hedalen said.

After superintendent warns of harm to students from ""slurs, symbols, and discriminatory behavior,” parents and community members criticize administration for inaction.

Three weeks into the new school year, an 11-year-old Northfield middle school student has already faced multiple instances of harassment, according to his mother, who has reported the incidents to the school administration. 
And it’s just one instance in an apparent pattern of harassment and recent acts of hate across the Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
“My child has been harassed, going on three years now,” said the Northfield parent, who asked not to be identified for fear of her son facing retaliation in a community that residents and community leaders say is grappling with racism, harassment and bullying.
The parent said her son is a trans student who is trying to find his identity and just started attending middle school in Northfield. When he was in elementary school, his mother reported to administrators instances of another student harassing him, she said. But that information was never passed on to staff at the middle school, she said. The student who harassed the boy the past two years is now in his class again, and the harassment continues.
The harassment has included “a lot of misgendering” and being called  “a whore and a slut,” she said.
Superintendent Matthew Fedders from the Central Vermont Supervisory Union — which includes six schools in East Barre, Northfield, Washington and Williamstown — put out a letter on Sept. 12 to the community outlining a spike in hate in schools, without naming any particular incidents. 
In it, he pledged more support to students and families who are being harmed, and he called on families to “partner with us by discussing these issues openly at home and helping children understand the harm caused by slurs, symbols, and discriminatory behavior.”“These acts are unacceptable. While they may appear ‘isolated’ to some, their impact is not. For those directly targeted, they are painful reminders that hate can surface even in spaces that should be safe,” Fedders wrote.
Two days later, a group of anonymous residents responded with an open letter alleging the district is not just failing to take adequate measures to combat hate but “has given hate fertile soil in which to grow” by “consistently refusing” to name and denounce specific instances.
The letter states that students in the district have been called the N-word, trannies, sluts, whores and Black monkeys, and swastikas have been drawn on school buses and in restrooms. 
It further alleges that children of color have received “harsher discipline than their white peers” in the district and “disabled children have had their legal rights denied to them by the very educators who are tasked with upholding them,” the letter states. The letter did not provide specifics or evidence about the incidents. 
Fedders’ office said Thursday the superintendent was unable to respond to questions about the criticisms from the concerned residents outlined in the letter that VTDigger forwarded.
“He is also unable to comment on the letter from ‘Disappointed members of the Northfield community,’ as we have not yet received it,” Alysha Sickles, his executive assistant, wrote in an email.
Lack of follow up
The parent of the Northfield trans student, formerly a paraeducator in the Northfield school system, is among about two dozen residents who stand behind the unsigned community letter that has been shared via email and on social media. VTDigger has confirmed that at least five Northfield residents support the letter.
Also among them is Ryan Harlow, a Northfield resident and after-school administrator at the middle and high school, who has consistently spoken up at board meetings about the district’s inaction regarding harassment.
“The visible response from school leadership following each of these events has been mostly invisible from the perspective of non-administrator observers in the community and public,” reads the letter he submitted to the Paine Mountain School District that represents the towns of Northfield and Williamstown.
“As I have flagged before, there has been a throwing up of hands while administrators cite privacy concerns or scapegoat political figures on the national level. But there has been no apparent effort to ‘get out in front’ of issues in a way that would lead to community healing.  Individual discipline seems to happen at times, but teachable moments are habitually missed at the community level,” reads the letter he shared with VTDigger.
Although restrictions under the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevent him from discussing particular cases, Harlow, whose job puts him in close contact with students and parents, confirmed the Northfield parent and her son have been reporting negative incidents “for years” without adequate responses from Northfield schools. He said the Central Valley School District fails to consistently keep track of and document an affected student’s experiences and needs.
“It is exceedingly rare for me to be proactively given any heads up about a student’s disciplinary history, their history as a victim of hazing, harassment, and bullying,” he said. This extends to students who are on an Individualized Education Program, which outlines their special education service plans and relevant medical history. 
“This information siloing has been a point of frustration for others as well,” he added.
Northfield resident Kelly Murch said her family has been “personally impacted by these problems.” In her public comment, delivered remotely via video call at the Paine Mountain board meeting Sept. 17, she asked the superintendent and board to provide “guidance and resources” to better equip school staff to discuss these issues with students.
“I think it would be great if there were specific resources offered publicly from the district to families as well, who might be interested in starting anti racist work in their own household,” she said.
Principals in the six-school district did not respond immediately to requests for comment this week.
‘Words alone are not enough’
Both letters were discussed this week in the Paine Mountain School District’s board meeting, which is part of the consolidated Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
Dan Morris, the board’s chair, said in his statement that the board “does not accept or tolerate racist, bigoted, or hateful acts in our schools” and is “deeply troubled” by the recent instances of homophobia, transphobia and hate outlined in the anonymous residents’ letter. He said he believes communities need to hear a “clear statement” on “these very troubling developments.”
The instances of hate “have a very real negative impact,” he said, and the board is committed to “eradicating hateful, bigoted, and racist language and imagery from our buildings.”
“Students can’t learn when histories of widespread violence against their demographic group are displayed in front of them. They can’t learn when they are constantly getting the message that they are inferior and unwelcome. They can’t learn when they are made to constantly feel unsafe,” he said in the personal statement that he shared with VTDigger.
Staff outlined training and restorative justice circles conducted by schools in response to hate and harassment in an effort to “demonstrate the positive.” They said conversations this week have encouraged middle and high school students to discuss the kinds of harassment, bullying and negative language and actions they are experiencing, seeing or hearing about.
“It doesn’t feel to me like now is the time for restorative circles and education,” said Danielle Moffatt, a Paine Mountain board member. Students know when they use certain words and engage in bad behavior, she said, calling for stronger measures to dissuade them.
“Those words have been wrong since they were 5 and you’re in high school. So I’m thinking that the reason they’re doing it is because the consequence is not strong enough to disincentivize the behavior,” Moffatt said.
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, also called for action.
“While the superintendent’s letter names the problem, the Northfield community is right to point out that words alone are not enough,” Schultz said.
“If we are serious about protecting children, schools must move past statements and into action,” she said, centering the most impacted families and students in shaping solutions.
This includes clear accountability when harm happens, robust education about racism, antisemitism and ableism, and the hiring and retention of educators who reflect the diversity of our communities, she added.
The parent of the trans student said she has not seen that level of accountability nor a victim-centered approach for her son in past years. If anything, the opposite is true. 
“What they did in the elementary school was they had my child come up with a plan on how to support them in their gender identity,” she said.
After she informed the middle school about the past and the ongoing harassment her son continues to face, school leaders initiated a hazing, harassment and bullying investigation that determined this week the reported harassment was substantiated, she said.
“I hope that something will change,” the parent said. “There just needs to be more education and using these opportunities to have a teaching moment … to have school wide assemblies and say, ‘This is what’s happening right now.’”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA —  A key vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indefinitely postponed a controversial change to guidelines on administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborn babies, and altered long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed. 
The panel also voted to reverse a decision they made only yesterday that would have prevented updated guidelines on the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, from applying to children enrolled in the Vaccines for Children program. 
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

Vaccines for Children is a federal program which covers the cost of vaccines for more than half of American children. The decision to implement different standards for children enrolled in VFC caused confusion among top health officials as well as some committee members when it was introduced Thursday. 
Jason Goldman, the president of the American College of Physicians who also serves as a liaison to the committee, criticized Thursday’s vote, arguing that the changes were not backed by scientific evidence. 
“Would you consider that the second vote actually revealed the truth, that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is no associated harm?” Goldman asked the committee.
The committee’s reversal on Friday standardizes the updated MMRV vaccine recommendations for all children. If ACIP’s recommendations are approved by CDC officials, doctors will be required to administer separate MMR and varicella vaccines for all children under 4 years of age.
ACIP tables a rule delaying Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns
In what appeared to be another reversal, the panel shelved a resolution that sought to alter current CDC recommendations around hepatitis B vaccines for newborn children. 
The current three-dose series for hepatitis B, an incurable viral infection that attacks the liver, includes one vaccine administered to infants within 24 hours of birth, and subsequent booster shots given a month and six months after the initial dose. ACIP has been recommending a hepatitis B vaccine for all babies within a day of being born since 1991, which resulted in a 99% drop in serious infections between 1990 and 2019.
CDC panel opts against requiring COVID shot prescription, but wants greater emphasis on its risks

If ACIP members choose to implement the changes at a later meeting, official CDC guidelines will recommend that pediatricians delay administering the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until 30 days after birth for all children whose mothers test negative for the disease.
The panel did not provide any evidence indicating that delaying the vaccine improved children’s health, or that there were any widespread or serious instances of harm caused by administering hepatitis B vaccines to newborns. However, some ACIP members also cast doubt on the accuracy of data showing the shot is safe.
“I think that there are gaps in what we know and understand about the effects of hepatitis B, particularly on very young infants,” said Vicky Pebsworth, a committee member who is a registered nurse and who sits on the board of the National Vaccine Information Center, which advocates for vaccine exemptions. “I think that the conclusion that we know that it is safe is, perhaps, premature.” 
Dr. Adam Langer, who serves as the principal deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention, urged the panel to reconsider narrowing the recommendations.
“One of the primary reasons for recommending universal birth dose in the U.S. is to serve as a safety net for infants born to mothers with unknown test results,” Langer said during his presentation to the committee on Thursday. 
“To date, no country in the world has reverted from universal to selective birth dose recommendations,” he added.
The meeting, which was held at the CDC’s Chamblee campus, also inspired a demonstration organized by a group of former CDC workers, who dressed up as preventable diseases and waved signs to the passing cars while the meeting was underway. 
Cindy Weinbaum, who retired from the CDC in 2021, said Friday that it was commendable that the committee skipped a vote that would have recommended babies not be vaccinated for hepatitis B within a day after being born, which is the current standard. Jill Nolin/Georgia Recorder
Cindy Weinbaum, who spent about a decade of her career at the CDC in the division of viral hepatitis, said she commended the committee for deciding to table a vote that would have changed the recommendations for hepatitis B vaccinations.
“I think it’s really commendable, actually, that they delayed this vote because they do not know the implications of not recommending a birth dose of hepatitis B,” Weinbaum said.
“So that was a nod to their lack of understanding of vaccine programs, vaccine science and the importance of certain vaccinations for kids,” she added.
Weinbaum said the proposal’s appearance on the committee’s agenda reflects the “vaccine nihilism that the current administration is supporting.” She said the shot given to newborns within the first day of their life has found itself in the “cross hairs of the anti-vax movement.”
“It’s because here’s this newborn baby and you’re very vulnerable, and sticking it with a needle is kind of a scary thing,” she said. “They just don’t understand that it’s even more scary to get liver cancer, and that’s really what we want to prevent.”
ACIP moves to center vaccine harm
Though the committee did not implement some of its more controversial proposals, ACIP’s new members have signaled that they would like to place a greater focus on examples of vaccine harm and adverse outcomes in future policy proposals.
They have also rejected widely embraced data on vaccine safety, choosing instead to focus on isolated cases and dubious studies, including one paper claiming that rats exposed to the COVID-19 vaccine exhibited “autism-like behaviors” that was eventually retracted by the journal that published it.
Some ACIP members, including Robert Malone, also pushed back against guidelines that advise vaccinating young children and pregnant women, arguing that there is a lack of data proving definitively that vaccines are safe. 
“The default should be the assumption that there is no intervention in the infant and the pregnant woman with the vaccine unless there is definitive evidence of safety,” Malone said.
But Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at Dartmouth College who has served as a past committee member, pushed back against the argument that any medical intervention should be entirely risk-free.
“I just want to point out that it’s very, very difficult to prove the absence of harm, it’s simply not a practical objective,” Meissner said.
“I think it’s important for everyone to understand that no vaccine is 100% safe and no vaccine is 100% effective,” he added. “What’s important for the provider before administering a vaccine is to think about that particular patient and does the benefit of protection exceed any possible side effect from the vaccine.”

But in a conversation with reporters after the meeting, Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, signaled that the committee could revisit other vaccine recommendations in future meetings.
“I think we need to review vaccines, in general, from time to time,” Levi said. “It’s part of a good process. I don’t think that I need now to single out one vaccine or another. I think that, in general, it’s actually in the mission of ACIP. . . to actually review every vaccine.”

Photo credit: Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon with the Atlanta Civic Circle An immigration judge ordered Spanish-language journalist Mario Guevara to be deported on Friday despite a pending First Amendment case in federal court, setting off a frenzied attempt by his attorneys to stop the deportation from happening. 
Guevara was arrested earlier this summer while covering an anti-ICE protest in DeKalb County. His arrest has alarmed free speech advocates and attracted national attention. 
Friday’s ruling relies on a 2012 order stemming from Guevara’s request for asylum in 2005. While his request was initially denied, the case was administratively closed on appeal which paused deportation proceedings against Guevara indefinitely, but not permanently. The new order concluded that a previous immigration judge was prohibited from issuing Guevara bond in July due to that order.
Sandy Springs Democratic state Sen. Josh McLaurin, who is also an attorney, spoke against the immigration judge’s decision at a hastily called press conference Friday. 
“I want to make something clear. This is not a court in the traditional sense. This is not the judiciary with Senate-confirmed judges. The Board of Immigration Affairs is an executive agency with judges appointed by other executive officials that are responsible to the Trump administration. So make no mistake, this is not an isolated incident. This is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to silence and chill journalists for doing their jobs,” McLaurin said.
Following the immigration judge’s ruling this year, that 2012 deportation case was reopened, enabling Guevara’s deportation to now happen at any moment. 
Guevara’s attorneys had also been trying to argue in federal court that his continued detention by ICE is illegal on First Amendment grounds. Guevara’s legal team, led by the ACLU of Georgia, is seeking a restraining order preventing the federal government from deporting Guevara while this case is still pending in federal court. 
An emergency hearing was called in that case late Friday afternoon. While supporters had hoped a restraining order would be granted immediately, the judge instead requested attorneys on both sides to submit additional briefs by next week. It’s unclear if federal authorities will attempt to deport Guevara while the restraining order is still pending.
Guevara was arrested on June 14. He was transferred into ICE custody from the DeKalb County Jail under the terms of a controversial 2024 Georgia immigration law. 
Originally from El Salvador, Guevara has lived and worked legally in the United States for the past 20 years, according to his attorneys. He fled El Salvador for fear of political violence due to his work as a journalist. A longtime journalist for Spanish-language outlet Mundo Hispanico, he founded his own newsroom, MGNews, in 2024.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)MOBRIDGE — Days before the end of her term, the first woman elected chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said South Dakota leaders could learn something from their neighbors to the north.
Janet Alkire, a U.S. Air Force veteran, twice served as the tribe’s executive director before being elected as chairwoman in 2021. 
On Friday at the Grand River Resort near Mobridge, she told the South Dakota State-Tribal Relations Committee she’ll continue to work “from afar” for her people. 
The tribe of 16,000 members — 11,000 of whom live on the reservation that spans the border of North and South Dakota — will elect a chair, vice chair, and eight tribal council members Wednesday. 
Cabinet office with tribal leaders helps in North Dakota
Standing Rock members are “tri-citizens,” Alkire said, of the tribe, the states and the federal government. Because Standing Rock straddles two states, that means Alkire and other tribal leaders have six members of Congress to lobby.
“I’m pretty sure they’re tired of us, because we visit them a lot,” Alkire said.
Standing Rock leaders raise concerns about federal funding in meeting with ND, SD governors

On Friday, she told State-Tribal Relations Committee members that trust and relationships between the state and tribes hinge on frequent and respectful communication.
Committee member Scott Odenbach, the Republican House majority leader from Spearfish, wanted to know if he and his counterparts in state government could learn anything from North Dakota’s approach to working with tribes. 
Communication is the prime place for improvement with South Dakota, Alkire said. 
The state’s annual legislative sessions offer more opportunities to engage with lawmakers and pursue legislation than in North Dakota, where lawmakers meet every other year. But North Dakota has an Indian Affairs Commission that facilitates year-round connections.
“We actually meet with them quite often, because they’re coming out of the governor’s office and they’re right there at the Legislature, monitoring what’s going on,” Alkire said.
That commission includes North Dakota’s governor, the leaders of North Dakota’s tribes and three at-large members, two of whom must be Native American. The office also has an executive director and three other full-time staff members.
Standing Rock Council Member Cyril Archambault is the tribe’s North Dakota legislative liaison. He’s in frequent contact with commission members on legislation. The commission meets quarterly, holds at least two training sessions for tribes each year and holds spot events as needed.
South Dakota has similar entities, including the committee that met Friday and the Department of Tribal Relations, but Archambault said the comparison ends there.
“I don’t see much commitment from South Dakota. I’ll just be honest,” he said.
Standing Rock chair stresses building unity and infrastructure

Nola Taken Alive, another Standing Rock council member in attendance Friday, noted that her tribe has a healthy relationship with North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong.
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden has met with Standing Rock leaders, which Taken Alive said signaled potential improvement in relations.
His predecessor, current U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, had a strained relationship with tribes. Taken Alive attributed what she described as “friction” between Noem and tribes to “blatant disrespect, at times” from Noem. She pointed to comments Noem made last year about drug cartels allegedly operating on reservations. All nine tribal governments voted to ban Noem from their lands last year, for those comments and for saying Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“With Governor Armstrong, he’s always reaching out,” Taken Alive said of North Dakota’s leader. “That’s a healthy relationship.”
Federal outreach to continue
Alkire noted that Standing Rock and South Dakota’s other tribal nations face similar challenges with law enforcement and health care funding. Standing Rock needs 30 officers, for example, but only has funding enough for 10.
Changes to Medicare and Medicaid embedded in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed this summer by Congress, she said, will ripple across state and tribal borders.
“The tribes in South Dakota, all nine of them, realize that the relationships that we have with the state are very important,” Alkire said.
During a break in the committee meeting, Alkire told South Dakota Searchlight that the ascension of former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to Interior secretary offers another avenue to maximize the impact of tribal issues in Washington, D.C.
Standing Rock had a working relationship with Burgum, who intends to maintain the secretary’s Tribal Advisory Committee. Alkire represented the Great Plains for former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on her version of the committee.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also intends to maintain such a committee. That has Alkire hopeful, as well.
“That is the best line of communication,” she said. “I mean, they can communicate within their agencies, but you need to hear the perspective of the tribes.”
As for her plan after she leaves office, Alkire said it can be summed up in one word.
“Rest,” she said.

In a separate statement, the congresswoman said she supported the legislation because she “could not in good conscience vote to shut our government down, which would have made health care and food even more expensive for millions of Americans while handing the executive branch even more control over the nuts and bolts of the administrative apparatus.”
Republicans seized on the two-term congresswoman’s faux pas.
“As usual, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez talks a good game, but she’s not there for us when it counts,” said state Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, who has launched a campaign to unseat her in 2026. He is the minority leader of the Washington state Senate.

For North Carolinians, that means remembering that voters split tickets and that it’s routine for Democrats and Republicans to win statewide elections.
“North Carolina was purple before purple was a thing,” said Brinson Bell, who participated Friday in an online forum on trust in elections sponsored by the media organization Votebeat.
“We had one of the most conservative U.S. senators in Jesse Helms serving at the same time as one of the more progressive governors that North Carolina has ever had in Jim Hunt,” she said. “That just speaks to North Carolina voters.”
In 2020, when Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump, Republicans in every state were “grumpy” about elections, with Republicans in states where Trump narrowly lost a bit more unhappy than the rest, said Charles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT. At the same time, Democrats “believed election officials could do no wrong,” he said. 
“Distrust in elections is more likely to be driven by national rather than local events,” he said.

Polls found that Republicans’ confidence in election results increased after Trump won last year, 
But Seth Bluestein, a Republican on the three-member commission that runs elections in Philadelphia, said he feared that trust is not sustainable. 
Trump made unsupported claims last year about cheating in Philadelphia, which officials had to refute, Bluestein said. Once the polls closed and it was clear Trump won the state, those accusations stopped.
National leaders need to “tone down the rhetoric,” he said. 
“What I see is the national rhetoric from party leaders filtering down and being repeated by legislators, who are then trying to pass laws that will actually make election integrity worse, or make it harder for elections officials to run the elections at the county level,” Bluestein said. 
Brinson Bell noted that she started her tenure as North Carolina elections director after a ballot harvesting scandal in a congressional race and ended it with a candidate for state Supreme Court refusing to concede his narrow loss. She was talking about Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin, though she did not mention him by name.
“The transparency was there, the data was there, people could understand that this election had been conducted fairly, yet the candidate did not concede until May of 2025,” she said.
Griffin had challenged more than 60,000 votes, many because he claimed voters did not included required identification numbers on their voter registration forms. After the case meandered through state and federal courts, a federal district judge said the effort to throw out votes was unconstitutional and ordered Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat, be certified as the winner.
The US Department of Justice sued the Board of Elections this year over the missing voter registration identifiers. Elections officials are working to collect the numbers from voters. The DOJ and the state settled the case.
Though confidence in elections is rising, there are now more grassroots groups that profit from fomenting dissatisfaction than there were in 2020, Stewart said. 
“Even if confidence gets better, there’s the rest of the process that leads to the chaos that we observe,” Stewart said. “I think the situation is kind of dicey these days.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Voting-booths-Getty.jpg,,,2025-09-19 18:57:31.119591

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine led the country in enshrining the “right to food” in its state constitution. But the subjugation of the Wabanaki Nations has complicated that right for the original inhabitants of the land.
Anthony Sutton, assistant professor of Native American Programs and Cooperative Extension at the University of Maine, highlighted the differences between the traditional ways Indigenous communities use natural resources for food and cultural practices and the state’s current food sovereignty laws during his keynote speech at the Common Ground Fair in Unity on Friday.
“If we’re going to do the work of food sovereignty seriously, we need to recognize the rights that are allowed and the ones that aren’t,” said Sutton, who is also a faculty fellow of the university’s Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions. 
In 2021, Maine became the first state to establish a right to food in its state constitution when voters approved an amendment by referendum. This right is defined as the ability of all people to “grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being.” 
The amendment built on the state’s food sovereignty law passed in 2017, which lets municipalities adopt ordinances that exempt local and direct producer-to-consumer food sales from some state regulations. 
When Maine established these rights, Sutton said his Passamaquoddy mentor Ed Basset asked: What does this mean for tribal sustenance? 
The Wabanaki Nations – the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation – are treated differently than other federally recognized tribes. This is because of a 1980 land settlement agreement that has left them with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations.  
The Tribes have been pushing for legislative changes that recognize the Wabanaki Nations’ inherent rights to self-governance, economic development and resource management for years. But Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has so far rejected overhauling the agreement and instead approved some piecemeal adjustments on a case-by-case basis.
While Maine’s food freedom policies allow municipalities to manage local food businesses as a form of economic security, Sutton pointed out that the municipal distinction given to Wabanaki governments has had negative impacts. 
Candidates’ support signals tribal rights may be a top issue for Maine’s next governor

A 2022 Harvard Kennedy School study concluded that the Wabanaki Nations’ inability to self-govern has stunted economic growth, both their own and the state’s. 
Definitions are key when considering the impacts of state laws on tribal rights, Sutton said. 
From the state of Maine’s perspective, sustenance means, “if I grab a fish out of the Unity stream with my bare hands, because that’s how I fish,” Sutton said jokingly, “and I put it on my table for my family, that’s sustenance.”
But Sutton said that definition oversimplifies sustenance and avoids the complex ways people of different backgrounds access and use food. That way of defining sustenance also has consequences for the broader idea of food sovereignty.
“We talk about rights, and if we do that, we must talk about ways to ensure those rights are met across a range of geographies by everyone in substantive and meaningful ways,” Sutton said. 
For example, Maine’s food sovereignty legislation centers small-scale “traditional” farming.
“Whose notion of traditional are we using?” Sutton questioned. “If we’re going to go real tradition, we would start with our creation stories, the stories that not only teach us skills, but the values and knowledge needed for caretaking.”
Municipal boundaries are another complicating factor when assessing tribal sustenance under the state’s food freedom laws, Sutton said. 
While these policies support local food production within municipal boundaries, he explained that many Wabanaki foodways require movement that transcends such artificial boundaries. 
“It’s the movement between those places and the knowledge systems that makes growing and distributing corn possible today, though Maine’s sovereignty legislation isn’t particularly good at dealing with movement,” Sutton said. 
Land disposition also plays a role, as the Wabanaki Nations today have ownership over only a fraction of the land they originated. 
“In short, non-Indigenous management systems are not good at thinking about the future — five, 10, 20 years, maybe, sure,” Sutton said. “But in Wabanaki notions of care, we’re considering how we act shapes the future abilities for our grandchildren’s grandchildren to be in relation with the land and water, which is something that we can all benefit from.”
The Maine Legislature is expected to consider another omnibus tribal sovereignty bill when lawmakers reconvene in January. That legislation aims to adopt the recommendations from the task force the state convened to study the settlement act in 2019. Several suggestions included changes that would provide the Wabanaki Nations with the authority to restrict hunting and fishing by non-tribal citizens on tribal lands.
Another bill that will be up for debate would provide an exception to Penobscot Nation citizens to prohibitions against buying, selling or offering for sale certain wild animals and wild birds.
Lawmakers could also consider a proposal to send another constitutional amendment to the voters to establish the right to hunt and fish. The chambers couldn’t agree on it this year and the bill was ultimately carried over into the next session.

(Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix).TAMPA — Local government officials throughout Florida should be among the most interested viewers tuning into the Florida Channel next week when the House Select Committee on Property Taxes convenes for the first time in months in Tallahassee.
Some of those concerns — and excitement — about the still-unwritten plan promoted to substantially reduce or eliminate property taxes for Florida homeowners was discussed at the Tampa Tiger Bay meeting on Friday.
The challenge for local public officials debating a likely constitutional amendment to that effect on next year’s ballot in Florida is that no one knows exactly what the proposal will call for.
All options on the table
“Do you think the constitutional amendment will give the either/or, so if we do away with property taxes for homesteaded properties that at the same time we’ll have a choice to make on how that happens?” Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez asked state Rep. Berny Jacques (R-Seminole). “Or do you think the complete proposal includes some form of backfill?”
“It’s too early to say one way or another,” Jacques responded. “All options are on the table.”
Jacques went on to say that not every local government was the same in Florida in terms of how reliant they are on property taxes to fund essential services. He mentioned that Largo — a city he represents — brought in $239 million in revenues last fiscal year, with only $39 million from ad valorem property taxes. And only 23% of that revenue was from homestead properties.
“I think that they can do just fine, especially when they look under the hood and make key priorities about what’s necessary and what’s not.”
However, some municipalities and counties in Florida rely heavily on property taxes to run substantial parts of their  local governments.
“I look under the hood in the city of Tampa, our crime’s the lowest it’s been in decades,” said Tampa City Councilman Alan Clendenin. “This is not accidental, because we’ve had the investment in crime prevention in our police and our first responders.”
According to Tampa Mayor Jane Castor’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, every dollar of Tampa’s $380 million in property tax revenue is allocated to police and fire services.
Hillsborough County Commissioner Josh Wostal is a supporter of providing tax relief to owners of homesteaded properties in Florida. He floated his own proposal to get rid of all property taxes in the county and make up the loss of revenue by raising the sales tax in the county by 3.5%. He said the part of that could be subsidized by visitors.
“About 20-30% of people who [pay sales taxes] don’t even live here. That’s free money,” he said. “That’s relief for the fixed-income senior citizens and low-income citizens that own property that yes, while the more affluent people feel the sting of property taxes the most, the poor people and mixed-income citizens feel the burden the most because it’s ever increasing and inescapable. You can choose not to pay a sales tax. You cannot choose not to pay a property tax. “
However, state legislators working on the proposal say that a complete elimination of property taxes – while espoused on the campaign trail by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia – is not on the table.
“We can certainly talk about it,” said Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, co-chair of the select committee on property tax, told Spectrum News this week. “However, the direction’s that been given to me at this point in time is that the total elimination of property tax is not something that we would likely be putting forward in a constitutional amendment.”
‘A Tallahassee grab’?
No one on the panel was more critical of the proposal to reduce property taxes than Clendenin, a longtime Florida member of the Democratic National Committee. He said that it was absolutely critical that it fail at the ballot next year “because it will so adversely impact our first responders and the security and safety of our community and our state.”

But he received serious pushback by Jacques, who rejected Clendenin’s assertion that it was “a Tallahassee grab to seize power so that your local officials are no longer accountable to the citizens.”
“This idea that this is kind of a grab from the state — nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, it’s empowering to people of the state,” said Jacques, referring to the fact that it will be the voters who decide.
“If that’s a power grab, then I guess I don’t know the definition of that, because you’re giving the people the choice,” he added.
Meanwhile, Rep. Ryan Chamberlain, R-Belleview, like Jacques a member of the House committee assigned to figure out what the proposed amendment on property taxes will look like, proposed his own “Freedom 1,2,3” proposal to reporters earlier this week.
“There is a political risk for me or anyone else who rolls out an actual plan, because immediately, there’s going to be those who organize opposition,” Chamberlin said. “It’s easy to talk about doing something about property taxes without ever getting specific about doing anything about it. But I’m convinced that we must have a starting point.”
Although local officials are critical of the idea, Gov. DeSantis and CFO Ingoglia continue to campaign around the state for the proposal. In Ingoglia’s case, his DOGE auditing team has been scrutinizing spending by some of the state’s biggest cities and counties and calling them out for what he alleges is unnecessary spending.
This week alone, Ingoglia travelled to Jacksonville and Orange County, where he accused both of those local governments of “wasting” $200 million and $190 million, respectively (local officials disagreed). The CFO said its important to call those local officials out now, so that they don’t start complaining next year that a reduction in property taxes will force cuts would devastate public safety and other essential services.
The House Select Committee on Property Taxes is scheduled to meet Monday at noon in the Capitol.

This week, he was granted further reprieve from deportation, according to Kitson. (Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)Antonio Chairez Rios has spent the last three months living in Albuquerque with an ankle monitor, a daily reminder that at any moment he could be deported to Mexico amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push.
But yesterday, when he arrived for his scheduled check-in at the field office of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, agents instead removed the ankle monitor. Then they informed him that he only needed to check in once a year going forward, according to his lawyer Rebecca Kitson, instead of the appointments every month or so.
His emergence from the ICE field office marks at least the second time in several months that he’s dramatically avoided deportation. In early June, more than 100 protesters scheduled a last-minute demonstration outside the office, chanting “Keep Antonio here!” as Chairez Rios and his lawyer met with ICE agents.  
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

Kitson told Source New Mexico on Friday that the grandfather of two, who has lived in Albuquerque for 20 years, was spared deportation this time around due to last-minute legal wrangling that ensured a federal official reviewed Chairez Rios’ long-pending visa application. 
The review found that Chairez Rios was likely to succeed in his quest for a “T visa,” given to immigrants who suffered human trafficking, which meant he received deferred action on the government’s efforts to deport him and an approved work permit, Kitson said. 
The approvals occurred a day or two before his scheduled ICE visit, which Kitson called “a nail biter.” Chairez Rios spent this week getting his affairs in order, expecting that he would be deported, she said. That meant figuring out where he could live, how to transfer title for his truck and connecting his bank accounts to Mexico, she said. 
“ICE had indicated to us that it wasn’t their intention to remove him,” Kitson said. “But I don’t really know how much anybody can rely on that type of assertion these days, especially with the pressure to complete the quotas.”
New Mexico probation officers accused of referring ‘problem’ probationers to ICE for deportation

Kitson credited Chairez Rios for continuing to show up to ICE check-ins despite the threat of deportation, and she also reiterated her gratitude to the protesters who waited for three hours in the hot sun back in June. 
“It took a village to make it happen, but one starfish is back in the ocean, at least for now,” Kitson said. 
But she is troubled to think of how many people have been deported during ICE check-ins in Albuquerque, New Mexico and across the country. And she’s distressed that lawyers like her were required to force the government to do its job, including the timely review of visa applications. 
“It shouldn’t be that there’s a different standard for those who have representation. It shouldn’t be that someone is only released when there’s someone there to see it,” she said. “It makes me worry about everybody else.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9652-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 18:57:31.119591

State and county reviews found that Capt. Jason Gray was justified in his use of force in the incident that has resulted in a suspect facing attempted murder charges for firing on him.

File photo by K. Fiegenbaum/VTDigger.
A St. Johnsbury police captain who exchanged fire with a suspect won’t face any criminal charges in connection with the incident, according to the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. The suspect shot and injured the officer, who shot at the suspect but did not hit him.
The shooting that injured Capt. Jason Gray took place Dec. 13 in an apartment building in St. Johnsbury where police said they were investigating a report of domestic assault.
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office reviewed Gray’s use of force in firing back at the suspect, Scott Mason, and in a press release Thursday announced that they had determined that Gray’s actions were justified. 
“Under the totality of these circumstances,” the release stated, “both during and leading up to the shooting, an objectively reasonable officer in Captain Gray’s position would have concluded that there was no other reasonable alternative than the use of deadly force to prevent his death or serious bodily injury.”
Windham County State’s Attorney Steven Brown also declined to prosecute the case after completing his own independent review, according to the release.
Brown served as conflict counsel on behalf of the Caledonia County State’s Attorney’s Office in conducting the review.
About a day and a half following the shooting, police captured Mason in an apartment building near the one where the incident took place. 
Mason pleaded not guilty late last year to multiple charges, including attempted murder, in connection with the shooting of Gray. He remains in custody awaiting trial.
Gray had gone to Mason’s residence in a multi-unit apartment building as part of a domestic violence investigation. Gray walked up a flight of stairs with a fellow officer following him, according to a summary of the incident provided by the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. 
Seconds later, a round of pellet shots hit Gray as he was in the hallway. The other officer and the reported domestic violence victim fled, the summary stated. 
“Captain Gray then retreated behind a doorframe, drew his firearm, and peered down the hallway to locate the shooter when a second round of pellet shot hit Captain Gray,” according to the summary. 
“Simultaneously,” the summary added, “during this second round of pellet shots, Captain Gray discharged one bullet from his firearm in the direction of the shooter, but it did not strike the shooter or any other person.”
Gray then collapsed from his injuries, the summary stated, and while he was on the floor, he saw Mason carrying a shotgun. 
“Scott Mason approached Captain Gray and yelled, ‘get the [expletive] out,’ before fleeing the house through a second-floor window,” according to the summary. 
The search for Mason prompted the state to issue its first ever Blue Alert, which is used to inform the public of an ongoing search for someone suspected of injuring or killing a police officer.
After the shooting, an officer drove Gray by police car to Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital. Gray was later taken to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, for treatment of his extensive, but non-fatal injuries.
Gray has since retired from the St. Johnsbury police department, Town Manager Chad Whitehead said Friday in an email.
“The Town is pleased at the AG’s findings, and would not have expected any different outcome,” Whitehead added.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Most of the 308,662 Arkansans covered by the six health plans will not see the full rate increase thanks to subsidies offered by the federal Affordable Care Act, the release states. But those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t act to extend them. 
ACA marketplace insurers are increasing premiums by an average of 20% in 2026, according to an August KFF analysis.
Centene manages three of the six Arkansas health plans: QualChoice, QCA Health and Celtics Insurance. Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield manages the other three plans: Health Advantage, USAble Mutual and USAble HMO.
The two parent companies initially proposed raising their premiums by 54.4% and 25.5%, respectively. Sanders asked Arkansas Insurance Commissioner Alan McClain to reject the proposals, saying she did not want insurance companies to “take advantage of our people.”
In the news release, Sanders said she negotiated with the two parent companies to propose lower rate hikes, which will go into effect Jan. 1 with approval from interim Insurance Commissioner Jimmy Harris. McClain left the position Sept. 1 to take a consulting job.
Five of the six plans will have lower premium increases than initially projected, with the exception of QualChoice Life. On average, the six plans’ increases are 35.6% lower than initially projected, according to the press release.
“More work remains, but this is a good starting point and shows that when we stand up to insurance companies, we can win tangible benefits for the people of our state,” Sanders said in the news release.
Permanent extension of federal health care subsidies estimated to cost $350 billion

In Washington D.C., congressional Democrats have been urging Republicans to extend the enhanced tax credits for certain people who buy their health insurance through the ACA marketplace. Democrats included the tax credits in a 2021 COVID-19 relief package and extended them in 2022.
Concerns about prices spiking during the open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1, have brought the issue of extending the tax credits to the forefront ahead of the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline.
Passing an extension before Oct. 1 would decrease 2026 insurance premiums by 2.4% compared to previous projections, Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel wrote to federal lawmakers Thursday.
Permanently extending the tax credits would cost the government $350 billion over 10 years and insure 3.8 million more people, Swagel wrote.

New analysis reflects discussions with pro-feeding Wyoming, and the particulars will likely resemble the proposal expected soon from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. 
The post Feds provide peek at National Elk Refuge plan: Keep feeding bison, cut off elk at 7% CWD appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s no saying what exactly the National Elk Refuge will propose when it rolls out its long-awaited plan detailing how it will handle a deadly disease forecasted to drastically reduce Jackson Hole elk populations, crushing hunting opportunities in the process. 
But a new scientific analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey provides a first glimpse of likely components in the refuge’s “preferred” option for dealing with chronic wasting disease on a 25,000-acre federal property where thousands of elk have been fed and unnaturally bunched up since 1912. Specifically, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may roll out a proposal that calls for perpetual feeding of the Jackson Bison Herd, a species that’s immune to CWD. For the Jackson Elk Herd, meanwhile, feeding would continue until rates of always-lethal chronic wasting disease reach 7%. 
The USGS analysis predicts what will happen if the refuge opts for increased hunting and a 7% CWD threshold for determining when to stop feeding elk. By year 20 of CWD spreading in the herd, rates of the disease will reach an estimated 25%. The population will fall as a result, declining 26% to an estimated 8,100 animals. 
Paul Cross, the USGS research biologist who authored the report, described the particulars of so-called “Alternative D” as a “middle ground.” The assessment supplemented an earlier, broader analysis that uses science to help the National Elk Refuge chart the best path forward. 
Elk are fed in close quarters on the National Elk Refuge. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
Elk feeding began more than a century ago and has successfully increased winter survival and kept wapiti out of winter haylines, but the practice is considered antiquated, spreads disease, truncates migrations and poses an unprecedented threat to elk populations because of just-arrived CWD, which is always lethal. 
The particulars of “Alternative D” were selected based on discussions with wildlife managers, Cross said, naming the National Elk Refuge and Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 
Notably, Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish director, now oversees the poorly resourced Wildlife Refuge System that includes the National Elk Refuge. He was confirmed as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife director in early August. 
The forecast for “Alternative D” is more favorable for elk and elk hunters than if the National Elk Refuge goes with unchanged feeding. In the earlier analysis, that prognosis was for CWD to infect 35% of the Jackson Elk Herd, a rate that modeling predicts would slash the population by more than half, down to 5,200 animals.
The modeling assumed starting points of 11,000 elk and 1% CWD prevalence, both higher than the on-the-ground conditions today.
Elk fare similar under “Alternative D” to the herd’s prognosis if the refuge were to stop feeding cold turkey, the analysis shows. But the newly modeled scenario performs better in other respects, Cross said. 
“If you don’t feed, then [elk and bison] are going to be in other places more often,” Cross said. “That results in more calls to Wyoming Game and Fish, more complaints, more elk running around with volleyball nets on their head.”

The Fish and Wildlife Service did not authorize National Elk Refuge staff to give an interview for this story. 
It’s not entirely clear when the refuge will release its final Bison and Elk Management Plan, although its website says this fall. The current plan dates to 2007, and mostly hasn’t worked to achieve one of its major goals: reducing elk feeding by 50%. It’s also unclear how much the “preferred alternative” in the forthcoming environmental impact statement will differ from the “Alternative D” assessed by USGS. 
“They’ve changed multiple times already,” Cross said. “I don’t know if conversations are ongoing or not.” 
There are elements of “Alternative D” that the Wyoming Game and Fish Department has supported, said Brad Hovinga, who supervises the agency’s Jackson Region. 
“We were definitely supportive of continued feeding of bison,” Hovinga said.
There are still ongoing discussions about chronic wasting disease thresholds that could idle alfalfa trucks on the National Elk Refuge, Hovinga said. Game and Fish in a general sense will be pushing for an option that’s “more in line” with its state-level feedground management plan, he said. 
“That’s been our goal all along,” Hovinga said. 
Wyoming’s first-ever feedground plan, completed in 2024, does not compel reform or call for closing any feedgrounds, though it allows for halting feeding so long as consensus is reached with traditionally pro-feeding parties, like ranchers and hunting outfitters. 
The chronic wasting disease threshold for stopping elk feeding included in the recent analysis was not chosen arbitrarily, Cross said. The threshold was based on 2016 research. That study concluded that animals gathered on the National Elk Refuge will be pushed into a state of population decline once CWD prevalence in cows reaches 7%.

(Photo by Taylor Thomas/Nishnabotna Water Defenders)The eyes of dead fish and the message “know what you drink” adorn a new billboard near Avoca that urges Iowans to monitor nitrate levels in their water. 
The billboard is the first of several that the Nishnabotna Water Defenders, a nonprofit organization advocating for water quality in southwest Iowa, plan to install. 
The group formed in March 2025, a year after a couple hundred thousand gallons of fertilizer polluted the East Nishnabotna River and resulted in more than 750,000 dead fish. 
Terry Langan, co-president of the organization, said the purpose of the billboards is to inform locals of what is in their water, alert them to the free nitrate testing kits available from the Izaak Walton League of America and to key them in on other water quality issues in the region.

“We don’t want people to be poisoned; we don’t want people to have rising cancer rates,” Langan said. 
Izaak Walton League’s Nitrate Watch program equips citizens with nitrate test strips so they can test and report the levels in the streams around them. According to the citizen-scientist data, nitrate levels in the Nishnabotna rivers exceeded concentrations of 10 milligrams per liter at various points this year.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency holds that concentrations above 10 mg/L can cause adverse health effects, specifically an illness known as blue-baby syndrome, which can be fatal to infants.
Some research, however, has found that exposure at even lower levels could be linked to preterm birth and low birth weights and certain types of cancer. 
Water quality experts have said the high concentrations in the rivers this summer is linked to the heavy rains this year that followed years of drought conditions. Scientists in a comprehensive study of water quality in Polk County predicted that climate change will cause more of these weather patterns. 
The report, in correlation with a lawn watering ban in Des Moines and surrounding communities due to high nitrate concentrations in the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, have generated greater awareness of nitrate pollution in the water. 
“I think a lot of people operate under the assumption that everything was cool and the water is great, and it’s not,” Langan said. “That’s becoming very well known.” 
The report from Polk County pointed to agriculture as the primary contributor to nitrate pollution in the river. Langan said Iowans are “suffering” from the “corporate capture” the agricultural industry has in Iowa. 
Scott Kovarovics, the executive director at the Izaak Walton League of America, said in a press release that nitrate pollution is a “serious” problem in Iowa, but also in other communities across the country. 
“When local groups put up billboards along the highway, you know they are not just concerned— they’re fed up,” Kovarovics said of the Nishnabotna group’s actions.
In addition to the partnership with Izaak Walton League to provide nitrate testing kits, Langan said Nishnabotna Water Defenders is working to raise funds to provide testing kits for other water pollutants that are also impacting the watershed. 
The first billboard is located on U.S. Highway 59, outside of Avoca. Jodi Reese, Nishnabota Water Defender’s secretary, said the group chose that location because it’s near the Flying J gas station that spilled petroleum into the nearby West Nishnabotna River. 
Reese said the billboard highlights the “habitat death” of these spills and gets “people to think about what they’re drinking and what’s going on with their water.” 
The group’s next billboard is slated to go up near Shenandoah, which – prior to the heavy rains this summer – had been under water conservation orders for more than a year. That billboard is also near Clarinda, where an algal bloom in the Nodaway River recently contaminated the city’s water supply.
“This level of violence against the environment is not sustainable,” Langan said. “There are universal laws that are being violated. We’re going to end up – on this trajectory – in a wasteland.” 
Langan hopes the billboards can extend beyond the Nishnabotna watershed and pop up in communities across the state. The group is hosting an event Oct. 12 in Red Oak to raise funds for additional water testing materials and the billboard initiative. 
“There’s nothing more ubiquitous than water,” Langan said. “There’s nothing more sacred to us and more of a necessity – it literally runs through our bodies and through our neighborhoods.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press release Friday that two Taiwanese agricultural industry groups signed letters of intent to purchase Arkansas and U.S. products on the same day.
The Taiwan Feed Industry committed to purchasing 8.5 million metric tons of corn and corn products, while the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association will purchase 6.5 metric tons of soybeans.
“Today’s announcement is great news for Arkansas and especially our row crop farmers, who need all the assistance they can get right now,” Sanders said in the release.
Between 2025 and 2029, the Taiwanese groups will purchase agricultural products worth at least $5.56 billion from Arkansas and other American suppliers, the release said. Final prices will be negotiated by the importers themselves, the governor said, making it unclear how much would actually be paid.
Arkansans paying millions more in tariff costs compared to 2024

The announcement comes at a particularly precarious time for one of Arkansas’ largest industries, which is facing its worst period in years as a result of depressed crop commodity prices compounded by less-than-ideal weather and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.
Some state agriculture experts, such as the Agriculture Council of Arkansas and Democratic Senate hopeful and farmer Hallie Shoffner, are warning of impending disaster if more isn’t done to help farms — a third of which could shutter by next year without assistance, according to reporting from Talk Business and Politics. Farmer and GOP state Sen. Blake Johnson of Corning, has also said he believes 20-30% of farmers could close their doors by year’s end without help.
Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who chairs the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, has said he is working to get federal relief money for the state’s farmers.
Taiwan is already one of the largest markets for American and Arkansas agricultural products, according to Sanders’ release. Arkansas exported roughly $63.2 million to the country in 2024.

(Reader submitted photo)  State officials announced Friday they have begun testing seafood from the Tangipahoa River and Lake Pontchartrain to look for potential contamination after the explosion and fire at the Smitty’s Supply Inc. facility last month. 
The joint effort from the Wildlife and Fisheries, Health and Environmental Quality departments began Thursday, according to a LDEQ news release. Officials are collecting samples from various locations and analyzing them for heavy metals – such as arsenic, chromium, barium and lead – and petroleum-related hydrocarbons. Control samples of the same species will also be collected from Bayou Lacombe, an unaffected waterway. 
Results from Thursday’s testing are expected to take about two weeks, the agency said. A second round will follow in 60 days, with more testing planned if required to confirm whether the fish, shrimp and crabs are accumulating any toxins. 
The health department and partner agencies will use the results to assess any potential public health risks and determine if seafood consumption advisories are warranted.
Cleanup and decontamination efforts continue in Tangipahoa Parish nearly a month after petrochemical storage tanks exploded at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland and caused a fire that burned for about two weeks. The company processes and sells oils, lubricants, fluids and acids for various industrial and automotive applications.  
The explosion dispersed an oily residue onto neighboring homes, businesses and a nearby elementary school, while petrochemicals spilled into area waterways. An oil slick was visible on the surface of the Tangipahoa River, stretching roughly 45 miles south of the facility, LDEQ documents show.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published by the Valley News on Sept. 18.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION — After recent testing showed lower levels of toxic fumes in the air, the Hartford School Board has voted to reopen 12 classrooms that Hartford High School had discontinued using.
In June, air quality tests showed high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, better known as PCBs, in classrooms located in the high school’s B wing. Two of the 12 classrooms that were tested showed that the level of PCBs exceeded the “immediate action level” for occupation, as defined by state law.
Despite not being tested, the 10 other classrooms were closed, because they fit a similar profile to the two that exceeded the “immediate action level,” according to the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation. They were built with similar types of construction materials known to contain PCBs, including caulk.


PCBs were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1979 because they can cause damage to the body’s nervous, immune, reproductive and endocrine systems, among other health effects. In 2021, the state Legislature passed Act 74, which mandated testing in response to concerns about the legacy of toxic chemicals.

The affected rooms had previously been designated to be at the “school action level,” where students and educators are allowed to use the space, albeit for a limited amount of time each day.
The decision at Wednesday night’s meeting was based on results from testing in the classrooms at the start of the school year.
Hartford School District Director of Facilities Jonathan Garthwaite reported that all of the classrooms that were retested had lower levels of PCBs in the air than they did in June.
“We’ve had higher concentrations in the air” when there are higher humidity levels and temperatures, Garthwaite said during the School Board meeting.
“I think it is safe to say we can expect that trend to continue,” he said. “We have higher readings when it’s warmer and we have lower readings when it’s cooler.”
School Board member Kevin “Coach” Christie, who participated in the meeting remotely, asked Garthwaite how much control the district’s HVAC system has of keeping temperatures in classrooms at levels necessary to minimize the amount of PCBs in the air.
“Frankly … nobody knows what (the temperature) is,” Garthwaite said. “We know there’s a correlation between temperature, relative humidity and airborne concentration, but it’s a correlation.”
The high school is running its ventilation systems “as hard as we can,” he said. “We can’t do anymore.”
The high school does not have an air conditioning system, he added.
With the loss of 12 classrooms, Hartford School District administrators moved educators to different spaces. While they made it work, it was not ideal, Hartford High School Principal Nelson Fogg said during Wednesday night’s meeting. Teacher and student advisory groups had to share space.
There are also 21 teachers teaching who are forced to change classrooms throughout the day, which can impinge on instructional time.
“Our staff are getting to their rooms just as or after students are,” Fogg said. “Our teachers are telling us they’ve struggled to build a classroom community as they move from space to space.”
Before voting, School Board member Cathy Lemire asked Fogg if any staff members had approached him with concerns about reoccupying the 12 classrooms.
“Our staff has not suggested in any way that they’re concerned about moving back into them,” Fogg said. “I would suggest quite the opposite.”

The $6.4 million shooting range, which is open to the public, is the largest skeet and trap range in the state, said Tom Mullikin, director of the Department of Natural Resources, during a Friday ribbon cutting.
State officials put $750,000 into building the range, which has been under construction since 2022. Federal funds from the Wildlife Restoration Program, which is meant to preserve and manage wild animals, made up the remaining $5.7 million, according to the natural resources department.
The Boyd Foundation, a Columbia-based nonprofit, chipped in another $200,000 for equipment, according to the department.
The 780-acre range will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. Every 30 clay pigeons a person shoots will cost $5, according to the department.
The shooting range, about 25 miles south of Columbia, is meant to be a space for new shooters to learn the sport, for longtime marksmen to practice their skills, and for educational groups to take lessons, Mullikin said.
The nearby Wateree Shooting Range will transition to offering only sporting clays, making the new range the only one of the seven state-operated shooting ranges to offer skeet and trap shooting.
The new State Skeet and Trap Facility is also large enough to host the state’s skeet shooting tournament. High schoolers will use it for competitions, while middle schoolers will compete at Wateree.

Around 760 students across the state participate in the Department of Natural Resources’ Scholastic Clay Target Sports program, which culminates in championship tournaments, according to the agency.
Ten years ago, Maj. Billy Downer, who oversees the department’s staff operations, visited the property for a hunt with other veterans and military families.
While firing on the shooting range of what was then private property, he asked Michael Love, whose family had owned the property for years, “What are you going to do with this place?”
“I don’t know,” Love replied.
The two started brainstorming, and Love decided he wanted to see the property become a publicly owned shooting range, Downer said. The state bought the land the next year.
The Love family’s legacy will live on as part of the shooting range’s name, Downer said.
“I hope and pray we’re going to share that legacy with thousands of young people and other people in South Carolina that can enjoy this place,” Downer said.

Safety and community are foremost goals at the state’s shooting ranges, Mullikin said. He envisions the range as a place where parents can bring their children to learn the basics of handling and shooting guns. More experienced hunters will be able to give pointers to people who are just starting out, Mullikin said.
Trained range safety officers will monitor the eight fields, and a classroom will allow staff to teach 4H clubs, women’s hunting groups and any other organizations interested in learning the proper and safe way to handle guns, Mullikin said.
“We’ll create a culture where safety is normal, mentorship is normal, and stewardship is a standard,” Mullikin said.
For children, especially, the range represents a way of getting outdoors and finding a hobby not involving screens, said Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette.
The state’s public ranges are generally cheaper than private ranges, according to the natural resources department.
For example, the National Wild Turkey Federation charges $60 for 100 clays at its shooting facility in Edgefield.
“We need to get our kids out of the house and away from video games and putting their phones down and getting back to fishing and hunting and shooting,” Evette said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The University of Florida rescinded a retired professor’s emeritus status Friday, the university announced, over a Facebook post the evening of Charlie Kirk’s death that garnered social media backlash.
The university posted to social media Friday that “a retired faculty member who issued a post on social media that is raising concerns” had lost emeritus status. In a followup, the university did not confirm to the Phoenix who the professor was. The Gainesville Sun reported that it had confirmed the professor in question is retired UF law professor Jeffrey Harrison.
The professor, on his public Facebook profile, posted the night of the day Kirk was killed:
“There is a lot of commentary about Charlie Kirk. It’s not that complicated. He was a evil person spounting [sic] all kinds of hateful messages. I did not want him to die. I reserve that wish for Trump. But let’s face it, even members of the Gestapo and guards at the concentration camps had children. That does not make them heros [sic], nor does it make Charlie Kirk someone to be admired,” he continued.
The post was still up at the time the Phoenix started writing this story; however, before the story published and after a reporter messaged Harrison requesting an interview, his profile disappeared.
Scott Presler, a conservative activist with 2.3 million followers on X, posted to that social media platform Thursday calling for the professor to “lose any affiliation w/ UF & any current duties.”
Thursday, Harrison posted, “I am  getting a lot of hateful commentary about a recent post in which I did not want Charlie Kirk to die but it would be fine with me if Trump did. The latter sentiment i have seen on Facebook scores of times. This avalanche of hate came after someone reposted my original post on X. This leads me to ask if X has gone over, even more than Facebook, to Trumpers?” This post, too, is no longer publicly available.

According to UF regulations, the emeritus title is “conferred in recognition of meritorious service, and it shall entail continued campus courtesies … including parking, use of the library and recreation facilities, admission to athletics and cultural events, receipt of such publications as are sent to regular faculty members and members of the Alumni Association, participation in contract and grant endeavors, and participation in academic convocations.”
The retired professor is no longer listed on the Levin College of Law list of emeritus faculty.
Harrison wrote in The Gainesville Sun a guest column in 2022 that criticized UF administrators who “cowered” to Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Teachers among those answering to employers after Charlie Kirk social media posts

The rescinded emeritus status follows warnings from Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas and State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues promising accountability for educators “celebrating or excusing campus violence.”
The University of Miami, Florida Atlantic University, and now UF have been subject of attention regarding professors’ social media posts since Kirk’s death.
Various K-12 teachers have been under investigation, too, as the Phoenix previously reported.
Friday, Miami-Dade public schools confirmed to the Phoenix that it has received five allegations against employees for inappropriate conduct on social media or in the classroom related to Kirk’s death. Those allegations are under investigation, the district said.

Amber Herzmann, 44, who worked at hospitals in Clinton and West Des Moines, recently reached a settlement agreement on disciplinary charges brought by the Iowa Board of Nursing.
According to the board, Herzmann was working at an Iowa hospital in early 2024 when it was reported that she was stealing medications, including Oxycodone and fentanyl, from multiple patients.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Herzmann was criminally charged with nine felony counts of prohibited acts involving controlled substances and one count of tampering with records. Prosecutors, who allege she stole the medications from maternity patients at Clinton’s Mercy Hospital, recently agreed to a plea deal, although court records provide conflicting information as to the specifics.
Herzmann’s signed plea deal indicates she has pleaded guilty to a single count of tampering with records, while the court order related to that plea suggests she has pleaded guilty to one count each of tampering with records and prohibited acts. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 2, 2025.
That case is one of two pending criminal matters involving Herzmann. Twenty days before the criminal charges were filed in the Clinton County case, Herzmann was charged in Dallas County with 13 counts of felony prohibited acts and 13 counts of tampering with records. In that case, police allege that Herzmann, while working on the maternity floor at UnityPoint Health’s Methodist West Hospital in West Des Moines, stole fentanyl belonging to numerous patients.
Methodist West later reported a loss of 14 vials of fentanyl and two syringes of hydromorphone, classifying the loss as a potential theft, according to state records.
Dallas County prosecutors recently agreed to a plea deal in which Herzmann has pleaded guilty to two counts each of felony prohibited acts and tampering with records. She is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 3, 2025, one day after her sentencing in the Clinton County case.
In 2024, the Board of Nursing filed disciplinary charges against Herzmann as a result of the Dallas County thefts, but settled the matter in March of this year by requiring Herzmann to enroll in the Iowa Practitioner Health Program, which assists nurses with substance abuse issues.

Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) being removed from his House Appropriations Committee post after he voted against the bill. July 24, 2025 | Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs Michigan budget negotiations between the Republican-led House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate continue with 12 days left until a government shutdown, the heads of several state agencies are speaking out, warning that cuts within the House’s $78.5 billion proposal could severely impact their operations.
Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity Director Susan Corbin was among the latest to criticize the House’s budget, noting the proposal slashes 47% from the department’s current budget. 
“These drastic cuts to budget and staffing will create a ripple effect across Michigan’s economy and the programs people depend on.” Corbin said in a statement on Thursday. “Reductions in resources mean fewer protections and safety nets, fewer jobs, and fewer opportunities for hardworking Michiganders.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Corbin pointed to several potential impacts from the cuts in funding, including a loss of $130 million in federal spending authority for the unemployment insurance agency. She also warned of severe cuts to Michigan’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration and drastic reductions in funding for both Michigan Rehabilitation Services and the Bureau of Services for Blind Persons.
“In a time of national economic uncertainty brought on by federal tariffs, these cuts would not only cause immediate job losses, but they would also create long-term economic harm for families and businesses across the state,” Corbin said.
Col. James F. Grady II, director of the Michigan Department of State Police, said the $40.2 million in budget cuts and the equivalent of  297.5 full time positions for post operations.
In a statement, Grady said the cuts would leave the department without sufficient funding to run trooper recruit schools and would require them to examine ways to reduce spending, including cutting trooper overtime, implementing vehicle and mileage restrictions and enacting potential layoffs from the trooper recruit school that will graduate in November.
Grady also pointed to the end of funding for the Secure Cities Partnership, eliminating trooper assignment to high-crime areas, and dedicated crime data analytics and aviation support to cities around the state experiencing violent crime.
“At a time when law enforcement needs more support in terms of personnel and training, this budget takes a major step backward in defunding these priorities,” Grady said. “As budget negotiations continue, I hope they will reconsider their position and make public safety a priority.”
In addition to the state police’s concerns, Elizabeth Hertel, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said the $4.95 billion in proposed cuts would drastically affect their ability to protect the health, safety and security of Michigan families. 
With the House budget eliminating more than 1,600 full time equivalent positions in the department, Hertel said the proposal would lead to fewer child protective services workers investigating abuse and neglect complaints, fewer disease specialists responding to public health threats and fewer staffers investigating fraud, waste and abuse.
David Q. Worthams, the chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission warned that if the House’s budget becomes law, its staff would be cut by more than half, bringing back long delays and major backlogs in investigating civil rights complaints.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said the proposal is “simply irresponsible,” and would undermine EGLE’s ability to protect the state from pollution and potentially prompting the termination of critical public health and safety roles in areas like drinking water inspection, air quality permitting and contaminated site cleanup.
Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring said the proposal slashes the department’s total budget by a third, including significant cuts to food safety work, emergency response and preparedness and customer service operations.
“At a time when our federal partners are pushing for state governments to pick up the load, the House budget plan defunds our basic functions that help Michigan farmers continue operations, keep Michiganders safe from illness, and more,” Boring said.   
Despite heavy criticism, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, defended the House budget. 
“State department heads rushed out statements to protect the bureaucracies they run while House Republicans are standing with taxpayers,” Bollin said in a statement “Our priorities are simple and unambiguous: strengthen classrooms for every child, keep our communities safe, and fix Michigan roads. This budget stops funding failed programs and layers of bureaucracy that do not deliver results and returns those dollars to visible priorities that improve everyday life.”
However members of the Michigan Democratic Party have already begun targeting Republicans in vulnerable districts across the state over proposed cuts to police and health care. 
“Republicans in Lansing have again failed to stand up for the communities they represent,” House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said in a statement. “Through this door-to-door program, we’ll hold these lawmakers accountable and make sure every voter in their district knows where they stand – and it’s to kick Michiganders off their healthcare and defund the Michigan State Police.”
In addition to a door knocking campaign, the party has already begun running ads against state Reps. Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown), Rylee Linting (R-Grosse Ile Township), Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek), Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), Ron Robinson (R-Utica), Nancy DeBoer (R-Holland) Timmy Beson (R-Bay City) and Karl Bohnak (R-Deerton).

But Nevada is ineligible for the relief because the state already turned over the personal data to the feds. 
The other 21 states “offered declarations from their respective agency officials, who explain that having SNAP funds withheld is likely to require them to cut staffing and otherwise greatly reduce their ability to comply with their obligations under the SNAP Act to administer benefits, including, for example, the speed with which applications can be reviewed and required reports can be prepared,” the court’s ruling said.
“No such declaration, however, was filed by any official on behalf of the State of Nevada.”
As a result the “State of Nevada, as of August 12, 2025, had fully complied with the USDA’s request for SNAP data,” says the order issued Thursday by the Northern District of California. The motion from the attorneys general was filed on July 28.
More than 505,000 Nevadans, about 15% of the population, received SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, in 2024. The Trump administration says it intends to use the data to crack down on and investigate alleged fraud. 
But the effort raises concerns that agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement could use the information against individuals it seeks to deport.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to questions about the state’s decision to turn over the data, or whether he was aware Ford, who is challenging Lombardo for governor, intended to fight the effort. Ford’s office also did not respond.
The Division of Social Services official who oversees SNAP was out of the office Friday.
In March, Trump issued an executive order titled “Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” and ordered each state to provide SNAP applicant and recipient data, “including but not limited to personally identifiable information in the form of names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers.”
SNAP is a state-administered, federally-funded program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families. Personal information is provided to state and federal administrators in order to receive assistance, with an understanding that the information will only be used for SNAP purposes.
The data request places states in the position of breaching their agreement with recipients and applicants by providing the personal data or risking the loss of federal funding for the critical assistance.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1287472642-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 17:58:55.602074

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The U.S. secretary of Transportation is raising concerns about the state’s use of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs to select contractors for the Francis Scott Key Bridge replacement, saying such programs are potentially unconstitutional.
In a letter to state officials Thursday, Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that he has a “specific concern” over whether the state “intends to award contracts for the FSK Bridge project in a manner that relies on the race or sex of contractors.”
“Any reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions could introduce significant legal vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the management of the project,” Duffy wrote, adding that the administration believes “race- and sex-based ‘presumptions’ of disadvantage” in its own Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program are “unconstitutional.”
“As outlined in my ‘Follow the Law‘ letter of April 25, 2025, addressed to all recipients of DOT funding, the Equal Protection principles of the U.S. Constitution prohibit State and Federal governmental entities from discriminating on the basis of protected characteristics, including race and sex,” Duffy wrote. “Discrimination based on race is, has been, and will continue to be unlawful, except in rare circumstances.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D), in a statement, did not directly address Duffy’s remarks about race- and sex-conscious factors but instead answered his concerns about the “overall cost and schedule for completion” of the bridge. Initial projections from the state said it expects the Key Bridge to reopen in 2028 at a cost of $1.8 billion.
Loss of Key Bridge leads to more potholes, truck traffic in neighborhoods

“We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,” Moore said in his statement. “We anticipate the price estimation process to be finalized in the coming months and we will provide regular updates from the Maryland Department of Transportation about the project’s status.
“In the meantime, we will continue to pursue litigation and make substantial financial contributions by way of advance construction costs and insurance settlement dollars to keep the project moving,” he said.
Moore concluded by saying safety and “the sound stewardship of taxpayer dollars remain our top priority as we work to fully restore economic vitality—not only to the Port of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, but for the people across the country.”
Nine of Maryland’s 10 federal legislators noted that the federal commitment to covering the costs of the bridge replacement is set in law.
“The Key Bridge was bigger than Baltimore and Maryland – its collapse took away a vital transportation artery for the broader region and a gateway to the Port of Baltimore,” the lawmakers, all Democrats, wrote in a brief statement. “As we have with other major infrastructure disasters with nationwide implications, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to provide the full resources necessary for reconstruction to ensure it can be rebuilt as quickly and efficiently as possible.
The lawmakers said they would work with federal transportation officials to “keep delivering on this national priority and commitment.”
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the state’s sole Republican member of Congress and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, did not sign the letter.
In April, Duffy warned states that they could lose federal transportation funding for failing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or if they continued to use DEI policies.
“It shouldn’t be controversial – enforce our immigration rules, end anti-American DEI policies, and protect free speech,” Duffy wrote in that April letter. “These values reflect the priorities of the American people, and I will take action to ensure compliance.”

In June, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction against the federal policy. Maryland was part of a coalition of nearly two dozen states that sued to block the effort.
Maryland officials continue to press forward with a plan to remove the remains of the bridge that collapsed after a massive cargo ship struck a bridge support. The March 26, 2024, incident killed six people working on the bridge, stymied cargo vessels moving in and out of the Port of Baltimore and cut off a vital transportation artery carrying Interstate 695 over the Patapsco River.
Congress, under then President Joe Biden, approved a plan to cover 100% of the costs. Initial state estimates have placed those costs at around $1.8 billion.
“As you know, it is a high priority of the Trump Administration to build big beautiful new roads and bridges that enable people and products to move faster and more efficiently, thereby supporting economic growth and prosperity for America,” Duffy wrote in his Thursday letter to Maryland officials. “We want the replacement of the FSK Bridge to be a model of how to build quickly and cost effectively.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9617-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

John Sauer argued that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to revoke extended protections initially granted to Venezuelans under the Biden administration. Those protections extended Temporary Protected Status to one group of Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2023 and another who came in 2021. “The new order again displaces the Secretary's judgment on a matter committed to her unreviewable discretion by law, again impedes important immigration enforcement policies, and again ties up the Secretary's actions in protracted litigation that will effectively nullify them absent relief from this Court,” Sauer wrote. Former President Joe Biden granted TPS holders from Venezuela protections until October 2026. TPS is granted when a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, political instability or extreme natural disasters. The Trump administration has moved to end TPS status for several groups, including Venezuelans. The status protects immigrants from deportation and grants work permits.This is the second time in this legal battle the Trump administration is appealing to the high court to let it end protections for Venezuelans. In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to temporarily terminate TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans but the case continued in lower courts.",,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

Ned Lamont’s veto of a major housing bill, his phone pinged with messages from lawmakers who wanted him to sign the measure — including some who voted against House Bill 5002.
The text messages, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror through an open records request, show how affordable housing has become a political quagmire for the state’s Democrats. Lawmakers who voted for and against the bill told the CT Mirror there were some who voted no for political reasons, even though they agreed with what it did. 
Some took a risk and voted yes, although it may not play well in their districts. And Lamont, weighing a third term, vetoed it after prolonged concerns about the messaging from opponents and advice on how signing the bill would resonate in wealthy Fairfield County towns. 
Lamont seemed to know his decision to veto was making few in his party happy.
“Lots of Democratic legislative [sic] is very angry, may take a walk around the park in a few hours,” Lamont texted an ally on June 23, just a couple of hours after he vetoed House Bill 5002.
The bill was the most significant piece of housing legislation to cross the governor’s desk since he took office in 2019. It aimed to improve the affordability and accessibility of housing and tackled issues like zoning, transit-oriented development, parking, homelessness and fair rent commissions.
The text messages also confirm previous reporting by the CT Mirror showing that Lamont sought counsel in the days leading up to his veto. The messages include questions from Lamont to Fairfield County advisors about how the housing bill would play politically.
“I wanted to text you to encourage you to run for a third term!,” Steven Sheinberg, chair of the Fairfield Democratic Town Committee, texted the governor.
“On 5002. My download for you is that it is a net negative politically to you. For Democrats, too, especially in our county. It is our biggest weakness here,” Sheinberg continued. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Sheinberg said the governor should convene a blue ribbon panel to come up with recommendations on what to do about the housing crisis.
Lamont also asked Mark Boughton, the commissioner of the Department of Revenue Services and former longtime mayor of Danbury, what he thought about the housing bill for Danbury and the rest of Fairfield County.
“I don’t want to lose those towns …,” Boughton responded, mentioning towns like Ridgefield. “Our brand of being a moderate compassionate leader is a winning formula.” He then suggested a veto followed by a special session.
Reached by phone, Boughton declined to comment further.
“Although the Governor consulted current and former local elected leaders from both sides of the aisle on the housing bill, electoral politics did not play a role in the Governor’s decision on the original housing bill,” Lamont’s spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement. 
‘Difficult seats’
The bill passed with narrow margins — 84-67 in the House, and 20-15 in the Senate in May. To overturn a veto, each chamber has to approve a measure with a two-thirds vote, which would mean 101 votes in the House and 24 in the Senate.
Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, was among those who voted against the bill but later texted Lamont asking him to sign.
“Hey Governor, would you be willing to connect about the Housing bill?,” Leeper wrote on June 7. “As someone who voted no, I actually hope that you won’t veto it.”
Leeper said in a written statement that she wanted him to sign it, then have the legislature come back in special session to make changes. She also had concerns about the parking and assigned number of housing units.
Lamont and other state officials have expressed concerns about misinformation around the bill, and Lamont privately mentioned frustration about the group CT169Strong’s characterization of the bill. One of the group’s founders said previously that they “stand by everything we’ve said about what’s in the bill.”
“I shared with the Governor the same thing that I shared with my constituents, that a lot of what this bill aimed to achieve was mischaracterized and grounded in misinformation,” Leeper wrote in a statement to CT Mirror. “I believed there was a better way to fix this bill, rather than the long drawn out veto process.”
On June 6, Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton, texted the governor about the economic boon to Fairfield County that the housing bill could unlock. Hughes, who voted in favor of the bill, was attending an event on the economy with several other representatives and a member of the governor’s staff.
“We are so proud to stand up with you in signing this culmination of years of work in closing the economic and racial disparity in our state,” Hughes wrote. “We are all with you!”
She went on to list some of the people she was referencing, including Rep. Sarah Keitt, D-Fairfield, and Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport. Both of those legislators had voted against the bill.
Hughes said in an interview that the lawmakers talked at the event and agreed Lamont should sign the measure.
“We fully expected him to sign it because we had negotiated with his office a robust bill,”  Hughes said. “There were some members of our caucus that were for it, but in potentially difficult seats, so they didn’t vote for it.”
Keitt said in an interview that federal legislation has since changed the landscape of what a family can afford in Connecticut, and that the bill is needed now more than it was before.
“I have my personal opinions,” she said of her no vote. “I also have to weigh what my constituents want, and my constituents, at the time, didn’t support the bill.”
She said she believes “the numbers are different now,” and that people in her district may not be able to afford their housing in a few months.
“That calculation has changed for me, as well as the fact that we’ve made compromises to the housing bill,” she said.
In an interview, Steinberg said he was not in favor of the bill and that Hughes “doesn’t speak for me.” He supports affordable housing and wants to see legislation he can vote for, he added.
“I’ve always been a moderate and as you’re probably aware, despite my stated desire to pass better affordable housing legislation, I’ve actually been one of the leaders defeating some of the bad stuff in recent years,” Steinberg said.
Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, said in a statement that lawmakers have to balance the needs of their constituents with finding solutions to big problems.
“Many lawmakers may have opposed the bill based on concerns from their constituents but philosophically supported the approach and goals of the legislation,” Blanchard said. “Everyone can agree that we need to build more housing to meet demand, to lower housing costs and to provide shelter to the homeless, while also looking at different ways to achieve these goals.”
Lamont said when he announced the veto that he wanted to see legislation that got more local leadership on board. He had particular concerns with measures that would eliminate minimum off-street parking requirements for smaller apartment complexes and another that would require towns to plan and zone for a set number of units of housing.
The governor’s office has been in negotiations with legislative leadership for the past several weeks working on a new version of the bill. Officials hope to have a special session sometime next month.
“The Governor continues to meet and collaborate with legislative leaders, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as COST and CCM on finalizing a new draft of the housing bill,” said Blanchard, in a statement. “Addressing our housing needs in a way that builds on our state’s investment in housing, while also encouraging towns to join our efforts, has always been a priority for Governor Lamont.”
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate said they were aware some of their colleagues liked the legislation and voted against it.
“I think there are a variety of reasons why people vote no if they know that their vote isn’t necessary for it to pass,” said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said housing can be a tough political issue.
“Certainly there are political considerations when people are taking votes on bills, particularly around housing and zoning issues,” Rojas said. “But that doesn’t always necessarily mean that they don’t support the policy or want to see action be taken on it.”
‘A big chance’
On the flip side, lawmakers said, there were some who are in difficult districts for zoning reform, which typically include small towns or suburbs, who took a risk and voted for the bill.
“I hope that the gov doesn’t veto it since things do need to change, and a lot of us took a big chance and voted for it,” said Rep. Mary Welander, D-Orange, said in a text message to Lamont’s chief of staff ahead of the veto.
Welander said her district is complicated because there are four towns that all have very different needs. Part of her district includes Woodbridge, which has been subject to a lawsuit over its zoning practices for affordable housing.
“I had really hoped that this bill, 5002 would go through, because we had been assured that it would be signed by the governor, that a lot of us had been spent a lot of time and effort, either working on it, or, in my case, just going through it line by line, and learning as much as I could to ensure that I could vote on it in a way that wasn’t going to harm my towns,” Welander said in an interview.
Blanchard said in a statement that Welander is a “champion for her district,” and that the governor has worked with Democrats to achieve many things including tax cuts, investments in education and housing and reform to the child care system that aims to provide free care for some families. He also said Lamont did not take into consideration lawmakers’ reelection odds when making his decision. 
Many of those who took the risk, like Welander, are now left feeling politically vulnerable because of the veto, lawmakers said.
“They were anxious about voting for it,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London. “It was the morally correct thing to do, and then to have the governor veto it after they did the right thing, they were upset.”
Rep. Robin Comey, D-Branford, messaged the governor’s chief of staff Matthew Brokman on June 10.
“I’ll be very disappointed if the governor vetoes the housing bill,” Comey wrote. “I’m standing strong behind my vote and to have him veto would be devastating.”
Hughes said she gets backlash from her district over housing, but stands behind her vote.
“I always say to especially my freshman colleagues and people in difficult districts, ‘Defend your votes, explain it and educate your constituency,’” she said.
She and other lawmakers said the veto will make it difficult to trust Lamont’s office in future negotiations.
“It was the team, playing, working really well with each other, and he chose not to be part of the team,” Marx said.
“How can we go forward when now it has signaled to the opposition that all you’ve got to do is get people to call the governor’s office, certainly key people that he listens to, and he’ll veto it?” Hughes said. “It’s very, very difficult to move forward in good faith.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

Kevin Stitt's State of the State Address on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A panel has recommended all Oklahoma judges get a 17.58% salary hike.
If approved by lawmakers, the proposed hike recommended Tuesday by the Board of Judicial Compensation would mean the Oklahoma Supreme Court chief justice would earn $233,062 a year while district judges would make $197,189. 
Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman, who serves as president of the Oklahoma Judges Association, said the cost will be about $10 million. 
The state has 277 trial and appellate judges, Balkman said.
In a letter to state leaders, Ty Tyler, Board on Judicial Compensation chair, said the increase would make Oklahoma judicial salaries equivalent to the regional average.
Oklahoma ranks 45th in judicial pay, the letter said.
“It was the agreement of the board that the role of our judiciary is becoming even more important and to draw qualified candidates we needed to be competitive with the region,” said Lauren Brookey, a board member. 
The board meets to make recommendations for judicial compensation  every two years. Any change requires legislative approval.
The Board of Judicial Compensation in 2023 recommended a 17% hike in judicial salaries, Balkman said. 
In 2024, the Legislature approved a 7% hike for district judges. The following year, lawmakers approved a 7% hike for appellate court judges, Balkman said.
Oklahoma’s 27 district attorneys salaries are tied to the salaries of district judges, Balkman said. The $10 million does not include an increase for prosecutors, he said.
Statewide elected officials’ salaries were also once tied to judicial salaries, but they were decoupled about a decade ago.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson signed onto a letter released Friday that urges college leaders to defend free speech and “say no to the ‘Assassin’s Veto.’”
The letter led by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird cautions college officials against stifling free speech and debate in the name of protecting it through unfair or disproportionate security measures and costs.
“Particularly at this moment, it is critical our state institutions of higher learning serve as forums for robust debate from all perspectives,” Bird wrote in the letter addressed to “presidents and deans of universities and colleges.” “The campus should be the very place where the First Amendment rings loudest for all to hear.”
It follows the Iowa Board of Regents directing public universities to quickly investigate and censure, up to job termination, employees alleged to have posted comments celebrating the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In South Carolina, an opinion by Wilson cleared the way for college officials to fire employees for their posts.
Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University as he debated with students at an outside event.
“The tragedy of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected,” Bird said in a press release on the letter. “Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate.”
Citing 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, the letter stated that requiring “exorbitant” security fees for certain groups or events based on the content or viewpoint expressed by the speech can go against the First Amendment.
The letter cited the University of New Mexico’s attempt in 2023 to impose security fees totaling more than $5,000 on Turning Point USA — co-founded by Kirk — for an event that October hosted by the organization featuring former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines, an outspoken opponent of transgender women competing in women’s sports. A judge issued a preliminary injunction against the college for the fees, the letter stated.
University security policies must be transparent and nondiscriminatory, the letter stated, and security fees must be decided upon in a “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner.” Facility use policies should follow these rules as well, and ensuring the safety of eventgoers and participants should be handled by the institution rather than act as a barrier for certain types of speech, it added.
If universities advertise themselves as being open for public speech and debate, placing more scrutiny and fees on conservative speakers and events — or refusing to host them altogether — while not doing the same for politically neutral or liberal speakers could also violate state Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, the letter stated.
“Universities shouldn’t shut down free speech on campus because of potential danger but should be encouraging civil discourse and condemning political violence at all levels. I believe that’s what Charlie would have wanted, and it’s what I want as well,” Wilson wrote in a release about the letter.
Clemson fires 2 professors, Coastal Carolina fires 1 employee over social media posts

He signed on days after publicly releasing a letter to Clemson University President James Clements making clear that colleges in South Carolina could fire employees over their social media posts about Kirk’s death without risking prosecution. A South Carolina law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.”
While Wilson guaranteed in his letter Monday that the state wouldn’t pursue charges for terminating employees for social media posts he called “vile and incendiary,” he noted fired workers could still sue if they believe their free speech rights were violated.
At least four employees of South Carolina public colleges have been fired since Monday for posts about Kirk, including three at Clemson and one at Coastal Carolina.
In Bird’s letter, the attorneys general pledged to “fully and fairly investigate” colleges in their state for any complaint about unfair security fees or protocols.
Beyond Wilson, the 15 other attorneys general signing onto Bird’s letter are from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah.
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the letter stated. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.”

“Strengthening connections with local partners is a priority for Luther College, and we are excited by how this new partnership with the Decorah Community School District will deepen the relationship between our two organizations,” said Luther College President Brad Chamberlain in the release. “The partnership reflects a mutual commitment to invest in our local community by improving opportunities for students from Decorah to access and afford a Luther education.”
In order to qualify for preferred admission, the release stated Decorah High School students must remain in good standing with the district, have a minimum 3.25 grade-point average and complete Algebra II by the end of their junior year of high school.
In addition to institutional scholarships they may receive, students going down the preferred admission path will be eligible for the institution’s $500 Preferred Admission award.
Decorah high school students are “among the best in the nation,” Matthew Beatty, Luther College vice president for enrollment management, said in the release, and graduates who have chosen Luther to continue their education have thrived there.
Decorah Community School District Superintendent Tim Cronin said in the release the partnership is a new way of supporting students and their future goals.
“Many Decorah High School students already excel in academics, the arts and athletics, and this agreement provides them with the opportunity to continue their education at Luther while remaining connected to the community that has fostered their growth,” Cronin said in the release.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 20:42:48+00:00,CT Mirror,"As government shutdown looms, CT Dems push for ACA subsidies",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-democrats-government-shutdown/,"Despite a looming federal shutdown, Democrats are insisting that any short-term funding bill must address health care priorities.","Congress is in a stalemate over federal funding after a series of failed votes on Friday to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown. 
But Democrats, including Connecticut’s senators and representatives, aren’t backing off their insistence that any short-term funding bill must address health care priorities such as extending subsidies that would prevent sharp increases in insurance premiums.
The path forward is unclear, and the time crunch makes it more complicated. Congress is out of town all next week, and the House won’t return for votes until after the Sept. 30 deadline. The House originally had votes scheduled two days before the deadline, but GOP leadership cancelled them on Friday.If neither side budges, that raises the prospect of a shutdown.
Lawmakers in both chambers took the first steps on Friday to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, to keep government agencies running at current levels for a specific amount of time. A short-term deal buys them more time to negotiate a full-year spending package for fiscal year 2026.
The House first passed a bill to keep the government running through Nov. 21. It passed mostly along party lines, but because Republicans narrowly control the House and only needed a simple majority, they didn’t need to rely on Democratic votes. Only two Republicans opposed it, and one Democrat backed the GOP proposal. All five Democratic members of Connecticut’s House delegation voted against it.
But the bill failed once it made it to the Senate, along with a competing measure from Democrats. The Democratic version extended funding through Oct. 31 and included similar provisions, such as more funds for lawmaker security. But Democrats added a host of health care measures that have been nonstarters for Republicans.
In the Senate, Republicans need votes from at least seven Democratic senators to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance a bill. All but one Democrat opposed the GOP continuing resolution, and both of Connecticut’s senators voted no.
Even with the short window, lawmakers have more time to strike a deal. But in the event they can’t figure it out in the next two weeks, Congress could be heading toward a shutdown —the first since a partial shutdown that started late December 2018 and lasted about a month into January 2019, during President Donald Trump’s first term.
In the event of a shutdown, essential functions and services would continue, including the intelligence community and other national security agencies. The most immediate consequences would be furloughs of federal employees who work for various government agencies. Some workers, however, would be exempt, such as the military and most air traffic controllers. But they wouldn’t get paid during a shutdown and would receive back pay once government operations resumed.
The longer a shutdown lasts, the more it could interrupt other key services. Connecticut’s senators warned of risks to veterans’ affairs facilities, as well as Head Start child care centers, that might not be deemed essential, as they were in the past.
But given an already-diminished federal workforce, a shutdown this year brings new risks, including the slowdown of important grants to some programs and services.
“It’s not just the checks going out — someone has to approve the checks, release the grant money,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in an interview. “We’re in uncharted territory with so many of these agencies already hollowed out, so a shutdown could be a tipping point.”
Both parties are already pointing fingers. Republicans say they offered Democrats a “clean” extension of government funding for the next seven weeks. They called Democrats’ plan an “unserious” proposal with a hefty price tag.
“The kind of clean CR Republicans have put forward used to be something Democrats embraced. In fact, Democrats voted in favor of clean CRs no fewer than 13 times during the Biden administration,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. He called Democrats’ alternative a “fundamentally unserious proposal designed to appease Democrats’ liberal base.”
Democrats counter that the GOP won’t engage with them in bipartisan negotiations to keep the government running.
They are trying to exert the rare leverage they have in funding talks, with their main priority focused on extending Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, undoing health care provisions in the “big beautiful bill” including Medicaid cuts, and reining in the Trump administration from clawing back funding that Congress already approved.
Their version of a continuing resolution was crafted in part by U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who serves as the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., argued that having some guardrails in place for how the White House freezes or pulls back approved federal funding is especially important for Connecticut. He pointed to the administration’s decision to halt the state’s offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, which is 80% completed.
“We just want the president to obey the law. We don’t want insurance rates for people to go up, and unfortunately, Republicans are unwilling to stand up for families all across this country here and see insurance premiums go up and to stand up for the Constitution and rule of law,” Murphy told reporters on a call with Blumenthal after the Senate voted on the dueling government funding bills.
Republicans have resisted including the expiring subsidies in the bill and believe they can be addressed later in separate legislation. Democrats argue there’s an urgency to get it done now, particularly with open enrollment in the state-based exchanges beginning on Nov. 1.
“For everybody who is thinking, ‘Well, can’t they wait?’ No, we cannot wait to do these measures,” Blumenthal said on the call with reporters. “It is imperative that we act now. There is an urgency to people who are going to be sick, who need surgeries, who are undergoing treatment, and their health care insurance will be unaffordable to them because the premium tax credits will end or they will be off Medicaid.”
If the subsidies expire at the end of the year, states would have to pick up the costs. For Connecticut, officials could spend more than $295 million a year, according to a spokesperson with Access Health CT.
That prompted Gov. Ned Lamont and governors from 17 other states to call on congressional leaders to extend federal subsidies that help more people afford health coverage through state-based marketplaces. 
Nationally, if the subsidies expire at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projects that more than 4 million people would lose health care coverage over the next decade, citing increases in out-of-pocket expenses because of more costly premiums. Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
The expiration of enhanced tax credits will lead to out-of-pocket premiums for ACA marketplace enrollees increasing by an average of more than 75%. Insurers expect healthier enrollees would drop their coverage and cause premiums to then go up, according to a Peterson-KFF analysis.
If the government shuts down on Oct. 1, it’s unclear how long it would last and what negotiations between the parties would look like.
“I don’t know. It’s obviously very worrying that [Republicans] are not negotiating now,” Murphy said. “And I worry that Donald Trump has just decided that he’s not going to talk to Democrats. He’s going to use the White House to try to politically punish Democrats.”
Blumenthal echoed the sentiment that any talks could be at the whims of the president. “He could decide the day after the shutdown that he wants to negotiate and do what’s right for the country.”

The document said further that the system had to be “highly portable” as well as reliable, and would need the capability to notify Arkansas Capitol Police to an emergency from anywhere on the Capitol grounds, as well as the location where the system was triggered.
Samantha Boyd, Jester’s spokesperson, told the Advocate the motivation was “political violence just in general.” The system would be used by both Capitol staff and lawmakers.
“Schools are doing this too, so we thought it was time for us to kind of join in on that,” Boyd added.
Boyd said Jester’s office is negotiating with Centegix, which creates similar systems for governments and schools. Ron Self, the former director of safety, security and risk management for the Little Rock School District and head of security for the Little Rock-based Baldwin and Shell Construction Company, is on Centegix’s Customer Advisory Board.
The Atlanta-based firm was the only one to respond to June’s RFQ, Boyd said.
Boyd said while a timeline was being worked out as part of the negotiations, the goal was to have a system delivered as soon as possible.

Kirk was fatally shot Sept. 10 while speaking at a college campus in Utah. The House resolution came as President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to crack down on anti-Kirk rhetoric.


Here is how members of the Colorado delegation to the U.S. House voted on the resolution “Honoring the life and legacy of Charles ‘Charlie’ James Kirk“:

Lauren Boebert (R): Yes
Jeff Crank (R): Yes
Jason Crow (D): Yes
Diana DeGette (D): Present
Gave Evans (R): Yes
Jeff Hurd (R): Yes
Joe Neguse (D): Not voting
Brittany Pettersen (D): Present



Pettersen supports language in the resolution that condemns violence, but she “could not vote in favor of the partisan language” also included in the resolution, she said. She and other Democrats introduced a separate resolution “condemning all forms of political violence and rejecting rhetoric that dehumanizes or demonizes political opponents.” It highlighted the June assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, among other acts of political violence in recent years, including the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
“Instead of bringing us together to heal and stand together, unfortunately, Speaker Johnson was willing to play partisan games that continue to divide us,” Pettersen said in a statement, referring to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. “It is truly unimaginable that in this moment of tragedy, these cynical tactics were prioritized over the leadership that is so desperately needed right now in our country.”










“I went to war three times for this country to defend the Constitution and the rights of people to say things I may disagree with ... The right of every American to speak freely, peacefully organize, and protest is fundamental to who we are. After all, what is more American than the ability to question authority?


– U.S. Rep. Jason Crow


Crow voted in favor of the resolution a day after he gave a floor speech in the House condemning political violence and highlighting the importance of free speech. He said Trump, who blamed “the radical left” for Kirk’s death, is attacking the rights of those who disagree with him. 
“I went to war three times for this country to defend the Constitution and the rights of people to say things I may disagree with,” Crow, a former Army Ranger, said in his speech. “The right of every American to speak freely, peacefully organize, and protest is fundamental to who we are. After all, what is more American than the ability to question authority? Questioning authority is, in fact, our foundation and how we came about as a nation.”
DeGette said Congress “cannot condemn political violence only when it happens to one party,” adding that she supports the Democrat-led resolution condemning political violence because it “denounces all forms of political violence, regardless of the victim’s political affiliation.”
“However, I cannot vote yes on this resolution because it grossly misrepresents Charlie Kirk’s methods, views, and beliefs while citing Christian nationalist language,” DeGette said in a statement. “I will always condemn heinous acts of violence, but this resolution ignores the false and hateful rhetoric that was too often present in his debates.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers don’t agree to put medical health care worker compacts onto the agenda of the Oct. 1 special legislative session.
Under such compacts, participating states accept medical workers professionally licensed in other states, thus expanding the work force.
On Monday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services opened applications for states to apply for the $50 billion federal Rural Health Transformation Program, authorized by the so-called “big beautiful bill.”  According to guidelines released earlier this week for the fund by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, applicants who participate in interstate compacts for nurses, doctors, psychologists, emergency medical personnel and physician assistants will be given preference for rural hospital funding.
Hospital advocates, state officials navigating federal funding ‘uncertainty’

New Mexico is a member of just one interstate compact agreement — for nurses — and is one of only four states that participate in one or fewer compacts. Earlier this year, lawmakers passed seven compact agreements out of the state House with broad bipartisan support, and said they hoped doing so would address the worker shortage impacting patients and care across the state. All of the bills, however, stalled in the state Senate.
The federal agency will close initial applications for the Rural Health Transformation Fund on Nov. 5, leaving little time for lawmakers to approve New Mexico’s participation, according to Think New Mexico Executive Director Fred Nathan, whose organization previously lobbied for the medical compact legislation, and identified them as a key element of addressing the state’s health care worker shortages.
Choosing to bump the issue to the January session would put New Mexico at a disadvantage and possibly forfeit federal funds, he told Source NM.
“Legislative leaders have an opportunity to maximize federal support for New Mexico’s rural hospitals by working with the governor to include the health care worker compacts on the agenda for the Oct. 1 special session ” Nathan said.
Republican lawmakers have said they wanted to include health worker compacts as part of the agenda for the special session in a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier this week.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, shared a stage Friday to reflect on their friendship and bipartisan approach to governance, one they said they hope will serve as an example to a nation reeling from the assassination of rightwing commentator Charlie Kirk.
The pair spoke on stage at Notre Dame University for a talk titled “Pragmatism over Polarization,” which the university’s president, Rev. Robert Dowd, moderated. He asked both governors to offer their perspectives on political violence, polarization and bucking their own parties for the common good. 
As leader of the state that became the global epicenter of political violence last week, Cox has given news conferences viewed around the world since Kirk’s death. He’s used the news conferences to both update the public about the arrest of and allegations against suspect Tyler Robinson, but also to call for calm and disagreement without violence.
He reiterated that message Friday, saying “disagreeing better” is increasingly vital in a polarized nation under threat of political violence. 
“We can’t solve any of the greatest problems affecting our country if we all hate each other,” he said. 
Bomb threats target homes of state Democratic Senate and House leaders Wirth and Szczepanski

Lujan Grisham lamented the state of politics, which she said has coarsened to the point where violence or threats of violence are commonplace. Late last week, bomb threats against New Mexico Democratic legislative leaders  prompted the brief closure of a school and Santa Fe City Hall. 
“I don’t think there’s any elected official in America that hasn’t had a threat of violence or an absolute death threat made against them,” she said.
Cox and Lujan Grisham pointed to their friendship and working relationship as members of the Western Governor’s Association, which convened earlier this year in Santa Fe. Cox took over the helm of the organization from Lujan Grisham in Santa Fe. 
He pointed to the governors’ shared work on housing affordability last year as proof that respectful disagreement in politics is possible and worthwhile.
“We’re in this room, all these governors talking about it,” he said. “ And I truly wish every American could watch that, because you would be unable to tell who were the Republicans and who were the Democrats in that room, because this is a problem they were trying to solve together.”
Both said turning down the temperature despite the high stakes of politics requires deeper listening and debate that begins with mutual respect. Lujan Grisham said she would try to be better about that during his last year in office.
“Talk to someone who has different views than you do,” she said. “Listen to them. Be open minded, try to understand. I have not done enough of that in my political career, and so I’m dedicated to making time and room for more of that.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-19-at-11.15.33-AM-1024x574.png,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently charged nurse Christopher Bourbon, 40, of West Des Moines, with unethical conduct that is harmful or detrimental to the public, habitual intoxication or addiction to the use of drugs or alcohol, and violating a contract with the Iowa Professional Health Program.
According to the board, Bourbon entered the program, which helps nurses with substance-abuse and alcohol issues, in October 2023. In November 2024, the program allegedly  reported “significant noncompliance” with the program by Bourbon.
The board alleges Bourbon failed to provide breathalyzer tests on multiple occasions in September and October 2024, failed to provide signed releases for his worksite monitor, and failed to arrange for a required evaluation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the board, Bourbon was “informed by phone and in writing to stop practicing nursing” in October 2024, although GPS tracking showed that he was at his place of employment in early November 2024.
The board alleges that while working at an unspecified health clinic from August 2023 until July 2024, Bourbon was suspected of practicing nursing while impaired. According to the board, Bourbon was the only medical provider working at the clinic on the morning of July 15, 2024, when he appeared disheveled, unable to focus, and was alternately crying and “giggly.”
According to the board, “video surveillance footage showed (Bourbon) wobbling around” in the clinic and two patients he cared for that day later raised concerns about whether they had received the correct medication given Bourbon’s condition.
Another patient identified Bourbon’s behavior as abnormal and had Bourbon lock the doors and close the clinic, the board alleges. When the clinic owner arrived later that day, an open bottle of champagne was allegedly found in the clinic refrigerator.
To resolve the case, Bourbon recently agreed to a 12-month suspension of his nursing license and agreed to submit to a substance abuse evaluation. If his license is reinstated after 12 months, it will be placed on probationary status for two years and he will required to submit to chemical screening.
On Aug. 29, 2025, Bourbon was arrested and charged with second-offense drunken driving. He has yet to enter a plea in the case.
Home health nurse charged
In a separate matter, the Board of Nursing recently charged Tera Serbousek, 46, of Cedar Rapids, with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, or while impaired by the use of legitimately prescribed medications.
According to the board, Serbousek was employed by a home care agency called To The Rescue from October 2024 to December 2024. In November 2024, she allegedly showed up at a patient’s residence while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
According to the board, Serbousek was job-shadowing another nurse at the time. Serbousek allegedly passed out or fell asleep and an ambulance was summoned when the other nurse was unable to wake her.
Serbousek was allegedly admitted to the hospital and released the next day. She allegedly admitted to the agency staff that she had been drinking heavily the night before her shift. Board records indicate Serbousek was allowed to maintain her employment with the agency and in December 2024, a staff member at To The Rescue contacted her superiors to report concerns that Serbousek was again inebriated at work.
At the time, Serbousek was alleged to be speaking slowly, unable to remember her laptop password, and unable to recall how to complete medical charts. A subsequent test revealed the presence of alcohol in her system, the board alleges.
To settle the case, Serbousek recently agreed to a one-year suspension of her nursing license.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — The top vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Friday to change long-standing recommendations around COVID-19 vaccine access for children and adults, though a proposal to require prescriptions for all individuals seeking the shot narrowly failed.  
If approved by CDC leaders, the recommendations will also place a new emphasis on the risks of COVID-19 immunizations, despite the agency’s own data demonstrating that the vaccines are safe and effective for most people.
CDC vaccine panel votes to limit use of a childhood vaccine as COVID, hepatitis B decisions loom

The panel, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a wide range of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. Several states —including Georgia, where the CDC is headquartered — have codified the committee’s recommendations into law, allowing the panel to play a key role in determining which vaccines are covered by insurance companies and how accessible immunizations are for the general public.
Though the panel did not withdraw an existing CDC recommendation that individuals between the ages of six months and 64 years get vaccinated, it does require “an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination is most favorable for individuals who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and lowest for individuals who are not at increased risk.” For adults ages 65 and older, vaccine recommendations will be “based on individual decision-making.”
COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Americans is currently much lower than that of other immunizations, such as the flu shot. Only 13% of U.S. children were up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines as of April, according to Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, who serves as the acting chief medical officer for CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Among adults ages 65 and older, that number hovers around 43%.
The CDC’s own data showed that COVID-19 vaccines reduced serious disease and emergency department visits among both children and adults. But during Friday’s meeting, some ACIP officials questioned — without evidence — whether COVID-19 vaccines provide any advantage to the people who chose to get them.
“What is the true efficacy and true benefits that these vaccines provide?” said Retsef Levi, an ACIP member and professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Dr. Robert Malone, a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is also a biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise.” Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder.
Robert Malone, an ACIP member and biochemist who has previously said he views the label of anti-vaxxer as “high praise,” also pushed back on data showing that COVD-19 vaccines provide protection for the general public.
“There is no established correlative protection for COVID, period, full stop, and stop saying otherwise,” he said in a tense exchange with a fellow committee member.
Other public health officials criticized the proposed rule change that would have required patients to obtain a prescription before receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
“If we start asking for prescriptions for vaccines, which are again, a primary prevention public health strategy, we are going to overwhelm physicians’ offices,” said Dr. Amy Middleman, who serves as a liaison member on behalf of the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. “It’s alarming to me that for a primary preventive strategy, we are actually adding access concerns and barriers, rather than diminishing them.”
The committee also signaled that it would be open to revising current CDC recommendations that advise all pregnant Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Current guidelines state that mRNA vaccines are safe and effective for those who are pregnant, and can help provide immunity to babies under six months of age, who are too young to get vaccinated.
But Levi, who delivered a presentation that centered on the risks of COVID-19 vaccines, argued that current guidelines do not fully underscore the risk of adverse effects from vaccines.
“We decided not to bring it to a vote today, but we do hope that the FDA and the CDC will look much more carefully into this,” he said. “Most of us are extremely concerned about the safety and the lack of robust evidence for not only pregnant women, but their babies.”

Kennedy Jr.’s new vaccine advisers added confusion Friday to this fall’s COVID-19 vaccinations — declining to recommend them for anyone and leaving the choice up to those who want a shot.
Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year’s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.
In a series of votes, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn’t specifically recommend vaccination but said people could make individual decisions.
The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around the supposed risks of vaccination, an idea that received pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record.
And the divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.
Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics called the decision not to recommend vaccination “extraordinarily vague” and said it would have “real-time impacts on American children.”
He said the discussion involved clear efforts to “sow distrust” about vaccines.
“It was a very, very strange meeting,” O’Leary said.
The COVID-19 vaccines are not perfect, but CDC data shows they provide the strongest protection against severe infection and death, even if people still become infected. Likewise, people can get COVID-19 repeatedly as the virus continues to evolve.
Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots now are being updated yearly, but only about 44% of seniors and 13% of children were up-to-date on the coronavirus vaccinations last year, the CDC said.
“If you make a recommendation that people are simply not going to follow, I don’t think that’s wise,” said panelist Dr. Cody Meissner of Dartmouth College.
Another question concerns a very rare side effect mostly in young men — a kind of heart inflammation called myocarditis — that was discovered in the early days of vaccination in 2021. A scientist studying whether people with certain genes are uniquely susceptible to that risk told the panel the Trump administration had canceled his grant before the research could be finished.
The panel took up COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus remains a public health threat. CDC data released in June shows the virus resulted in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations last fall and winter. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and young children — especially those who were unvaccinated.
Worried about access, leading medical groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics already have issued recommendations that the vaccines be available to anyone age 6 months and older who wants one — including pregnant women — just like in prior years.
Several states have announced policies to try to assure that access regardless of Friday’s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America’s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continuing covering the shots through 2026.
The panel opened the second day of its meeting with continued confusion over a question it left hanging Thursday: whether to end a longstanding CDC recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated at birth against a liver virus, hepatitis B.
[RELATED: RFK, Jr.’s advisory panel recommends new restrictions on MMRV vaccines]
The panel had been considering whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination — something doctors and parents already can choose to do. But amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply, the advisers decided Friday to postpone that decision.
On Thursday, the panel recommended a new restriction on another childhood vaccine.
They recommended that for children under 4, their first dose of protection against MMR — measles, mumps and rubella — and chickenpox should be in separate shots, not a combination version known as MMRV. Since 2009, the CDC has said it prefers separate shots for initial doses of those vaccines and 85% of toddlers already do.
On Friday, the committee also recommended that the government’s Vaccines for Children program — which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids — align its guidance with that narrower MMRV usage.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25261599128177-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority announced Thursday that marshlands in Cameron Parish received $122 million in restoration dollars from Deepwater Horizon settlement funds. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Cameron Parish will receive a sizable grant to help rebuild its vanishing marshlands, state officials announced. 
The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion. 
The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey. 
The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water. 
“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release. 
Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed. 
Estimates of the project’s total cost come to about $260 million, according to the CPRA. A previous $28.6 million grant was put toward planning costs with any remainder to be rolled over for construction and maintenance. 
“The Calcasieu-Sabine project reflects the kind of large-scale, science-based restoration prioritized in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said.. “We’re now moving from planning to action in one of the most vulnerable areas of our coast, where this investment will make a measurable difference.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_9101-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 16:57:28.993893

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Enrollment at the University of New Orleans is down about 800 students this fall as the university deals with an ongoing fiscal crisis from a years-long enrollment slump. 
There are 5,670 students enrolled at the university this semester, UNO President Kathy Johnson said in a campuswide email  this week. The count is down about 12% from a year ago. 
“This number is lower than we’d hoped, yet understandable given the challenges we’ve experienced over the course of the past year,” Johnson said. “The future remains incredibly bright as we prepare to transition back to the LSU System with a realigned budget.” 
The decrease in enrollment at UNO has spanned two decades. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. For several years before Johnson took over the university in 2023, university officials did not align spending with enrollment. The school faced a $30 million budget shortfall  last fiscal year and implemented a spending freeze, layoffs and staff furloughs in an attempt to make ends meet. 
The loss of students means UNO will bring in about $1 million less in revenue than anticipated, though Johnson said the university will not reduce its budget. Johnson said UNO would be “judicious” in replacing students and asked faculty and staff to refrain from purchases unless they are essentially or paid for with external funds. 
The enrollment decline comes as the school is preparing to transition back to the LSU System. The Louisiana Legislature passed a bill earlier this year to initiate the transfer, which would undo lawmakers’ decision to move the university from the LSU System to the University of Louisiana System 14 years ago. 
The first meeting of a transition committee to begin work on the transfer will be in early October, LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said. 
Lawmakers and university officials hope the transfer will have a positive impact on enrollment. Despite national trends of falling enrollment, every school in the LSU System has reported increasing, often record-breaking enrollment over the past several years.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball issued subpoenas to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services on Friday seeking information regarding an unfunded law that was passed to help kinship care families in 2024. 
This came four days after Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate dismissed Ball’s lawsuit that sought to make the cabinet implement Senate Bill 151 and cooperate with a related investigation. The law has been in limbo due to a $20 million funding dispute between the legislative and executive branches of government.
Judge dismisses suit seeking to unlock aid for Kentucky kinship care families. Now what?  

Wingate made the decision to dismiss Ball’s suit, in part, because he said the auditor had not yet exhausted her options to obtain information from the cabinet about why the state failed to implement the law. 
In his ruling, he said, “no subpoenas have been sought, (the Cabinet for Health and Family Services) has complied with many of the auditor’s requests and, finally, CHFS has asserted that the auditor ‘need only provide a name and CHFS will set up an interview just as it always has.’” 
On Friday, the auditor’s office issued subpoenas seeking:

All internal Cabinet for Health and Family Services communications and external communications to, from, among, or between the cabinet and Gov. Andy Beshear’s office, the Office of State Budget Director, the General Assembly, the Legislative Research Commission, the federal government, and “any other person or entity” about Senate Bill 151 and “its execution or the decision not to execute” it. 
All information, including but not limited to documentation and communications, about the Department for Community Based Services’ (DCBS) working budget showing actual expenditures and when, how much, for what purpose, and why any unrestricted funds became obligated in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.
A list of all DCBS programs not codified in state statute or delineated within 2024 House Bill 6 (the budget). 
And more.

In a statement Ball said “I continue fighting for Kinship caregivers and the children in their care” by issuing the subpoenas and “we look forward to their production of all documents and witnesses.”

Cooper, a Democrat who is now running for U.S. Senate, oversaw the passage of Medicaid expansion while serving as governor. He frequently touts it as one of the highlights of his eight-year administration.
“It doesn’t have anything to do with waste, fraud and abuse,” Cooper said, pushing back on Republicans’ arguments that the bill will cut trim costs and bureaucracy. “They were creating this … so they could give people tax breaks.”
His criticism of the GOP-led “big, beautiful bill” came during a roundtable focused on health care costs and Medicaid — one of his first public appearances since formally launching his bid for Senate. And Cooper criticized his Republican opponent Michael Whatley’s support of the package.

The position has been vacant since May when Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure.
The state’s governing body which oversees Mississippi’s eight public universities voted Thursday during executive session at its annual retreat to select Association of Governing Board of Universities and Colleges Search, an executive headhunting firm based in Washington, D.C, to assist with naming the historically Black university’s next leader. 
The move is a departure from the IHL board’s usual pick, Academic Search, an executive firm they’ve used twice for past university president searches. 
In 2023, the board hired Academic Search for $115,000 after Thomas Hudson, Thompson’s predecessor, resigned. The board also paid the firm $85,000 for the Delta State search, which resulted in Dan Ennis. 
The firm presented a proposal that “best matched the qualifications outlined in the formal request for proposals,” a press statement from the board said. Trustees said it will iron out a formal contract with the firm in the next few days. 
In August, the board announced to the public it began its official search process three months after Thompson’s resignation. For months, alumni and supporters of the university have raised questions and called for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university.

Mikie Sherrill has for months urged her GOP rival, Jack Ciattarelli, to release his tax returns, as she has. Friday, he did.","Jack Ciattarelli speaks at a town hall in Pitman on Sept. 16, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor) Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who’s running to become New Jersey’s next governor, gave the press a peek at 13 years of his federal tax returns Friday after escalating calls for financial disclosure from his Democratic opponent in the race, Rep. Mikie Sherrill.
The returns show that Ciattarelli, 63, a former state assemblyman who started and sold two medical publishing businesses, has made almost $14.9 million in income and paid almost $4 million in federal, state and local taxes since 2012.
His most profitable year came in 2017, when he retired and sold his second medical publishing business. That year, he reported almost $7.1 million in total income, the returns show. Otherwise, his total reported annual income fluctuated between $600,946 (in 2014) and more than $1.3 million (in 2016) before he retired, and $168,433 (in 2022) and $854,966 (in 2018) after he retired, the returns show.
The returns were joint returns, filed with his ex-wife Melinda. The couple’s divorce was finalized this year. She reported little income most years, with $22,138 of total income reported in 2024, the returns show.
Ciattarelli paid an average effective tax rate of 28% per year when he was working full-time, with a high of 38% in 2016, his campaign spokespeople said.
The campaign gave reporters two hours to view but not copy a towering stack of returns at Ciattarelli’s accountant’s office in Clinton. In an accompanying press release, Ciattarelli called the disclosure “an unprecedented level of transparency for any gubernatorial candidate ever.”
“Now, it’s Mikie Sherrill’s turn,” he said in a statement, urging her to release her returns back to 2018 when she was first elected to Congress.
Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, found the timing of the disclosures noteworthy — two days before the first gubernatorial debate of the general election, with Ciattarelli and Sherrill scheduled to square off at 7 p.m. Sunday at Rider in Lawrenceville.
“It’s definitely something that I would have liked to have seen earlier in the campaign, because we have a limited amount of time to weigh this stuff out, but we got it on the eve of the first debate,” he said. “It’s pretty obvious that the goal here is to not fall under the criticism on Sunday night that he hadn’t disclosed his taxes.”
But he applauded Ciattarelli for disclosing returns back to 2012, his first full year in the New Jersey Legislature. He served in the Assembly from December 2011 until January 2018, making an annual salary in that post of $49,000.
“I think that’s a good standard, is to say: ‘You saw my finances while I was in office,’” Rasmussen said.
Ciattarelli did not release his returns when he ran for governor in 2021. Then, he ran against incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy and came close to unseating him. He also ran for the post in 2017 but lost to then-Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno in the Republican primary.
Financial disclosures are important so voters can learn the sources of candidates’ income and any conflicts of interest and go to the ballot box armed with more information about the candidates, Rasmussen said.
The details of Ciattarelli’s finances could deflate his criticism of Sherrill as a wealthy politician who cashed in on her time in Congress, Rasmussen said.
“I think it sort of levels the playing field from the public perception,” Rasmussen said. “You can’t really say that Mikie’s the millionaire here, because they both are candidates who have significant assets and significant income and significant means. I’m not going to compare income brackets, but it puts them more or less at parity. They both are candidates with significant incomes.”
Sherrill and her husband, a broker at UBS Securities, reported roughly $3.2 million in income for 2024, their tax returns say. They were billed $1.08 million in federal income tax; $279,010 in New York state income tax (UBS Securities is based in New York City); and $29,002 in New Jersey state income tax in 2024.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents paused review of a proposal from Kansas State University to offer a 90 credit hour bachelor’s degree in uncrewed aircraft systems that necessitated waiver of state policy mandating 120 hours of course credit to earn an undergraduate degree.
The hesitancy resulted from questions about how approval of K-State’s plan could alter the academic landscape of the state’s system of 32 public universities, community colleges and technical colleges. On Thursday, members of the Board of Regents raised issues with how potential students and higher education institutions, as well as business and industry, might respond if Kansas amended the foundational premise of a four-year degree.
The Board of Regents agreed to convene a task force to consider development of a systemwide policy before taking up proposals to sidestep existing rules requiring a bachelor’s degree to represent at least 120 credit hours of study.
“We don’t want to stymie the process,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents. “This needs a whole lot of thought and input.”
Jesse Perez Mendez, provost at K-State, said the university welcomed the opportunity to participate in the task force’s debate. He said the drone bachelor’s degree for K-State’s aviation campus in Salina had been under consideration along with reduced-credit degrees related to artificial intelligence.
“This is a little bit of a game changer overall and we need to be very cautious,” Mendez said. “What this conversation is not about? It’s not about taking a bachelor’s degree in psychology and reduce that down to three years. It’s with degrees we don’t have on the books.”
He said K-State was committed to collaborating with two-year community colleges and technical colleges on alternative degree offerings.
Board of Regents policy, but not state law, established a bachelor’s degree consist of at least 120 credit hours. Policy says 45 credits must be in upper-division courses. Kansas higher education has been under pressure to recruit students as the U.S. college-age population fell. At the same time, the cost of delivering college instruction kept escalating with inflation.
Heather Morgan, executive director of the Kansas Community College Association, said the 19 community colleges in Kansas had taken a keen interest in reform of laws or policies related to reduced-credit degrees.
She said issues to consider included retention of policy permitting community college students to transfer credits in core subject classes to a university. Supplemental degree models should respond to industry demands and tap into combined potential of the state’s higher education institutions, she said.
“One of the things we’ve been talking about is how do we use the assets we already have more efficiently and deploy expertise from a faculty perspective across all our colleges,” Morgan said.
 
Unanswered questions
Rusty Monhollon, vice president for academic affairs with the state Board of Regents, said the system had sought for the past decade to increase on-time graduation rates by reducing baccalaureate programs to 120 credit hours. The percentage of undergraduate programs in the Board of Regents system with more than 120 required credit hours decreased from 67% to 8%.
Nationally, he said, the movement to accredit reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees was deepening. In September 2024, the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits Kansas colleges and universities, released guidelines reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees.
Since March, nine U.S. colleges received HLC accreditation of alternative degrees. The list included business administration, information technology, pre-physical therapy, pre-athletic training, fashion business management, semiconductor materials and devices and applied cybersecurity.
“Proponents of these degrees claim they are affordable and match up well with workplace skills demand,” Monhollon said. “Others dismiss them, arguing industry does not recognize them and that they lack the scope and the depth of traditional bachelor’s degrees.”
He offered a range of questions that might be weighed: Would three-year degrees be valued by students, industry and in academic circles? Could reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees cheapen the value of a four-year degree? What would be cut — basic subjects or advanced classes — to shrink course requirements? What should a reduced-credit degree be called? Could Kansas run a pilot program to test supply and demand? What was the range for reduced-credit programs — 90 to 105 credit hours? How would it impact the system’s general education agreements? How should graduate school process applications from students with three-year degrees?
“Not all segments could fit into the three-year degree,” said Neelima Parasker, a member of the Board of Regents. “We have to go to industry and ask them for their feedback instead of just floating this and seeing what they do.”
 
‘Huge mistake’
Blake Benson, chairman of the Board of Regents, said he was curious if estimates could be made for how many new students would enroll in the state’s public education system if reduced-credit bachelor’s degrees were an option.
Board of Regents member Diana Mendoza said the term used to describe a reduced-credit degree was consequential. She asked if it could be referred to as a workforce specialist degree to help potential employers differentiate between three- and four-year diplomas.
Kathy Wolfe Moore, another member of the state board, said she was concerned Kansas’ higher education system could become “a bit of a slave to the employment fluctuations” in the business cycle.
“I’m quite sure this board … would have no interest in moving our system backward,” said Blake Flanders, who serves as CEO and president of the Board of Regents.
Flanders said expansion of reduced-credit degree programs in Kansas would be complex, but possible if crafted with attention to detail. The cost of eroding confidence in the value of a Kansas bachelor’s degree could be significant, he said.
“If we’re thinking  about, ‘Well, let’s just skinny down or gut that systemwide general education and get all of our savings out of those credits,’ I think, obviously, this board would believe that would be a huge mistake,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Kansas-Board-of-Regents-group-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 15:58:33.510381

A set of orders issued Friday moved the case forward to the high court, which will take up an appeal from the Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi. That case also includes several clean water and environmental advocates as plaintiffs. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The court will also hear a separate appeal from Flow Water Advocates, regarding the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to grant a permit for the Line 5 tunnel.
Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline has long been a point of concern for Indigenous tribes and environmentalists in the Great Lakes region, namely due to the 4.5 mile segment split into a dual set of pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet.
With Line 5 transporting 22 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the straits daily, pipeline opponents have called the 72-year-old pipeline a ticking time bomb, warning of catastrophic results should the pipelines rupture.
Enbridge identified gaps in the pipeline’s coating in 2014. The dual pipelines have also been hit by two anchor strikes since 2018 denting the pipeline in three places, damaging a support and prompting further concerns about the safety of Line 5.
The state and Enbridge later agreed that the company would replace the dual pipelines with a new segment located inside a concrete lined tunnel buried beneath the lakebed. However Line 5’s opponents have continued to call for the pipeline to be shut down, arguing the tunnel’s design carries risk for explosion, while the construction of the tunnel itself carries its own risks for environmental harm.
To move forward, Enbridge must receive permits from three agencies: the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
The Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates energy providers and energy infrastructure, approved permitting for the tunnel project in 2023. However, that decision was quickly challenged by the coalition of tribes and environmentalists.
Pipeline opponents have argued the Public Service Commission failed to make determinations required by the Michigan Environmental Protection Act, had improperly excluded evidence while considering the permit and failed to consider alternatives to the pipeline outside of the Straits of Mackinac. But the Michigan Court of Appeals ultimately upheld the regulatory body’s decision.
Carrie La Seur, the legal director for Flow Water advocates, celebrated the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the appeal.
“This is an incredibly important step forward for the protection of the Great Lakes,” La Seur said in a statement. “The public trust doctrine is a fundamental principle of Michigan law that must be considered in decisions that affect our natural resources. We are eager to argue this case and ensure that our state’s waters are protected for generations to come.”
Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle argued that, tunnel or no tunnel, Line 5 still poses a threat to the waters of the Great Lakes and the culture of tribal nations. 
“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” Gravelle said in a statement. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. We simply want government officials to consider the safest, cheapest, and most common-sense alternative: Decommission Line 5.”
Matt Helms, the spokesperson for the Michigan Public Service Commission said the body would not comment on the pending legislation. 
Enbridge did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication. 
While Enbridge received permits from EGLE in 2021, the company is awaiting a decision from the department following a required redo of its water resources permit. The tunnel project is also awaiting permitting from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with President Donald Trump’s Administration working to fast track approval.

Corcoran has led Ohio’s largest agency since the start of the DeWine administration in 2019. One major project under her leadership was the method in which the department paid for prescription drugs.
After being charged huge markups by massive drug middlemen, the department replaced them with a different arrangement that provided greater transparency and increased pharmacy reimbursements. Despite the increase, the new system saved $140 million over two years, the department’s actuarial firm reported.
“I wish Director Corcoran the very best in this next chapter,” DeWine said in a written statement. “Maureen has served the people of Ohio well throughout her career in public service, and I am grateful to her dedication and commitment to her fellow Ohioans.”
DeWine said the announcement of Corcoran’s successor is forthcoming.

(Photo by Kelly Winter for Utah News Dispatch)Almost all public universities advanced in the Utah Legislature’s mandated process to cut “inefficient” programs in order to direct their funding into high-demand course offerings that may lead to higher paying jobs. 
But Utah State University, which is undergoing a leadership transition and included in its original plans its intent to expand its nursing program, didn’t make the cut. 
Hooper Republican House Speaker Mike Schultz said during an interim executive appropriations meeting on Monday he had concerns about the reinvestment plans the school has presented so far as required by a 2025 law that ordered universities to cut 10% of their budget for courses and then allocate the funds to expand programs that may have waitlists.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This is the last step the universities had to go through before implementing their reinvestment plans. But USU’s plans have been deferred until a new university president presents a revised plan.
Budget bills targeting ‘underperforming’ university programs press forward

“I have a hard time understanding why we would be expanding into nursing into Utah State University. You have Weber State up there that has a fantastic program already in northern Utah,” Schultz said. “To me, it just seems duplicative and kind of goes against what we’re trying to accomplish.
According to a Utah System of Higher Education presentation, health care is the No. 1 category the public universities system as a whole has identified for its reinvestment funds. So far, plans are to allocate 32.6% of the joint reinvestment account for that area. 
Nursing was one of the study areas a legislative audit — which helped inform the new law — specifically identified as in high demand. 
But that need isn’t a fact that Schultz contested during the Monday meeting. For him, the issue was that other institutions could pick up that expansion. That, in addition to the amount of new schools and administrative roles that Utah State University proposed. 
Within the reinvestment process, Utah State University has to cut and reallocate at least $12.5 million from its current budget. In the current plan, the largest chunk of the money will go to what the school describes as “technologies and careers of the future,” which includes a new school of computing, a new chemical engineering program, an AI center and an aviation expansion.



Let us know what you think...


 


A big portion of the funds is also going to health and well-being workforce, including $1.2 million allocated to expand mental health programs, $1 million for a nursing expansion, $775,000 for a new college of health and human sciences, and $385,300 for a new doctor of physical therapy. 
With Utah State University being the state’s sole land-grant institution, Schultz said, it is “uniquely set up to be doing natural resources, and working hard on natural resources; energy, critical minerals. These are things that are so important to our economy right now, and Utah’s leading out on so many of these things already.”
Schultz was also disappointed to not see more about agriculture innovation research in the plans, he said.
Alan Smith, interim president of USU, said the university is still investing in areas like energy engineering, chemical engineering and other mining programs. Some of that investment is part of this specific initiative, but funding for them also comes from other ongoing state investment.
Last year when the university doubled its space for pre-nursing majors to 120 spots a year, they were filled immediately, Smith said.
“We’d like to expand on that, because there’s a clear, strong interest and a strong need throughout the state, and I think there’s room for multiple institutions to have strength there,” Smith said. “We welcome Weber being in that arena, the U. being in that arena, and others, because there’s a true shortage.”
Despite those concerns, the decision to defer the approval of USU’s reinvestment plans was expected, said Amanda DeRito, the university’s associate vice president for strategic communications.
At each step of the process with the Utah Board of Higher Education and other legislative panels, “approval of Utah State University’s plan was conditional on approval from our next president,” she said in a statement.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)The developers of the Revolution Wind project and two attorneys general whose states were set to buy its electricity both filed lawsuits contending the same thing on the same day — that the Trump administration violated its constitutional powers in halting construction on the project — but in different venues. 
On Sept. 4, the developers took their case challenging the Aug. 22 stop work order to Washington D.C. Hours later, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong appealed to the Rhode Island federal courts to revive work on the 65-turbine project.
How many lawsuits does it take to restart Revolution Wind? More than one.

Ahead of a Monday hearing in D.C. on the developers’ lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking to transfer the AGs case from Rhode Island to D.C., and consolidate the two complaints into one.
A 14-page motion filed on Wednesday in federal court in Rhode Island points to the similarities between the two lawsuits, as well as the D.C. court’s existing knowledge of the project, which has already been subject of legal complaints by the Preservation Society of Newport County and Green Oceans, a citizen-led anti-wind group based in Little Compton.
“Given the significant overlap between Revolution Wind and the States’ claims and requested relief, as well as [District of D.C.]’s existing familiarity with the Project and the issues raised in the States’ complaint, this Court should transfer this case to [the District of DC,]” Justice Department lawyers wrote. “Federal Defendants thus expeditiously move to transfer this case to D.D.C. to ensure the two cases can be litigated efficiently and to avoid inconsistent judgments on the same set of facts and issues.”
Megan Skinner, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an email Friday the AGs will submit a written response to the court by Oct. 1.
However, in the initial complaint filed in Rhode Island, Neronha and Tong justified the decision to file in Rhode Island, rather than D.C. because of the Ocean State’s proximity to the project. Revolution Wind sits 15 nautical miles south of Rhode Island, with the bulk of the port activity transferring workers and equipment to and from the project taking place in Rhode Island and Connecticut. More than 1,000 union laborers across both states now stand to lose the jobs they already lined up if the project does not resume. The abrupt halt to the project has also put both states’ climate change mandates in jeopardy and could cost regional ratepayers more than $500 million a year without the 704 megawatts of renewable energy the project is set to produce at its maximum.
“A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred and continues to occur within Rhode Island,” the AGs wrote. “Rhode Island is the “State nearest the place the cause of action arose.”
While the project developers have also described environmental and labor consequences in their own lawsuit, their case features much more information about the financial losses the companies will incur on their $5 billion investment — $2 million in losses a day on work and equipment contracts for every day of the pause, along with an estimated $1 billion in “breakaway costs” if the project is canceled.
Chris Raia, a spokesperson for Ørsted, the co-developer of the project, declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation.
U.S. District Judge Mary S. McElroy, who is presiding over the AGs case in Rhode Island, has not indicated when she will rule on the Justice Department’s request to transfer the case, according to the public court docket. The clerk’s office did not immediately respond to questions Friday.

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent)Boeing union workers on strike in the St. Louis area voted Friday to approve a union-proposed contract, after overwhelmingly rejecting Boeing’s settlement offer last week.
The four-year contract, proposed by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837, includes a $10,000 ratification bonus  compared to the $4,000 bonus Boeing proposed. It also addresses one of the workers’ biggest concerns – pay raises for top-of-scale members and 401(k) benefits. 
“Our members stood up with courage and voted for a fair, responsible pathway to end this strike,” said IAM Union International President Brian Bryant in a statement Friday. “Now, Boeing must honor that decision, accept this deal, and show respect for the skilled workers who are the backbone of its defense business.”
The union’s proposed ratification bonus is lower than what the $12,000 Boeing employees in Seattle received last year after a seven-week strike, said Jonathan Battaglia, spokesman for the IAM Union. However, the 401(k) benefits are the same as those Seattle workers received, he said. 
About 3,200 Boeing workers who assemble advanced aircraft and weapons systems at the company’s facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill. have been on strike since Aug. 4.
Earlier this week, Boeing officials called the vote on the union contract a “publicity stunt” and told workers it was a “waste of your time.” 
Dan Gillian, Boeing St. Louis vice president of air dominance, said in a statement Friday that the company’s last offer would make workers the “highest paid manufacturing employees in the St. Louis area.”
“We want all 3,200 of you back at work as soon as possible,” Gillian said. “But that has to happen with a contract that makes sense in the Midwest, not the Pacific Northwest. Our previous offer is far more lucrative than other recently ratified contracts for complex manufacturing work in our region.”
He pointed to GE Aerospace and the IAM union in Cincinnati that ratified a five-year contract with general wage increases of 19.5% over five years. Boeing’s last offer was 24% over five years.  
Gillian said this week that Boeing is open to further discussions, but the “overall economics of our offer will not improve.”
Missouri Democratic Congressmen Wesley Bell of St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, along with members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, urged Boeing this week to return to the bargaining table. 
“These workers—among the most talented in their fields—deliver quality products that serve the entire nation, and the world,” said Bell and Cleaver in a letter to Boeing president and CEO Kelly Ortberg. “If an agreement is not reached soon, the loss of income, healthcare, and other essential resources could cause hardships not seen since 1997.” 
Last week, the union workers voted to reject Boeing’s settlement second offer that the company touts as offering 45% average wage growth. The workers said that it wasn’t much different than the company’s first offer in August that caused the strike.
Chad Stevenson, a plant chairman for the union at the St. Louis facility, told The Independent in August that the company’s offer wouldn’t equally benefit the longtime workers who endured pay freezes when the company’s contracts were “lean” over the last several years.
“Our members took concessions to help this company and continued to produce the same amount and the same quality of work,” said Stevenson, who works as an assembly mechanic. “So really it was over eight years, top-scale wasn’t raised.”
The union’s proposed contract includes an hourly increase for two of the four years, instead of “lump sum” amounts that Boeing proposed. Battaglia said employees prefer the $1.50 hourly increase because it “builds on each other,” unlike the lump sum.
“Our members have spoken loudly — we are ready to return to work once Boeing accepts this agreement,” said IAM District 837 Directing Business Representative Tom Boelling in a union statement Friday. “It’s up to the company to get our members back to what they do best: building world-class aircraft for our nation’s defense.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2976-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 14:58:41.545302

Tahesha Way requires landlords inform their tenants of lead risks and failed lead tests.,"From left, a lead pipe, a corroded steel pipe, and a lead pipe treated with protective orthophosphate. Lead pipes cause health problems and drive up water bills. (Photo courtesy Environmental Protection Agency)Landlords will be required to report the presence of lead water lines to their tenants under a bill Acting Gov. Tahesha Way signed into law Friday.
The new law requires landlords to disclose to current and prospective tenants whether water utilities have said their rental unit is serviced by lines that may contain lead and whether the unit is old enough to contain lead piping. It also requires landlords to provide to tenants copies of notices within the last three years that found lead levels exceeded acceptable levels in the unit’s service area.
“With this bill, we’re protecting New Jerseyans in their communities,” said Way. “No child or adult should ever be forced to live with the detrimental and lasting health effects caused by lead poisoning from their homes.”
Way, who is lieutenant governor and secretary of state, is acting governor while Gov. Phil Murphy is abroad on a trade mission to India.
Lead exposure can cause serious health risks, particularly in children, who risk developmental delays, behavioral changes, and other physical and neurological symptoms when exposed to the metal, typically over months or years.
The new law also allows residents to request their utility test their water for lead. If lead levels are within acceptable bounds, utilities must only conduct that test once a year at a given property. If lead levels are too high, the utility must retest every 60 days until lead levels are acceptable in two consecutive tests.
“Lead contamination is prevalent in all regions across the state, and it is crucial that we protect the health of our New Jersey families,” said Assemblyman Gary Schaer (D-Passaic), the bill’s chief Assembly sponsor. “Some of the oldest residential structures in New Jersey are in our urban communities, like Passaic, which are disproportionately impacted by lead contamination in water service lines.”
The new law, which sailed through both legislative chambers in unanimous votes, gives the Departments of Health, Community Affairs, and Environmental Protection six months to develop a notice informing residents about the risks of lead exposure and waterborne lead, including information on protective measures.
Landlords must begin informing their residents of properties’ lead risks in the 90 days after the departments draft that notice. They would not be required to issue similar notices for lease renewals after the initial wave.
Real estate agents are not responsible for providing those notices unless they are also the property’s landlord.
Lead water lines have been federally banned since 1986, though many aging homes around New Jersey still contain them.
A lead line replacement program launched in Newark in 2019, three years after tests found elevated lead levels in Newark schools, replaced roughly 23,000 lead pipes.

The senators' letter criticizes Carr for his comments about taking action against ABC Television in response to Jimmy Kimmel's comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk.  (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Democratic senators including Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) have written to the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to criticize the agency’s chairman’s attacks on late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.
ABC television, part of Disney, suspended Kimmel’s show indefinitely Wednesday after criticism of the comedian’s remarks that FCC Chair Brendan Carr made on a right-wing podcast.
On his program, “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Monday and Tuesday, Kimmel made several comments about last week’s shooting of Charlie Kirk, including the statement that “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
The Associated Press reported the suspension was announced after a group of ABC affiliates said they would not air Kimmel’s program and after Carr suggested on the Benny Johnson podcast Wednesday that the FCC was considering taking action against the network.
In a letter Thursday, 11 Democratic senators, including Baldwin, told Carr, “You proceeded to threaten that the FCC ‘can do this the easy way or the hard way,’ and telegraphed that ‘there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead’ unless ABC affiliates ‘find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel . . .’”
“It is not simply unacceptable for the FCC Chairman to threaten a media organization because he does not like the content of its programming — it violates the First Amendment that you claim to champion,” the senators wrote.
“The FCC’s role in overseeing the public airwaves does not give it the power to act as a roving press censor, targeting broadcasters based on their political commentary,” they added. “But under your leadership, the FCC is being weaponized to do precisely that.”
The letter calls Carr’s statements “a betrayal of the FCC’s mission,” suggesting that he was trying to police speech and “force broadcasters to adopt political viewpoints that you favor,” and “requiring them to act in ‘Trump’s interest’” rather than in the public interest, as called for in the Federal Communications Act.
The letter notes that Nextar — which operates 23 ABC affiliates according to the AP and has a merger pending before the FCC — announced it would take Kimmel’s show off the air. Disney then announced it was suspending Kimmel’s show indefinitely.
“This is precisely what government censorship looks like,” the senators wrote.
Carr’s comments were an about-face from a 2022 post on X, when he defended late-night comedians and political satirists and “rightly rejected government censorship as a threat to our First Amendment protections,” the senators wrote. “But as FCC Chairman, you now have apparently forgotten these principles.”
The letter demands that by Sept. 25, Carr answer three questions in writing: about the FCC’s public interest standard and its definitions of political bias; whether the agency has communicated with Disney, ABC or their affiliates about Kimmel and his show; and what he meant by “the hard way” and “the easy way” in his podcast remarks.
The letter was led by Sen. Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts). In addition to Baldwin it was signed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington), Ben Ray Lujan (D-New Mexico), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Delaware), John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), Gary Peters (D-Michigan), Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota).

In an interview published Thursday, Fargo radio station The Flag (WZFG) asked North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley if he would file a lawsuit against South Dakota. Wrigley said his office is “examining all possibilities.” He also criticized South Dakota’s law, calling it a “bad policy choice” and a “hostile act.”
“To have a nation, you have to have commerce between, around and across states,” Wrigley said. “There are limitations on what one state can do that then would make them the regulator of the nation, so to speak.”

The South Dakota legislation, signed into law in March, prohibits the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects. Eminent domain is the legal right to access private property for projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. It’s commonly used for projects such as electrical power lines, water pipelines, oil pipelines and highways.
The change effectively blocked Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions from constructing its proposed $9 billion pipeline across South Dakota to connect ethanol plants in that state, as well as Minnesota, Iowa and Nebraska, with plants and an underground storage site in North Dakota. The project would capitalize on federal tax credits incentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.
Summit has since sought to remove language from its Iowa permit conditioning the start of construction on approvals in the Dakotas. The project has permits not only in Iowa but also in North Dakota and Minnesota, while Nebraska has no permitting process for the project and South Dakota regulators have twice rejected Summit’s applications. Summit did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
South Dakota’s Speaker of the House, Rep. Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, criticized Wrigley’s comments. Hansen, one of several candidates for governor next year, was one of the sponsors of the eminent domain ban and voted for it. He is campaigning with his running mate, Rep. Karla Lems, R-Canton, the bill’s prime sponsor in the House.
“Let’s call this what it is,” Hansen wrote on social media. “It appears the carbon pipeline lobbyists have found their latest puppet — and now North Dakota taxpayers might be forced to bankroll a lawsuit against their own neighbors in South Dakota, all to help a private carbon pipeline company.” 
Pipeline opponents call for Iowa regulators to reject Summit’s proposed permit changes

Sen. Mark Lapka, R-Leola, the bill’s prime sponsor in the South Dakota Senate, defended the legislation. He said the bill “in no way, shape or form” prevents a carbon pipeline from being built in South Dakota but instead gives landowners an option.
“They now have the ability to choose whether they want to participate in something, or — if it does not work out for their best interests — they have the opportunity to say no,” Lapka said.
Republican South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office would be responsible for defending the state if a lawsuit is filed.
“I will defend the laws and people of South Dakota, it’s as simple as that,” Jackley said in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight. “The Legislature voted for the private property rights by wide margins, and Gov. Rhoden signed it into law. The people of South Dakota voted decisively on this issue, and I will support them.”
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office referred Searchlight to a letter he sent legislators in March explaining his decision to sign the bill. The letter referenced “easements,” which are land access agreements, and made a distinction between voluntary easements and the involuntary kind that could come with eminent domain. 
“South Dakota landowners feel strongly that the threat of involuntary easements for the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline infringes on their freedoms and their property rights,” Rhoden wrote in the letter.

Local businesses, UW’s student paper, a Teton County daily among those in the fray.
The post Charlie Kirk killing fuels free speech disputes in Wyoming as newspapers come under attack appeared first on WyoFile .","Two days after an assassin shot and killed Charlie Kirk, the student newspaper at the University of Wyoming published two stories about the conservative activist who’d visited Laramie’s campus only a few months before. 
One was a reported news story, the other an opinion column. Both were written by Charles Vaughters, editor-in-chief of The Branding Iron. As is happening in communities across the U.S. in the days since Kirk’s killing, they would provoke outrage and debate over freedom of speech amid growing concerns about political violence. And that rancor, at least in Wyoming, wouldn’t stop with the Brandon Iron.
In the editorial, Vaughters described his experience attending Kirk’s April UW visit. 
“During the entirety of the event, Kirk repeatedly stressed that he only wanted what was best for America, and I believed him,” Vaughters wrote.
The student journalist, who voted for Trump, said he and Kirk “may have had some disagreements on certain policy issues,” but he thought “the man was genuine in his belief that he was doing what was right for the country.” 
The same day Vaughters sat down to pen his editorial, he wrote, the paper asked students on campus what they thought of Kirk’s death. “Most were sympathetic, and you can read their quotes in this very paper,” Vaughters wrote. 
One student, however, was particularly baffling to the paper, Vaughters wrote. The student, “who repeatedly refused to identify themself, basically said that this was a good thing. That Charlie Kirk deserved to die for harboring fascist and racist beliefs.”
“We found that absolutely disgusting,” Vaughters wrote, adding that the paper does “not condone any acts of political violence” and prides itself “on including opinion pieces from writers on every side of the political aisle, should they want to get their voices out there.” 
Vaughters concluded by asking readers to pray for Kirk.
A few hours after the paper was printed and distributed across campus, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus took to social media. The group represents the further right flank of the Republican Party, and its lawmakers control the Wyoming House of Representatives. 
“Why is the UW student newspaper platforming students who support political assassinations? This level of indifference toward human life is dangerous and unacceptable,” the caucus posted on both Facebook and X.

The Facebook post, in particular, erupted into a sprawling, and at times strained, virtual debate. More than 500 comments piled on, many weighing in on the bounds of free speech. Some pointed to the perceived political leanings of the University of Wyoming, saying they would no longer support the school. Several commenters echoed the caucus’ criticism of the paper. 
Others focused on the unnamed student. Some called on the student to be identified, to be expelled, to be watched, to have their gun rights stripped. Others said the student should be free to voice their opinion. 
Quote sparks more controversy
The next day, another virtual cycle began.
After the Cowboy State Daily, the state’s largest news organization, published a story about the student paper and campus reactions to Kirk’s killing, the Freedom Caucus singled out a graduate student quoted in that story, posting her photograph on its social media feeds. 
“Charlie Kirk, in his heart, thought he was doing the right thing, but I think he also spread a lot of horrible rhetoric,” Cowboy State Daily quoted the grad student saying. “I’m not happy to see him murdered in front of his family at all, but I’m also aware that I think I was happy to have his voice out of the spotlight.” 
(Both the graduate student and the editor-in-chief declined WyoFile’s request for interviews.) 
Again, hundreds of comments poured in, split on freedom of speech and what, if any, repercussions the student should face. Some were outraged at the student, and questioned why the public would pay for the salary of someone with her opinions. But for others, even staunch Republicans, the matter came down to the need to protect speech, regardless of whether they found it callous. 
“I’m really struggling to understand why the Freedom Caucus wants to vilify speech. I mean really struggling!” one commenter wrote. “I am a staunch conservative. A constitutionalist to the core. The Republican party is typically too centrist for me, but this is insane! I mourn CK as well. But this is not the answer. It’s like we are doxing people for the rhetoric we don’t agree with in an effort to effectively ‘cancel’ them. Sound like any other party we know?!”
As a conservative activist, Kirk rose to prominence in part for taking on the country’s higher education system for what he saw as policing conservative speech and producing an out-of-control cancel culture. He was perhaps best known for visiting college campuses and inviting students and staff to publicly question and debate him. He also launched an online watchlist in 2016 that targeted university professors who were believed to “discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” 
UW and the Freedom Caucus
The Facebook posts focusing on The Branding Iron and the grad student weren’t the first time the Wyoming Freedom Caucus has been critical of the  University of Wyoming. In fact, the group has a lengthy history challenging the state’s lone four-year public university.
In late 2022, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus caucus criticized the university for revoking a church leader’s tabling privileges after he targeted a transgender student by name in a sign in the Wyoming Union breezeway. 
“It is clear that the University of Wyoming has impermissibly silenced the protected speech of a Wyoming citizen,” the caucus said in a statement at the time. “The Wyoming Freedom Caucus will not allow Wyoming’s lone land-grant university to bow to the cancel mob. The recent actions of the University of Wyoming are out of step with the people of our State.”

The caucus also pointed ahead to the 2023 session in the statement as an opportunity for “our caucus together with other likeminded legislators to examine closely how the University of Wyoming is spending public dollars. The session will also allow for the legislature to pursue meaningful oversight of the University.”
Two years later, the Legislature voted to cut the school’s block grant and forbade it from spending that appropriation on its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. More recently, Freedom Caucus members have expressed interest in having more of a say in the school’s spending as part of its plans to “DOGE” the state budget.
Asked to what extent the Freedom Caucus remains concerned about freedom of speech on UW’s campus, the group’s chair, Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, told WyoFile in a statement, “the right of these troubled students to celebrate Charlie Kirk’s murder does not limit the right of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus to call them out for it.”
“Students are free to say what they want — and we are free to call out any state employee who supports political assassinations,” she wrote. “It is completely within the realm of the First Amendment to point out that Wyoming taxpayers are paying someone who celebrated the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Doing so is an aspect of freedom itself.”

Comments and firings
What’s happening in Laramie is a reflection of a larger trend. Across the country, many Republicans are carrying out a campaign to expose and punish those whose comments on Kirk are deemed inappropriate. 
Numerous professionals, from government employees to teachers and college professors, have reportedly lost their jobs for posting comments critical of Kirk, according to PBS NewsHour. 
“When you see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder, call them out. And hell, call their employer,” Vice President JD Vance said while hosting The Charlie Kirk Show podcast on Monday. “We don’t believe in political violence, but we believe in civility. There is no civility in the celebration of political assassination.” 
Firings have been reported in various professions. One of the more high-profile dismissals involved Disney’s decision this week to remove late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel from the air waves after he commented on Kirk’s accused assassin.
Cartoon provokes backlash
Closer to home, at least two local businesses in Lander have faced harassment for online comments posted by their owners. In Jackson, the local newspaper company temporarily closed its doors after a syndicated cartoon printed in its weekend edition of the Jackson Hole Daily sparked outrage. 
“Our front office door is locked,” read a sign earlier this week on the door of Teton Media Works, the umbrella company for both the Jackson Hole News&Guide and Jackson Hole Daily. 
“After receiving multiple threats of violence against our employees, we will be glad to assist you via phone or email.”
The publication removed the cartoon from its digital edition and one of its editors apologized to readers, explaining that they understood the cartoon “to suggest that Kirk’s assination might be a turning point in our nation’s divide,” and “as a statement that the United States is at a turning point as a nation, where political violence is escalating at an alarming rate.” 
The company’s owners also published a letter to readers Wednesday. 
“To move forward, we will use this fracture of trust to ensure everything we do reflects our publishing principles: Seek the truth and report it. Minimize harm. Act independently. Be accountable and transparent,” the letter reads. “We have changed internal content review, and we have re-engineered editing processes to uphold these values.”
Chip Bok, the right-leaning cartoonist who produced the cartoon, took a different tone following uproar in other states where his cartoon was published in local papers. 
“My agenda as a cartoonist is basically free speech. That made Charlie Kirk my kind of guy,” Bok wrote on his website. 
“Here’s my apology: I’m sorry Charlie Kirk isn’t around to give these guys a free speech lesson.” 
The Wyoming Democratic Party on Thursday warned of a crackdown on free speech.
“Free speech is a core American value — and one that Charlie Kirk himself championed,” the party said in a press release. “That’s why, even as we condemn the horrific shooting in the strongest possible terms, we cannot stand by while politicians in Washington and here in Wyoming use this tragedy to crack down on free speech.”
The party also accused the Freedom Caucus of turning “this tragedy into a McCarthy-style witch hunt” for its decision to target the student paper and a graduate student. 
“It will take all of us, across the political spectrum pushing back to protect our constitutional rights,” the party wrote. 
Some suggested a simple solution, and one often advocated by Kirk himself: more speech.
On Wide Right Turn, one of the state’s conservative podcasts, host Joey Correnti and Sheridan Republican Rep. Tom Kelly described their horror with “those celebrating and rationalizing the assassination” as well as their disappointment with “those on the right espousing a desire for revenge” in Tuesday’s episode. 
“Put the rage away,” Kelly said. “Do what Charlie would have wanted you to do, and keep talking.”

Ninety-five Democrats voted in favor of the resolution, 38 voted “present” and 22 did not vote. All 215 Republican votes were in support of the resolution. Four GOP members did not vote.Tensions emerged in Congress in the days since Kirk was fatally shot Sept. 10 while speaking on a Utah college campus. The resolution also came as President Donald Trump and his administration have sought to crack down on rhetoric surrounding Kirk’s death. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and members of the Cabinet plan to attend a memorial service for Kirk on Sunday in Arizona.“We passed a resolution to honor the life and legacy of Charlie Kirk, my late friend, the friend of so many in this chamber, and we called out political violence in America,” House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters in the U.S. Capitol following the vote.The Louisiana Republican recited the last line of the resolution, which says the House “calls upon all Americans ... to reject political violence, recommit to respectful debate, uphold American values, and respect one another as fellow Americans.” “Sadly, a number of Democrats could not bring themselves to vote for that,” Johnson said. “We have to let everybody make their own judgments about that.” In a Friday statement, Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke and members of the group said “violence has no place in our politics,” including the killing of Kirk. “At the same time, we must condemn violence without abandoning our right to speak out against ideas that are inconsistent with our values as Americans,” the New York Democrat and caucus members said, adding that they “strongly disagree with many of the beliefs Charlie Kirk promoted.” They also described the House resolution as “an attempt to legitimize Kirk’s worldview — a worldview that includes ideas many Americans find racist, harmful, and fundamentally un-American.”Friday’s passage came a day after the Senate passed a resolution — introduced by Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott — that designates Oct. 14, 2025, as a “National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk.” There was no roll call vote taken.Oct. 14 marks Kirk’s birthday. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-09-19 14:58:41.545302

Gavin Newsom signed today extends California clean-energy programs while taking steps to shore up oil and gas production. It also opens the door to a Western energy grid.,"In summary
A set of laws Gov. Gavin Newsom signed today extends California clean-energy programs while taking steps to shore up oil and gas production. It also opens the door to a Western energy grid.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a sweeping package of climate and energy policies to extend the cap-and-trade greenhouse gas emissions program, increase oil drilling and allow the state to create a Western regional electricity market. 
The overhaul that Newsom and top lawmakers negotiated in the final days of the legislative session amid heavy lobbying last week reflects urgency in the Democratic Party to preserve its climate goals while simultaneously reining in the surging gas and energy costs that have threatened to drive voters to the right. 
Lawmakers opened the session this year declaring a focus on making California more affordable, following a bruising national election for Democrats. The energy package was central to that goal, with progressives proposing to lower costs with industry regulations.
But after two years declaring special sessions targeting the oil and gas industry, Newsom began to warm up to them as oil refineries announced closures that could send gas prices spiking. As a result, one of the bills he signed Friday would boost domestic oil production in Kern County by approving a long-delayed environmental impact report for new wells. 
“We have to effectively transition,” Newsom said at an event in San Francisco. “This is not an ideological endeavor. We’re in the practical application business. We’ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals. So this lays it out. But it lays it out without laying tracks over folks.”
The biggest part of the complex package he signed were bills to extend the state’s cap and trade program, which since 2013 has put a price tag on carbon emissions. The program caps the amount of greenhouse gases that polluting industries can emit, and to a limited extent allows companies that cut emissions to sell permits to other companies that pollute. The program raises money for many of the state’s climate programs. 
The extension leaves the program largely the same, which disappointed environmental justice advocates who argued it has allowed oil and gas to continue polluting near low-income communities. In a nod to those concerns, Newsom also signed another bill in the package that creates a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.
He also signed two bills affecting the electricity grid. One would allow the state to create a Western regional energy market, allowing the state to trade more electricity with neighbors. 
Proponents, including mainstream environmental groups, say the idea would lower prices by allowing California producers to sell excess clean energy during times the state doesn’t need it — when it’s sunny, but not hot, for example, while importing power during heat waves and other high-demand times. 
The other bill aims to lower the cost of transmission infrastructure for customers by setting up a public financing system for building new power lines. It would also prevent some utilities’ wildfire mitigation costs from being passed on to customers, and replenish the state’s wildfire fund by $18 billion. The money, paid by shareholders and ratepayers over the next decade, is used to pay wildfire victims. 
The package Newsom signed leaves one imminent concern unaddressed: upcoming refinery closures. Negotiations late in the legislative session to keep two Bay Area refineries open have so far failed to produce any deals. 
Some Democrats simply didn’t want to give more to the oil industry, while others disagreed on how much support the state should provide, Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Suisun City Democrat, told CalMatters last week. Wilson had been pushing for the state to support the Valero refinery in Benicia that is now set to close by the end of the year without a deal, costing the city its largest private employer.

(Photo via Lone Peak Film Festival)A film festival geared toward showing “uplifting” movies and shorts is coming to Big Sky this weekend.
It’s the first year for the Lone Peak Film Festival in Big Sky, which will have six feature films and 16 shorts. The event will also include a mentorship program for local Native American filmmakers. 
Feature films include “Bring Them Home (Aiskótáhkapiyaaya),” “Lost Wolves of Yellowstone,” “Champions of the Golden Valley,” “Runa Simi,” “Sing Sing” and “Cutting Through the Rocks.”
The festival starts on Friday and runs through Sunday, with a mixture of free and paid events throughout the weekend.
“They’re all uplifting. So they all focus a light on the good in humanity. There’s no denying that there’s a lot of bad stuff going on,” said Daniel Glick, who helped found the festival. “But we also want to highlight that there are a lot of people who are trying to make the world a bit more sane and healthy too.”
The film festival is also in part sponsored by the state Department of Commerce, and Montana has long been a home for filmmakers. The state passed legislation earlier this year to extend a film tax credit and also sought to fix a problem, which was film tax credits getting sucked up by large productions, namely “Yellowstone.”
Senate Bill 326 brought by Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson sought to address the issue. It had a somewhat dramatic path before being signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte — the bill was killed and revived and drew significant floor discussion. It also was one of the final bills the legislature passed during the 2025 session.
“We need the big guys, but more importantly, we need the little guys too, to make sure that they grow and prosper,” Hertz said in a House Taxation committee meeting on April 15. “And it all works out for Montana. We also have additional incentives to hire veterans and Native Americans into the bill.”
SB 326 will provide $12 million per year to the film industry in Montana, and some of that money will go to Montana production companies and small filmmakers. The bill also extended the tax credit until 2045.
Movie productions are incredibly expensive, said Glick, who described a film he wants to shoot on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. The problem is, he said, without production credits, it’s hard to find investors, and he may be forced to shoot a film across the border in Canada.
“There’s a huge, huge appetite for people to make films here, like locals, every filmmaker in Montana that I know wants to make multiple films in Montana … all of them have stories set here in Montana. But without that kind of incentive, it’s just very hard to get the investment needed,” Glick said. “… Filmmaking is a high risk venture, and so you need people willing to take the risk. And those credits are a way to incentivize investors.”
Events like the Big Sky Film Festival in Missoula draw crowds, and the expectation is Lone Peak will too. Organizers of the Lone Peak event spent time in the Big Sky area, seeing if there was appetite in the community for the festival, Glick said.
“Pretty much all the way to everyone we talked to said, ‘Yeah, the community would love this.’” Glick said. “So we moved ahead. And it wasn’t until three months ago that we decided to actually pull the trigger and say, ‘We’re going to do it.’ So …it’s been a rocket ship since then.”
The festival will also include opportunities for those aspiring for careers in the filmmaking industry, including Chase Hall and Destini Vaile. They’ll get a chance to meet people and be mentees.
Hall is the son of a stuntman and said his dad has done stunts for major productions, including the “Magnificent 7” and “Yellowstone.” His interest came early.
“I was exposed to a decent amount of film sets,” Hall said on Thursday.
He said he was a little nervous about this weekend but excited for the mentorship. Hall is from Browning and graduated from Montana State University with a degree in film studies.
He said he likes to focus on the theme of identity, and a previous mentor observed the same in his work.
“They noticed my work kind of goes through exploring identity as a contemporary Native American, through the lens of surrealism,” Hall said.
Vaile recently finished her master’s of fine arts at the University of Montana. She’s created scripts for a couple of projects, including “Cereal,” which is about a 15-year old having a daily breakfast with her grandmother in the month before she died. 
“It’s a bit autobiographical, but, you know, somewhat fictionalized, to just draw out the core of the story … I was staying with her a lot, and we would just have breakfast in the morning and talk about things,” Vaile said. “So it’s kind of just trying to capture that moment.”
She also enjoyed the time she spent at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Sante Fe, New Mexico. There, she said, she had the ability to express a creative vision with the lens of her culture.
Her cohort at the University of Montana was all women, which she said was a good experience.
“It was just nice to experience that with just really capable, skilled women with, like, a vision,” Vaile said.

(Photo by Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)It’s been nearly three months since the constitutionally-mandated deadline for state lawmakers in Harrisburg to pass a budget. But partisan gridlock continues to hold up negotiations.
Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, while Democrats maintain a one-vote edge in the House. Both chambers must agree on a spending plan before Gov. Josh Shapiro can sign it.
Until then, money meant for counties’ safety net programs will be held up, potentially affecting local governments’ ability to provide services and programs aimed primarily at helping their communities’ most vulnerable residents. 
Pennsylvania is one of only two states that have been unable to pass some form of a budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year. The other is Michigan. In other states, lawmakers have reached deals on spending plans – or contingencies. North Carolina, for example, has passed a “mini-budget” bill that prevents disruptions in state operations. 
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

As the general assembly drags its feet, some funding that counties receive from the state for human service and safety net programs cannot go through. That’s led counties with smaller reserves to borrow funds, which they’ll have to pay interest on and may not be reimbursed for by the state, or cut services where allowed. 
Affected programs include senior services, drug and alcohol programs, child welfare services and health departments.
“It means the third-party providers are just going to get paid less until the budget is paid less and the counties are fully funded,” said Kyle Kopko, the executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. “That’s varied from county to county. And those third-party providers that rely on those funds, that’s going to affect their bottom line and payrolls too.”
Kopko said that counties across the state have also had to halt travel reimbursements for employees, cut overtime or borrow money, which will lead to interest payments .

“That obviously impacts counties’ ability to provide human services in a timely manner, or in as robust of a manner as is required by law,” Kopko said.
Public schools are feeling the squeeze too, which may get much worse if the impasse drags on any longer.
While many counties are able to maintain spending, having recently collected property taxes, Kopko said that, come next month, school districts are going to face “some real financial pressures.”
Already, he said, some have foregone new textbook purchases or are cutting programs out of school hours in case the stalemate drags on even longer.
“Depending on the county, this can be a third or more of the budget,” Kopko said about state funding. “They are required to provide a wide range of services that are mandated by law, and they don’t have the resources because the state hasn’t taken action. We’re still trying to wrap our heads around how much money is at play.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Divided legislature brings partisan politics into the mix
Both parties have been tight-lipped about what progress has and hasn’t been made, and what the largest obstacles to a compromise are.
But each side has made one thing clear: the partisan disagreements over how to approach the budget run deep.”
“House Democrats, even with a razor-thin majority, have demonstrated time and time again that we want to work together and compromise with Senate Republicans to pass legislation that moves Pennsylvania forward,” Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for House Democrats said. “Unfortunately during this budget cycle, Senate Republicans have not been willing to come to the table with the realization that any solution will take bipartisan support both in their chamber and the legislature.”
Spokespeople for Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) and Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana)  did not respond to requests for comment.
Firstly, there’s no consensus on how much the state should spend in total this year. In February, Shapiro proposed a $51.5 billion budget,  about $4.5 billion more than it was projected to take in.
Senate Republicans rejected the number, advocating for a balanced budget that wouldn’t dip into the commonwealth’s roughly $3 billion surplus or $7 billion rainy day funds. They also rejected a budget that passed the House in July that would have cut nearly $1 billion from Shapiro’s proposal.
In August, Senate Republicans passed what they described as a temporary budget, keeping spending largely the same as last year. The move, they said, would allow funding to flow to schools and counties, buying time for lawmakers to settle their differences. Democrats in the House rejected the move, advocating for a comprehensively negotiated budget instead of a stopgap.
Then, there are the disagreements over how much to spend and what policies should change.

“I’m frustrated that they haven’t done what they are, frankly, supposed to do. It’s their one job to put a budget on my desk,” Shapiro said at a press conference Thursday.
He put the onus on Senate Republicans, who he said have failed to meaningfully compromise and convened for too few session days, given the stakes of the fight.
In a statement released earlier this month, Pittman, the Senate Majority Leader, said the transit deal has sped negotiations up. But he added, “while I am encouraged by the meaningful work at the negotiating table, currently there is no global agreement on a budget deal, as several fiscal and policy issues remain outstanding. Reaching consensus swiftly would prevent negative impacts of a budget impasse being shouldered by counties, school districts, hospitals and all those who rely on state government services.”
With mass transit off the table, what else is being discussed?
One budget fight that has been resolved — at least temporarily — is the one over mass transit. 
It’s been 12 years since lawmakers passed a comprehensive solution for funding it with state dollars. But in the time since, costs have increased and the state’s transit agencies have warned they need a new source of revenue or will have to implement service cuts and fare hikes.
For Democrats, it was a top priority, and they advocated for a plan proposed by Shapiro that would have sent an additional 1.75% of the state’s sales tax revenue to the commonwealth’s transit authorities. 
Taking no action could impact transit systems across the commonwealth that serve urban, rural and suburban parts of the state with trains, buses and Shared Ride services.
Republicans, however, did not want to increase state funding for the programs they saw as primarily benefitting urban, Democratic-dominated parts of the state. Instead, they pushed to redirect dollars from a mass transit capital projects fund that is intended for things like replacing old trolleys and buses or renovating platforms.
In August, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), the state’s largest transit authority with roughly 800,000 riders a day, announced it would be implementing service cuts and fair raises, barring a plan from legislatures to increase their share of state funding.
However, a judge ruled that the cuts to train and bus lines disproportionately impacted minority and low-income communities, and blocked them. 
Following the ruling, Democrats caved, and lawmakers passed a bill to redirect the capital projects funding to the state’s largest transit authorities, SEPTA and Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT). The move bought about two years of runway for the legislature to find a permanent solution before the kinds of service cuts the agencies warned about would have to be implemented.
But, as Spotlight PA reported, the solution leaves the state’s smaller transit authorities, which serve primarily rural and suburban areas, without new state funding. Many are considering fare hikes and service cuts.
The impacts could be felt most by those who rely on state-funded Shared Ride programs, which are particularly important to seniors and disabled people in rural areas. The programs are run by transit authorities across the commonwealth, and operate on a deficit.

Rementer, the House Democratic spokesperson, said in a statement, “House Democrats have been clear that any long-term mass transit solution must include new, recurring, and reliable funding to fully fund transit in the commonwealth … We are in this predicament, which will have to be addressed in two years, only because Senate Republicans failed to come to the table with a real solution.”
Republicans have argued that the Public Transit Trust Fund, where the money was taken from, was over-funded, with hundreds of millions that had yet to be earmarked for projects. The solution, they’ve argued, will keep trains and buses running and give transit authorities time to address issues like crime and fare evasion while the legislature debates how best to increase their funding.
Yet even with one of the largest sources of disagreement effectively off the table, a state budget has yet to emerge.
In a press conference Thursday, Shapiro said the Senate and the House “have narrowed the differences,” but, at this point, it’s a familiar refrain.
Other major issues include how to fund public schools. Democrats are seeking more than $500 million additional dollars to be distributed through the adequacy formula that was developed last year.
The formula was a response to a Commonwealth Court ruling that found the previous funding formula was unconstitutionally inadequate, with too large a gap between the state’s richest and poorest schools.
For Democrats, the solution is a gradual ramp-up of funding disbursed though a formula that takes into account factors like poverty levels in a school district and the number of students learning English as a second language.
But Republicans have taken issue with the formula and the amount of state spending directed through it. Some have advocated for a new formula that would ultimately see the state spend less on education.
As for the  policy debates, lawmakers are discussing whether to tax so-called skill games or legalize cannabis, how to reform cyber charter school funding, how much to fund Medicaid following federal cuts to the program, whether to increase the minimum wage, and what the legislature should do to incentivize energy production.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pennsylvania-state-capitol-augus-2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 14:58:41.545302

We’ve landed back in the late 1980s-early 1990s, an era bookended by two pieces of legislation that led to mass incarceration and huge racial disparities in sentencing: the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the 1994 crime bill.

Republican and Democratic states are taking different approaches to using their National Guards to help the Trump administration. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The rhetoric over crime feels as if we’re strapped in a DeLorean and hurtling back to a dangerous future.
We’ve landed back in the late 1980s-early 1990s, an era bookended by two pieces of legislation that led to mass incarceration and huge racial disparities in sentencing: the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the 1994 crime bill. Fear of “superpredators” — later debunked as myth — drove policies to treat juveniles as irredeemable adult criminals. Instead of Willie Horton, now there’s Decarlos Brown Jr.
Fear, denial, and division lead us to cast blame and grasp for outdated solutions. Some voices on the left minimize legitimate concerns over urban violence. On the right, outrage over horrific crimes — such as the tragic, senseless killings of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte and Laken Riley in Georgia — is used to justify mass arrests and deportations, harsher sentences, and threats of more National Guard deployments in cities. Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department has terminated hundreds of grants for violence prevention programs.
This shouldn’t be a partisan debate. After all, the aforementioned federal bills were bipartisan, and the 1994 crime bill was sponsored by Sen. Joe Biden. In his first administration, President Donald Trump signed the First Step Act, which released thousands of inmates from federal prisons and provided programs to reduce recidivism.
The recent rhetoric threatens proven anti-crime programs, argues David Kennedy, a professor of criminal justice at John Jay College, in a New York Times essay on Sept. 10, titled “What Both the Left and the Right Get Wrong About Violent Crime.”
Kennedy points to research showing that violence-intervention strategies have led to falling crime rates in Oakland, Baltimore, and other metros, but also smaller cities like Davenport. Five years ago, the Iowa city’s violent crime rate was twice the national average. With a change in police strategies, shootings are down 46% and violent crime has fallen 24%.
“The good news is that we have proven ways to reduce violent crime, and policymakers around the country are embracing them,” Kennedy writes. “The bad news is that this politicized back-and-forth is taking us away from what we know works.”
What works is recognizing that in cities big and small alike, a tiny group of people in a few neighborhoods is responsible for most of the shootings and other violence. Research in Boston, Oakland, and New Orleans, for example, shows that less than 1% of the population is part of a social network that account for more than half of the homicides, according to Thomas Abt’s 2019 book, “Bleeding Out.”
Abt argues that the first step in reducing urban poverty and improving people’s lives is to staunch the bleeding in these troubled areas. No amount of investment in education, health care, or economic development will turn around a neighborhood beset by violence. “The surest path to prosperity begins with peace,” he writes.
Abt and Kennedy lay out similar approaches: Communities must target those groups and neighborhoods with resources, balancing enforcement, prevention, and treatment. That means a strong police force that gathers intelligence on gang activity, identifies hot spots, and distinguishes between those causing the violence vs. those at risk of joining the shooting or being shot.
But it also requires an army of social workers, gang outreach specialists, ministers, coaches, business owners, grandparents, and others to reach out to “would-be shooters” and offer them alternatives and opportunities. “Like law enforcement, they must work in shifts in order to be available at all hours, they must have adequate communication and transportation that allow them to respond quickly, and they must have access to resources instantly in order to remedy a dangerous situation,” Abt writes.
Yes, it takes a village, and lots of resources.
This strategy led to youth homicides falling by almost two-thirds in Boston during the late 1990s, Kennedy writes.
What doesn’t work is indiscriminate, broad policing that sweeps up all youth in a high-crime community, instead of focusing on dangerous offenders.
“Overenforcement might lead to more arrests and more time in jail and prison, but it will not necessarily result in less violence. In fact, recklessly aggressive policing and prosecution may actually increase violence,” Abt writes, citing research on aggressive drug enforcement.
“Bleeding Out” helped inspire Safe & Thriving Youth: Central Iowa’s Youth Violence Reduction Plan, a initiative by the United Way of Central Iowa. The coalition of law enforcement, social-service providers, and civic leaders in Des Moines has launched a comprehensive strategy to reduce youth violence, support at-risk individuals, and create a safer community.
Such strategies must be led, organized, and adapted on the local level. However, federal and state funding – as well as private-sector support – is necessary to provide the resources needed.
The dividends will spread throughout a city, creating a safer, more just, fair, and prosperous community.
Or we can travel backward, falling back on fear and policies that are as effective as a flaky flux capacitor.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley said he is researching what legal options the state might have against South Dakota, which he said is impeding interstate commerce by banning the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipeline projects. 
Wrigley called the legislation signed into law in March a “hostile act” on a radio talk show this week. 
South Dakota leaders on Friday defended the law that takes away the ability of carbon pipeline developers such as Summit Carbon Solutions to use eminent domain. Eminent domain is a legal procedure to force landowners to provide property easements for projects that benefit the general public. 
Summit’s goal is to build a network of pipelines in five states to capture carbon emissions from ethanol plants and send it to North Dakota for permanent underground storage. The main trunk of the pipeline would run through South Dakota, where Summit has so far been unable to secure a state permit and has met significant resistance from landowners. 
Summit petitions Iowa regulators to remove Dakotas requirement from pipeline permit

North Dakota has approved permits for the pipeline route and the underground sequestration. 
South Dakota state Rep. Jon Hansen, the speaker of the House and a candidate for governor, sponsored the bill that Wrigley opposes. Hansen responded to Wrigley on Facebook: 
“It appears the carbon pipeline lobbyists have found their latest puppet — and now North Dakota taxpayers might be being forced to bankroll a lawsuit against their own neighbors in South Dakota, all to help a private carbon pipeline company,” Hansen wrote. 
“Unlike you, we are standing on the side of our people — defending THE PEOPLE’s constitutional right to private property over an out-of-state company’s desire to take what’s not theirs,” Hansen continued. 
South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office responded to questions about Wrigley’s comments by pointing to the letter the governor sent legislators in March explaining his decision to sign the bill. 
In the letter, Rhoden emphasized his commitment to property rights.
Wrigley did not name Summit in his comments to radio host Scott Hennen on WZFG, The Flag, based in Fargo, but said North Dakota is considering suing South Dakota over its law. 
“Because at the end of the day, the United States has a commerce clause in our federal Constitution, because to have a nation, you have to have commerce between and around and across states,” Wrigley said. 
The attorney general’s spokesperson said Wrigley was out of the office Friday.

Wrigley, as part of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, voted to approve Summit’s sequestration plan. 
North Dakota and South Dakota politics are both dominated by the Republican Party. 
Rhoden, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley and Hansen are all Republicans. 
Wrigley and North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong are Republicans, who also hold a super majority in the Legislature. 
But while Republican opponents of eminent domain gained influence in the South Dakota Legislature, Republican-led bills to curb the use of eminent domain failed in this year’s North Dakota legislative session.  
Wrigley said he also would be reaching out to South Dakota leaders on the eminent domain law, along with Armstrong.  
“I know that he’s going to be a great force and lead around these issues as well,” Wrigley said. 
Jackley provided a statement Friday: “I will defend the laws and People of South Dakota, it’s as simple as that. The Legislature voted for the private property rights by wide margins, and Gov. Rhoden signed it into law. The People of South Dakota voted decisively on this issue, and I will support them.”
In addition to North Dakota, Summit has obtained pipeline route permits in Iowa and for a small section of Minnesota. Nebraska has no agency that deals with carbon pipelines. 
The project would take advantage of federal tax credits for carbon capture. Summit says the project will benefit ethanol producers and the farmers who supply the ethanol plants with corn.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware’s fight against Alzheimer’s disease is entering a critical phase. New data show not only a rising number of residents living with Alzheimer’s, but a cascade of economic, workforce, and health system impacts that are already straining families, employers, and state budgets.
“This is not just a health issue—it’s a statewide infrastructure issue,” said Linda Barba, Senior Manager, Marketing and Communications for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter, in an interview with Delaware LIVE. “As more Delawareans are diagnosed, every part of the care network—from hospitals to employers to family caregivers—feels the pressure.”
A Rapid Rise in Cases
According to the Alzheimer’s Association’s 2025 Facts and Figures report, approximately 23,000 Delaware residents over age 65 are living with Alzheimer’s, up from 22,300 in 2023. From 2000 to 2022, Alzheimer’s-related deaths in Delaware increased by nearly 300 percent, reflecting both a larger senior population and improved detection.
“Age is the greatest known risk factor, and Delaware’s senior population is growing faster than the national average,” Barba said. “That combination means we are seeing more diagnoses, more hospitalizations, and more families needing support.”
Economic and Workforce Strain
The ripple effects extend well beyond the bedside.


Medicaid Pressure: Alzheimer’s drives higher long-term care use and repeat hospitalizations, increasing costs for Delaware’s Medicaid program, which already allocates a large share to aged and disabled services.


Direct Care Shortages: Memory care units, home health agencies, and adult day programs face chronic staffing gaps—particularly in Sussex and Kent counties—delaying hospital discharges and lengthening waitlists.


Employer Impact: As spouses and adult children cut work hours or leave jobs to provide care, Delaware’s midsize employers—especially in health care, education, and state government—see higher absenteeism and turnover.


Hidden Costs: Families frequently spend down savings on respite care, transportation, and home modifications to qualify for Medicaid coverage.


“This is a disease that doesn’t just affect people living with the disease,” Barba said. “It affects the entire economic ecosystem of the state.”
Pressure on Health and Long-Term Care Systems
Hospitals, primary care practices, and long-term care facilities are struggling to keep pace.


Hospital Throughput: ChristianaCare, Bayhealth, and Beebe report longer inpatient stays for people living with dementia due to delirium risks and complex discharge planning.


Primary Care Load: Family doctors are conducting more cognitive screenings and coordinating care without enough dementia-trained navigators, stretching appointment capacity in New Castle and fast-growing Sussex.


Memory Care Access: Demand for secured memory care beds and adult day slots outpaces supply, particularly in rural areas, where long drives and few programs intensify caregiver burnout.


Determining the right care options and resources for a loved one is often one of the most emotionally taxing experiences families face. Lynn Paxson, president of Oasis Senior Advisors Delaware and Eastern Shore, noted that the shortage of a wide-ranging assortment of assisted living and memory care options makes the search increasingly difficult.

“Families frequently reach out in crisis, only to discover that the type of options they want are not available,” Paxson explained. “Even before they call us, many caregivers are already stretched to the breaking point. And when there is availability, long waitlists for specific needs and preferences can be long and costs daunting.”



Behavioral Health Overlap: Shortages in geriatric psychiatry and mobile crisis teams lead to more 911 calls and emergency department boarding when behavioral issues escalate.


Caregiver and Community Impact
For Delaware families, the burden is deeply personal.
“Alzheimer’s care can last eight to eleven years on average,” Barba said. “That’s years of round-the-clock responsibility that takes a toll on physical health, finances, and mental well-being.
Early-stage support can be just as overwhelming. Lori Smith, director of We Care at Milford Wellness Village, said families often struggle simply to figure out where to begin.

“When a parent first starts showing signs of memory loss, it can feel like there’s no clear map,” Smith said. “Families are suddenly faced with a maze of programs, medical providers, and financial considerations. Our role is to help them sort through those options—whether it’s adult day programs, home care, or medical evaluations—so they can make informed choices before the situation becomes a crisis.”

Finding affordable in-home care presents another major hurdle. Patrick Gray, director of Griswold Care, said many Delaware families want to keep loved ones at home but face rising costs and limited staffing.

“The demand for in-home care is exploding, but affordability remains a serious barrier,” Gray said. “Families can be forced to patch together part-time aides or reduce hours because of cost. The hopeful side is that new technology—like remote monitoring, medication reminders, and fall detection—can help stretch care budgets and give families peace of mind when they can’t be there in person.”

Caregivers in Delaware report higher rates of depression and chronic stress, and many struggle to navigate a patchwork of services such as state aging programs, veterans’ benefits, legal planning, and respite care. Black and Latino families in Wilmington, Dover, and Georgetown face later diagnoses and fewer culturally matched services, which can worsen disease severity by the time treatment begins.
Public Safety and Social Services
The disease’s reach extends into public safety and the courts:


Wandering and Silver Alerts are increasing, requiring coordinated responses from state police and local EMS.


Adult Protective Services sees more cases of self-neglect and caregiver burnout leading to emergency placements.


Courts and Guardianship are handling more contested powers of attorney and probate cases as financial capacity declines.


County-by-County Pressures


New Castle County: Higher hospital volume and more urban safety calls, with concentrated needs in Wilmington and aging suburbs like Hockessin, Pike Creek, and Newark.


Kent County: Gaps in specialty care and transportation hurdles to Dover and Smyrna drive heavier reliance on Medicaid long-term services.


Sussex County: Rapid in-migration of retirees is driving the fastest growth in dementia prevalence, outpacing workforce and memory-care capacity from Lewes to Millsboro.


Pathways to Relief
Barba outlined several priorities to ease the burden:


Early Detection at Scale: Normalizing cognitive screening in primary care and pharmacies, with fast-track referrals and navigators.


Caregiver Infrastructure: Expanding respite vouchers, adult day programs, and paid family leave supports.


Workforce Pipelines: Scholarships and career ladders for certified nursing assistants and home health aides, plus mandatory dementia training for frontline staff.


Mobile Supports: Dementia-capable crisis teams, in-home therapy, and technology for wandering prevention and medication management.


Equity and Access: Culturally tailored outreach in Wilmington, Dover, and Sussex’s multilingual communities.


Data-Driven Planning: Updating and funding the state Alzheimer’s plan with county-level targets for beds, respite hours, and workforce growth.


Help for Families
Despite the daunting statistics, Barba emphasized that resources are available. The Alzheimer’s Association 24/7 Helpline (800-272-3900) offers confidential support, crisis assistance, and referrals in more than 200 languages. Support groups, educational courses, and the My ALZ Journey mobile app provide practical guidance for caregivers navigating the disease.
“No one should have to face Alzheimer’s alone,” Barba said. “But Delaware must also face the reality that this is a growing crisis requiring coordinated action from every sector of our community.”

How do I register to vote?
Am I registered to vote?
You can check the secretary of state’s website: You’ll need to enter your name, date of birth and either your California driver license, identification card number or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you don’t have those available, contact your county elections office or the secretary of state via email or phone at (800) 345-8683.If you’ve changed your name since the last time you voted, or if you moved and didn’t notify the Department of Motor Vehicles or U.S. Postal Service, you may have to register again. If you haven’t voted in several consecutive general elections, your registration may have been canceled.
How do I register?
You can do so online here. You’ll need the same information as above.
If the DMV has your signature on file, you’ll be able to complete the process online. If not, you’ll need to print, sign and mail your completed application to your county elections office. You can also pick up a paper application at elections offices, any DMV office and at many post offices, public libraries and government offices. You’ll be contacted when your application is approved, or if you need to provide more information.
What happens if I miss the voter registration deadline?
The last day to register online for the general election is Oct. 20. If you are registering or re-registering less than 15 days before Nov. 4, you must complete same-day voter registration and request your ballot in person at your county elections office or polling location. 
How do I change my political party if I’m already registered?
You’ll need to re-register to vote.
 
 


What if I need help with voting?
What if I need voter information in a language other than English?
The secretary of state’s office has voter instructions in the following languages: Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese. Your county elections office may offer additional languages. 
When will I receive my voter guide?
The statewide voter information guide is available online and will be mailed to voters in September.
What am I voting on?
Gov. Gavin Newsom called a special election to vote on Proposition 50, his measure to gerrymander California congressional districts to favor Democrats in the 2026 midterm election. It’s intended to offset a gerrymander in Texas that Republican President Donald Trump called for to boost the GOP next year’s election.
Can I leave work to vote?
Yes. California requires time off for voting if employees don’t have enough time outside work hours. You can take as much time as you need, but employers are only required to pay for a maximum of two hours.
Employers may require advance notice. The time off must be at the beginning or the end of your shift. Employers are required to post a notice about this 10 days before a statewide election.
How can I track my ballot?
Go online then select “My Voter Status” to check if your vote was counted and if not, what the issue was.

What if I have special circumstances?
What should I do if I marked my ballot wrong, or otherwise messed it up?
If you haven’t turned it in yet, you can exchange your mail ballot for a new one at an elections office, ask an election official at the polling place for a new ballot, or vote using a provisional ballot. If you have mailed or turned in your ballot, there’s no way to fix it. Contact your county elections office for a new ballot. 
What if the signature on my ballot doesn’t match the one on file?
County election officials check the signatures on the return envelope against signatures on your voter registration card to make sure no one tries to improperly cast your ballot. It still remains confidential; the ballot is separated from the envelope before it is counted.
Voters with ballots with missing signatures or ones that don’t match are notified and given an opportunity to correct the problem before the election is certified.
What happens if I don’t receive my ballot?
Contact your county elections office. 
Help! I dropped off my ballot to a drop box in the wrong county.
Don’t worry – the county will pass it on to the correct elections office. 
I forgot to detach the stub from my ballot. Can I open the sealed envelope and reseal it myself?
You can, but the secretary of state’s office recommends contacting your local county elections office. They’ll ultimately be processing your ballot and they can offer the best guidance on whether you should reopen it or just leave the stub attached.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825-2025-VG-FAQ-GH-CM-scaled.png?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 17:26:57+00:00,CT Mirror,U.S. Justice Dept. pushes voter fraud complaints from CT group,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/ct-doj-voter-fraud-complaints/,A CT nonprofit that has filed dozens of unsubstantiated voter fraud allegations now has a powerful new ally: the U.S. Department of Justice.,"Fight Voter Fraud Inc., a nonprofit group based in Middletown, has filed dozens of unsubstantiated allegations with Connecticut officials in recent years claiming that thousands of people voted illegally in the state, forcing investigators to spend hours investigating and debunking the group’s claims.
But the group now has a powerful new ally in pushing its allegations about voter fraud: the U.S. Department of Justice.
In August, a high-ranking official from the DOJ forwarded information compiled by Fight Voter Fraud Inc. to the Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission and demanded that the agency look into the group’s allegations that roughly 14 people have voted more than once in recent elections. 
The DOJ communications were sent to SEEC by Mac Warner, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the DOJ’s civil rights division.
Warner, who previously served as West Virginia’s Secretary of State from 2017 to 2025, has publicly claimed multiple times that the 2020 Presidential election was stolen from President Donald Trump due to actions by the FBI and CIA.
Warner’s communication with the SEEC sets up a unique situation, in which the DOJ is placing its weight behind allegations compiled by an organization that has been criticized in the past for repeatedly advancing unfounded claims based on its misinterpretation of voter registration information and other data.
Stephanie Thomas, Connecticut’s Democratic Secretary of the State, said this week that it was unnecessary for the DOJ to be forwarding allegations of voter fraud to the SEEC. 
“Connecticut already has a system to investigate credible claims through our State Elections Enforcement Commission,” Thomas said in a statement. “Involving the U.S. Department of Justice in these preliminary allegations risks blurring the lines of that process.” 
“Allegations are not evidence, and our voters deserve better,” Thomas added. 
Linda Szynkowicz, the founder and CEO of Fight Voter Fraud Inc., did not respond to a phone call for this story.
And officials with the U.S. Department of Justice did not address how Warner came into possession of the complaints compiled by Fight Voter Fraud Inc.

A DOJ spokesperson also did not answer questions about whether federal officials officially independently investigated the allegations contained in the complaints prior to forwarding them to SEEC, or whether the federal government is asking other states to investigate similar claims of voter fraud from outside groups.
“The Justice Department is committed to upholding the integrity of our electoral system and will continue to prioritize efforts to ensure all elections remain free, fair, and transparent,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the DOJ. 
Clare Kindall, SEEC’s interim director, confirmed her agency received two memos from the DOJ in recent months requesting that state officials investigate allegations produced by Fight Voter Fraud Inc. 
In the first case, Kindall said SEEC did not act on the communication because Fight Voter Fraud Inc. had previously filed the exact same allegations with the agency, and SEEC staff were already investigating the claims that 4,897 people may have voted more than once.
But the second memo, which was sent last month and included claims that another 14 people voted twice in recent elections, prompted SEEC to open a formal investigation this week.
“We take every allegation seriously, and we are handling this complaint within the normal course of business as we do with any other complaint,” said Kindall, who previously served as Connecticut’s Solicitor General. 
“We traditionally have a very good working relationship with DOJ and all law enforcement,” she added. 
The relationship between SEEC and the Fight Voter Fraud Inc. has been more fraught, however. 
Following the 2020 presidential election, Szynkowicz sent SEEC more than 50 complaints alleging thousands of incarcerated people, unregistered adults and underaged teens voted illegally in Connecticut during the election between Trump and Joe Biden.
Those complaints required SEEC staff to devote a large amount of time looking into each allegation. Once those investigations were complete, SEEC took the uncharacteristic step of admonishing the group and its founder for wasting the agency’s time and resources.
“The Commission notes that, while significant commission resources were required to process and definitively disprove the allegations contained in these complaints, complainant could have avoided the waste of these resources if she had ascertained the requirements of the law and the meaning of the data she produced as evidence,” SEEC members wrote in one of the orders. 
“The commission would strongly encourage those who hold themselves out as authorities on election law investigations to educate themselves on both the facts and law of the complaints they file with the Commission to avoid the needless waste of the limited investigatory resources of the Commission,” SEEC added. 
Even after that reprimand, however, additional complaints from Fight Voter Fraud Inc. have flooded into the SEEC, and Szynkowicz has continued to earn nearly $200,000 per year leading the organization, according to IRS records.
The newest complaints from Fight Voter Fraud Inc. rely primarily on data showing that people are registered to vote in two locations, and the group uses that information to claim many of them voted twice.
But as the SEEC pointed out in past cases, people who move can be registered in two locations without casting more than one ballot during an election.
Rep. Matt Blumenthal, who leads the state legislature’s Government Administration and Elections Committee, said he found it odd that the DOJ was using its power and credibility to advance allegations from a group that has frequently made baseless claims about voter fraud. 
“Anyone can submit a complaint or information which can predicate an investigation by the SEEC,” Blumenthal said. “But it is unorthodox that the U.S. Department of Justice would be submitting information.”
Blumenthal pointed out that the DOJ has the authority to charge people for double voting if they believe it occurred, and he questioned why the federal government was forwarding such allegations on to a state agency. 
“The DOJ has immense investigatory powers and resources,” Blumenthal said. “If they had a reasonable basis for thinking these allegations were true, they would have the ability to investigate and prosecute it themselves.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEEC-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s chief financial officer demanded Friday that social media companies be held accountable for creating disappearing messages that handicap child sex trafficking investigations.
Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican and former state senator, accused social media platforms of “destroying evidence” of messages between groomers and minors by installing instant vanishing features across platforms. His comments came Friday, amid a broader legal battle waged by Florida officials trying to impose age restrictions on social media companies.
“A lot of these tech companies are in this state of de facto protecting these predators,” Ingoglia said during a Winter Haven press conference, speaking alongside Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, adding that a case that should be a “slam dunk” for law enforcement is stopped by vanishing messages.
“These social media companies need to be held accountable for destroying vital evidence that law enforcement needs to put these predators in prison,” he told The Florida Phoenix in a phone call later. “It’s severely hindering and handicapping their efforts.”
Ingoglia, appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis as CFO in July, had sponsored a bill during the 2025 session that would have required social media companies to decrypt messages if subpoenaed by a court, and would have prohibited minors from having access to disappearing messages. The measure failed, despite passing the Senate.
This isn’t Florida’s only venture into targeting the social media world. The predominantly GOP-led Legislature in 2024 passed a law banning social media companies from allowing children under 15 years old to create accounts, sparking a massive legal battle between state officials and two trade associations representing social media giants. The law was blocked by an appellate court over the summer, but the case remains pending.
Earlier this year, Uthmeier filed a lawsuit against Snapchat, a social media platform allowing users to send each other photos and messages that can vanish instantly after viewing. He heralded the April case as just the beginning of his continued crackdown on social media platforms, building off of a separate investigation into the gaming platform Roblox.
Other platforms that allow for encrypted messages include Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal.
As a lawmaker, Ingoglia also sponsored a new law funding a grant for law enforcement to ramp up online sting operations to capture and imprison child predators. During Friday’s press conference, which announced 246 arrests of human traffickers, child predators, and prostitutes in just seven days, Ingoglia added that parents need to become aware of the “depravity” of online predators.
“You have no idea of the depravity that is waiting to take advantage, take hold of them, abuse them, and turn their lives upside down,” he said. “Social media companies should stop the encryption of any message that has a minor account so law enforcement can have the proof they need to put these scumbags away for life.”

Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard to push them to release data to the federal government. Judge Teresa Watson will make a decision by Sept. 29 on whether to dismiss the case. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A lawsuit filed by Attorney General Kris Kobach to force Kansas leaders to turn over data requested by the federal government heated up this week with sharply worded filings.
Kobach sued Gov. Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Family secretary Laura Howard on Sept. 9, demanding they turn over personal information of more than 700,000 Kansans who applied for or received food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kobach announced the lawsuit in a news conference the day before.
In a motion to dismiss filed Monday, Kelly and Howard’s attorneys called the action “a sad political stunt.”
“Respondents are following the law, and this case is a sad political stunt by the Attorney General as evidenced by the fact that he chose to litigate via press conference before filing this case or even bothering to confer with Respondents, who would have told him: do not panic, Kansas has a plan to preserve the funding of the State’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, while ensuring the privacy of approximately seven hundred thirty thousand individuals, consistent with data privacy obligations under state and federal law,” the motion said. 
On Thursday, Kobach pushed back in his response: “Respondents have chosen to defy Kansas and federal law and risk millions of dollars that ultimately help the most vulnerable Kansans. It appears that their ‘plan’ is to do nothing and hope that no one will require them to follow the plain text of the law. Their route is neither tenable nor lawful.”
After a hearing on Thursday, Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson said she would make a decision on Sept. 29 regarding the motion to dismiss.
Kelly and Howard’s 191-page motion to dismiss the case reiterates explanations Howard has given that turning over the data may violate privacy rights of Kansans and explained how they are working to resolve the situation.
They pointed to a California lawsuit in which multiple states contend the U.S. Department of Agriculture doesn’t have the right to the requested SNAP data.
On Thursday, the judge in the national case issued a temporary restraining order stopping the USDA from acting on the warning letters it has sent to states that said SNAP funding will be lost.
The state received a letter in August from former Kansas Rep. Patrick Penn, who is now the USDA deputy under secretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, warned that Kansas could lose federal funding for SNAP administrative expenses if it did not submit the data.
Howard has said Kansas officials are concerned about releasing the data and the liability they could face if the California-led lawsuit determines the USDA should not receive the data. 
Kobach’s filings in the case against Howard and Kelly said Kansas statutes require the state comply with the federal government’s request and that their “brazen noncompliance” establishes their guilt.
“Federal punishment aside, Respondents are state officers refusing to follow clear and direct commands within state law, so this mandamus action is ripe,” the Kobach filing said. “Moreover, the State possesses standing to bring its suit, which is anchored in state law that requires Respondents to cooperate with the federal government. Federal law does not prevent the State from seeking injunctive relief.”
In their filing to dismiss the action, Kelly and Howard said the data cannot be “meaningfully” recalled once it is submitted.
“The damage to the privacy and the loss of trust would be immeasurable,” their filing said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170141-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-19 14:00:15.869437

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate) The Arkansas Education Department released public school ratings Friday that were calculated using a new accountability formula for the first time. 
The goal of the revised formula, which still assigns schools a rating of A-F, is “to provide a clearer and more meaningful picture” of student achievement, year-to-year growth and postsecondary readiness, according to a news release. 
Education officials created the new formula to go along with the new state test, the Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which replaced the discontinued ACT Aspire and was first administered to students in spring 2024. The new accountability formula was developed with input from educators and community members, including nearly 400 who participated in listening sessions during the summer of 2023, according to ADE.
Arkansas school rating system should consider additional factors, superintendents say

In a call with reporters Friday morning, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said some of the feedback he received about the previous formula was that many superintendents didn’t have confidence that the letter grades reflected the learning happening in the schools. 
“We wanted to make sure that [the new accountability system] was focused on achievement, it was focused on growth, and we’re making sure we prioritize students that need the most support and it was in a manner that was clear and concise and easy to understand,” Oliva said. 
Arkansas has seen several educational changes as a result of the LEARNS Act, a 2023 law backed by the governor that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system. Among other things, the law raised the state’s minimum teacher salary to $50,000 and created a school voucher program. 
“LEARNS is all about improving the way we educate kids in Arkansas, and our new letter grade formula, alongside the new ATLAS exam, allows us to do that with a better, more full picture of where each of our students and schools stand,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in the news release.
Rep. Keith Brooks, a Little Rock Republican who co-sponsored the LEARNS Act, backed another law during the 2025 legislative session that required ADE to establish a new accountability system for public schools to “align with the educational priorities” of the LEARNS Act. 
The new law required ADE to issue grades under the new system for the 2024-2025 academic year. If schools did not maintain or improve their letter grade under the new system, the law allows them to request a review by the education department’s Division of Public School Accountability. 
For the 2023-2024 school year, ADE provided districts with simulated grades based on the first administration of the ATLAS test so officials could better understand the new formula before official grades were issued, according to the news release. 
Letter grades released Friday for the 2024-2025 academic year mark the first time schools have been officially ranked under the new system. Slightly more than one-third of schools received a “C.” Nearly 12% received an “A” and 12.6% received an “F.”
When the previous formula was last used during the 2022-2023 academic year, more than 40% of schools received a “C.” Roughly 7.7% received an “A” and another 7.6% received an “F.”

Although the formulas differ, Oliva said schools that received an “A” under either system likely had high-quality learning and programming, while “F”-rated schools probably had broken systems. The confusion with the previous system was with the middle rankings because “those confidence levels were very narrow,” he said.
“This is a more clear, concise process now to say we’re more confident that we feel like this is a better reflection of learning that’s happening in schools,” Oliva said. 
Under the updated formula, the highest score a school can earn is 900, and one-third of each school’s rating is based on the students’ performance in English language arts, math and science on the ATLAS exam, according to ADE. 
Two-thirds of elementary and middle school ratings and more than one-third of high school ratings are based on the extent to which students are meeting their individualized growth targets each year. High school scores will also measure whether students are graduating on time and demonstrating postsecondary readiness. 
Arkansas’ school accountability system transitioned from a 1-5 scale to a letter grade scale about a decade ago with the passage of a 2013 law that aimed to clarify the rating system for parents. The previous formula used for calculating the letter grades was based on a 300-point system and developed by the University of Arkansas’ Office of Innovation for Education in consultation with ADE and educational leaders, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. 
The law creating the A-F scale went into effect in the 2014-2015 school year. Then in 2017, Act 930 and Act 744 aligned the state’s accountability systems with federal requirements and permitted the use of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) School Index score as the universal score for accountability.
Oliva said education officials will use the letter grades to identify state resources like literacy coaches.
“We want to make sure the schools that aren’t getting learning gains and achievement levels are getting the right layers of support … how do we make sure we’re moving the needle forward because ultimately our goal is to eliminate failure,” he said.
A school’s letter grade affected students’ eligibility for the Educational Freedom Account program during the first two years of the school voucher program. Students enrolled in an “F”-rated school were eligible to participate in the 2023-2024 academic year. Eligibility expanded to students enrolled in a “D”-rated school for the 2024-2025 academic year. The EFA program opened to all Arkansas students this fall and more than 46,600 students had been approved to participate as of last week.
The new school ratings were released to superintendents Thursday, according to ADE officials. They will be available to the public on ADE’s website Friday afternoon and on the MySchoolInfo dashboard in October.

I’ve seen firsthand how they help prevent disease and reduce hospitalizations.,"Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

I was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi just four minutes from the Walgreens where I now work as a pharmacist. Some might say my roots in this community run deep.
My family owned a group of independent pharmacies in the area for years, and when they were ready to exit the profession, Walgreens gave me the opportunity to continue doing what I’ve always known: caring for my community through pharmacy.
Today, I serve as a district immunization lead, which means I often lead local vaccine clinics and outreach efforts across the region. It’s a role that allows me to expand my impact beyond the pharmacy counter and bring care directly to the communities that need it most.

A big reason I’m so passionate about preventive care is because I’ve seen firsthand how vaccines can make a difference and how the absence of one can lead to regret.
I recently counseled two patients who are twins about the importance of getting the shingles vaccine. One accepted my recommendation and got vaccinated. The other declined. About a month later, the patient who didn’t get the vaccine came into the pharmacy with shingles.
The patient immediately expressed regret and wished they had gotten the shot. I walked them through when they’d be eligible to receive it, and they’re now planning to get vaccinated. That experience reminded me why I chose this profession — to help people make informed decisions that protect their health. 
Mississippi has long struggled with low vaccination rates, and this year, I’m especially concerned.
Misinformation is making it harder for people to trust the principles of how vaccines protect us. I hear it every day: “I’ve never had the flu, so I don’t need the shot.”
But the truth is, flu vaccines aren’t just about individual protection. They’re about keeping our hospitals from being overwhelmed, reducing treatment costs and protecting our most vulnerable neighbors, including children, seniors and those with chronic conditions.
At my store on the east side of Mississippi, we take care of a lot of patients who need vaccines. I’ve worked hard to build trust with my patients, and they rely on me to make sure they’re getting the right care.
That trust is something I don’t take lightly. We host onsite vaccine clinics and do everything we can to raise awareness about the importance of getting vaccinated – especially in more rural areas where hesitancy is higher.
The misconceptions around flu vaccines aren’t new, but they’ve been amplified in recent years. That’s why it’s more important than ever to have honest conversations with your pharmacist – someone who knows your health history, your concerns and your community.
Getting a flu shot is quick, easy and one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and those around you.
I trust vaccines. I’ve seen firsthand how they help prevent disease and reduce hospitalizations.
And I’ll continue doing everything I can to make sure my neighbors in Mississippi have access to the care they need — starting with a simple flu shot.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 16:38:45+00:00,CT Mirror,Hartford HealthCare offers $86M for 2 Prospect Medical CT hospitals,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/hartford-healthcare-ct-prospect-medical/,Hartford HealthCare’s offer for Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals will serve as the minimum bid in the bankruptcy auction.,"Hartford HealthCare, one of the two largest health systems in Connecticut, has offered $86.1 million to purchase Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals from Prospect Medical Holdings, the California-based operator that filed for bankruptcy protection in January. 
ECHN Holdings Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford HealthCare, will serve as the “stalking horse bidder” for the two hospitals in the court-supervised sale auction, according to court documents. The “stalking horse” serves as the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Other bidders may submit offers through Oct. 16. A sale hearing, where the bankruptcy court judge will approve the preferred offer, is scheduled for Oct. 24. 
Prospect Medical Holdings paid $105 million when it purchased the two hospitals in 2016. 
Tina Varona, a spokesperson for Hartford HealthCare, said in an emailed statement that the health system is “excited to explore this opportunity” and “uniquely qualified to transform healthcare for the better in these communities.”
“We have the capability to stabilize and expand the workforce at these hospitals, provide support to enhance quality and safety, and advance strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities, and community partners,” Varona wrote. “Given Prospect’s restructuring proceedings, this is a complex process that will unfold over the coming weeks.”
Deborah Weymouth, president and CEO of Eastern Connecticut Health Network and Waterbury Health, called the bid an “important step” in the sale process.
“We are proud of the exceptional care we provide daily and equally excited about the promise of our future,” Weymouth wrote in an emailed statement on Friday. “Achieving this milestone demonstrates the value that we continue to contribute to our communities and brings us closer to starting a new chapter.”
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the governor has been focused on ensuring the facilities “transfer to new sustainable long-term operators that will benefit the communities they serve and their incredible staff.” The administration is “very encouraged that Hartford HealthCare has stepped up to help provide continuity of care in the region,” he added.
If Hartford HealthCare prevails in the sale auction, the deal will have to go through the state approval process, known as “certificate of need,” which is overseen by the Office of Health Strategy. OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time required to approve a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
During the most recent legislative session, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the emergency certificate of need timeline, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete. 
The acquisition would further expand the footprint of one of Connecticut’s largest health systems.
Hartford HealthCare currently owns a total of seven hospitals across the state, the most of any health system in Connecticut, and earned roughly $6 billion in revenue in 2023. By comparison, Yale New Haven Health had higher revenue in 2023, $6.4 billion, but only owns four hospitals.
The bid announcement marks the latest ownership development, after months of silence, for Prospect’s three hospitals in Connecticut — Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury Hospital
Earlier this week, the state-owned University of Connecticut Health Center announced that it would submit a bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. The move is part of a broader strategy by Connecticut’s only public academic medical center to expand its footprint. UConn is also seeking to acquire Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals as part of that deal. 
[RELATED: CT in talks to buy Bristol, Day Kimball and Waterbury Hospitals]
“We are working with multiple parties that are interested in acquiring Waterbury HEALTH and we expect to advance a stalking horse bid on this portion of our Connecticut operations shortly,” Weymouth, the CEO, stated in emailed comments.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, who works as a physician at Manchester Memorial and serves as the co-chair of the state legislature’s Public Health Committee, welcomed the announcement, calling it an opportunity to “reduce private equity’s presence in state healthcare.”
“This is incredibly welcome news for health care in the state of Connecticut. I fully endorse and encourage Hartford HealthCare’s bid to purchase these hospitals, which would preserve local community care in Manchester, Vernon and their surrounding towns and cities,” Anwar wrote in a statement released on Friday.
Vernon mayor Dan Champagne said Hartford HealthCare’s offer brings “new hope” to the community.
“For years we have been working hard to secure Rockville Hospital’s future and this is a major step towards that,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-19 16:34:23+00:00,CT Mirror,BOEM seeks revocation of SouthCoast Wind approval,Anastasia E. Lennon | The New Bedford Light,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/19/boem-seeks-revocation-of-southcoast-wind-approval/,"If a federal judge approves the request, it would deal a critical blow to the offshore wind project located 20 miles south of Nantucket.","The Interior Department agency regulating offshore wind development asked a federal judge on Thursday to revoke a key approval for the SouthCoast Wind project — an approval granted by the same agency in January in the final days of the Biden administration.
If the federal government’s request is approved, it would deal another blow to the beleaguered project — which has been delayed at least two years due to the Trump administration — and the industry at large. 
This is the second time in a week that the administration has sought a remand of an offshore wind project approval, the other being for Maryland’s US Wind project. It comes just weeks after the Interior Department in court filings expressed its intent to remand not only its approval for SouthCoast Wind, but also New England Wind — two important projects for Massachusetts and New Bedford. 
[RELATED: Trump administration halts CT offshore wind project]
While the January approval, formally termed the Construction and Operations Plan (COP), gave the green light for construction, SouthCoast Wind was still hamstrung by three outstanding federal permits, and no power purchase agreement with Massachusetts or Rhode Island. 
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management filed the motion as part of a lawsuit brought by the Town of Nantucket in March against BOEM and Interior’s approval of the project, which calls for up to 147 turbines and would sit about 20 miles south of Nantucket (and south of Vineyard Wind). 
This latest move illustrates the growing role that lawsuits brought by municipalities and activist groups against offshore wind are playing in President Trump’s crackdown on the industry. Of the 20 or so actions and orders issued since January, one has directed federal attorneys to review pending litigation against projects and consider a remand of permits that the litigation contests. 
“BOEM is reviewing its approvals associated with the Project and has determined, based on its review to date, that it wishes to reconsider its COP approval. That is reason enough to grant a remand,” the new motion states. 
Nantucket is asking the federal government to “set aside” its record of decision approving SouthCoast Wind and restart its environmental review — a process that took more than three years to complete and culminated in key permits allowing the project to move toward construction. 
In Thursday’s filing, the government suggested the town’s concerns (and lawsuit) may become moot: “BOEM likely will take a further agency action, and that action may affect — and possibly moot — Plaintiffs’ claims.”
The motion and a declaration filed by BOEM Deputy Director Matthew Giacona are littered with references to Trump’s day-one wind memo and the subsequent actions that it has borne.
This includes the withdrawal of a 2021 opinion on how the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) should be interpreted, and the reinstatement of an opinion from the first Trump administration on the law. The motion states that BOEM staff are reevaluating all agency decisions that relied on the since-withdrawn 2021 opinion, which also informed the approval of New England Wind.
Under the reinstated opinion, Giacona said, SouthCoast Wind’s COP approval may not be compliant with OCSLA. 
“BOEM determined that it ‘may have failed to account for all the impacts that the SouthCoast Wind Project may cause,’” the motion states. “BOEM also found that the Environmental Impact Statement and other record documents may have ‘understated or obfuscated impacts that could have subsequently been improperly weighed in making the determinations.’”
Giacona’s declaration also appears to call into question the lease itself, which SouthCoast Wind paid millions for and has been paying hundreds of thousands in annual payments to the federal government since. 
He said the project-wide review, ordered under the day-one wind memo, “could result in identifying potential issues with SouthCoast’s lease” and that the timeline for that review is “uncertain.” 
Ocean Winds North America, the project’s parent company, in a statement to The Light said it plans to “vigorously defend our permits in federal court.” 
“SouthCoast Wind’s Construction and Operations Plan (COP) was approved … after a rigorous four-year review,” the statement read. “This review reflected an extensive public process that incorporated feedback from federal and state government agencies, commercial ocean users, Tribal Nations, and many other stakeholders. Stable permitting for American infrastructure projects should be of top concern for anyone who wants to see continued investment in the United States.”
SouthCoast Wind is an intervenor in the case and opposed the government’s motion. The project plans to use the Port of New Bedford for staging out of the Marine Commerce Terminal and for long-term operations and maintenance. 
Mayor Jon Mitchell previously said a delay or cancellation of New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind could mean a loss of up to 200 jobs in the city.
According to Oceantic Network, an organization supporting the industry, SouthCoast Wind expects to invest $6 billion in the U.S. through wages for union labor; shipbuilding with a Louisiana port and shipbuilder; steel from Alabama and Kentucky; and investments in port infrastructure, including the New Bedford terminal.
Gov. Maura Healey, in an emailed statement Friday, said the project will create “thousands of good-paying jobs” and provide reliable, affordable power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. 
“This project has been thoroughly vetted and has already undergone years of expert review,” Healey said. “There is absolutely no need for the Trump Administration to reopen permitting processes and deny jobs, investment and energy power to the states.” 
Healey’s office did not respond to a question as to whether it plans to intervene. 
The request for a remand will be decided by a federal judge.
Per the federal government’s filing, “District courts have broad discretion to grant or deny remands and may deem a remand inappropriate ‘if the agency’s request appears to be frivolous or made in bad faith,’” but it also says courts “commonly” grant them. 
As this plays out, more than a dozen states, including Massachusetts, are waiting on a federal judge to rule whether Trump’s first-day wind memo, the action underlying all of this, is unlawful. It’s unclear when that decision will come, and what scope of relief it could provide to the states, which are relying on the projects to meet climate mandates and rising grid demand.

But the historically Black university, which has not been involved in the city’s ongoing lawsuit until now, was not forced to court over the issue. Instead, the university was the one who filed a grievance. It sought Wingate out for help with what it described as an insurmountable roadblock: Ted Henifin, the federal water receiver, who was refusing to permit the project to move forward. 
“It has an enrollment effect on us, a morale effect on us, and most important, an operational effect on us,” Vance Siggers, the director of campus operations, told Wingate, adding that each time the university experiences days without water, it loses “somewhere between 50 and 100 students just on the basis of we don’t have water on campus.”

The two sides mostly talked past each other during the Thursday proceedings, with Jackson State contending that it was not attempting to build its own water system for human consumption. The university has been working on this project since the 2022 water crisis disrupted the fall semester for weeks. 
Henifin, backed by testimony from the Mississippi State Department of Health, responded that the university’s plan for the backup tanks did not follow safety regulations. That’s in part because, during emergencies, health officials said the plan would route nonpotable water through the same pipes the university normally uses to deliver potable water to the kitchen and dormitories. 
“Looking back, it would have been great to work with them from the very beginning,” Henifin said. “At the end of the day, Jackson State hired an engineering firm and they should have reached out to the health department. … It’s engineering malpractice that they got this far along.” 
Wingate began the proceedings by reading aloud a Sept. 11 letter he received from the university’s lobbyist. The letter described how Jackson State has a looming deadline to spend $8 million in pandemic relief funds administered by the Department of Finance and Administration to install four water tanks on its campus as part of a plan designed by a local contractor, the Pickering Firm. 
Those tanks, which can’t be returned, are currently sitting unused on state property because Henifin will not sign a document that the Mississippi State Department of Health needs in order to formally review Jackson State’s plans. 
Instead, the letter portrayed Henifin as pulling strings with the health department to block the project. JSU claimed Henifin had wrongly surmised that the university was attempting to build its own water system. 
“Our goal is not to create a new water system but to ensure access to backup water tanks to prevent our students from experiencing water shortages,” Jacqueline Anderson-Woods wrote to Wingate, hoping the plea would lead the judge to force JXN Water’s approval
Over the next three hours, Wingate attempted to unpack the disagreement, an effort that involved testimony from Henifin, Siggers and Bill Moody, the director of the health department’s public water supply division. 
The university argued it does not want to build an independent water system and will continue to draw from the city’s water system and pay its bills. 
“This is not an independent water system, this is a backup water system,” Siggers said. “We still have to cut those 18 payments a month that I will sign off on every month.” 
Siggers described what he envisioned: During periods when issues with the city’s water system resulted in low water pressure on campus, the university could trigger the backup water tanks to keep its cooling and heating systems going.
Students could use the backup water to flush toilets and shower so they did not have to leave their dorms to use portable toilets, such as during the 2022 water crisis. Dining hall staff could continue to use the water to keep the kitchen clean. 
“It is important that we keep a certain level of PSIs on campus for student use in residence halls such as flushing toilets, shower needs, and washing,” he said. “Over in the dining facility, it is used for back-up such as maintaining cleanliness in the dining facilities while we serve our students.”

When the university reached out to Henifin after learning he was blocking the project, Siggers said they did not receive a response. Henifin even ignored a letter from Alfred Rankins, the commissioner of the university’s board, the Institutions of Higher Learning, in support of the project. 
In response to Siggers’ testimony, Henifin told Wingate he was “very confused” because as far as he knew, there was no way in the proposed design for the university to separate nonpotable water that goes to a shower from potable water that goes to a bathroom sink. 
“They don’t have a dual-pipe system where they can put nonpotable water into their system and only go to toilets for flushing,” Henifin told Wingate. “If it goes into a shower, people open their mouths when they shower.  Nonpotable water is not allowed to be used in showers in buildings.”
Henifin also noted that if Jackson State is storing unused water in these tanks for months, bacteria or other contaminants are likely to grow. That means if there is a possibility students could consume the water, the university must treat it — which requires obtaining the necessary regulations, hiring a water operator and conducting regular testing. 
“As the protector of Jackson’s water … I cannot sign off on anything that may cause people to have contaminated water,” he said. 
The first Henifin learned of the project was when the contractor reached out to ask about an “infrastructure tie-in,” he said.  He added that he thought improvements JXN Water had made to the city’s delivery system, including winterizing its facilities, meant Jackson State no longer needed to pursue this project. 
This testimony led Wingate to call on the Mississippi State Department of Health. Bill Moody, the director of the department’s bureau of public water supply, told Wingate he had determined that regardless of university’s intent, it was seeking to build a system intended for “consumptive” use. 
Moody had informally reviewed the plans, which the university had not provided to him until he issued a cease-and-desist order on the project in May. 
“The plans that I’m looking at fully indicated the water would be flowing into the tanks and flowing back out into the building using their pipes,” Moody said. 
Moody added the university could solve this if it routed the water from the tanks solely to mechanical systems like HVAC, so that students do not risk consuming the nonpotable water. 
Another solution would be for the university to become a public water system, a legal designation for a system that delivers drinkable water to more than 25 people for at least 60 days out of the year. 
But Jackson State kept reiterating to Wingate that it did not want to become a public water system because it did not intend for students to drink its backup water, despite the testimony from the health department that its plans would result in students consuming nonpotable water. 
“This goal is to be achieved by installation of above ground tanks on the customer side of existing taps to distribute water to dining services, campus housing, the student health center,” said Monica Davis Allen, an attorney for the university. “The intention is to ensure continuous campus operation and not for human consumption.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird is leading a group of states in advocating for free speech on college campuses and calling on university leadership to not give into the “Assassin’s Veto,” according to a letter released Thursday.
The letter cautions college officials against stifling free speech and debate in the name of protecting it through unfair or disproportionate security measures and costs. This move comes after the Iowa Board of Regents directed public universities to quickly investigate and censure, up to job termination, employees alleged to have posted negative comments about right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.
Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University during a public debate event.
“The tragedy of Charlie Kirk’s assassination is a sobering reminder that the right to free speech must be protected,” Bird said in a press release on the letter. “Charlie was murdered while debating on a university campus, a place where the free exchange of ideas should be encouraged; we cannot allow the actions of an assassin to stop free speech in any way. Colleges and universities must take steps to keep their students safe while preserving free discussion and open debate.”

Citing 1992 U.S. Supreme Court case Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, the letter stated requiring “exorbitant” security fees for certain groups or events based on the content or viewpoint expressed by the speech can go against the First Amendment.
The letter cited the University of New Mexico’s attempt in 2023 to impose security fees totaling more than $5,000 on Turning Point USA — co-founded by Kirk — for an event hosted by the organization where “conservative speaker” Riley Gaines was set to appear. A judge issued a preliminary injunction against the college for the fees, the letter stated.
University security policies must be transparent and nondiscriminatory, the letter stated, and security fees must be decided upon in a “content-neutral and viewpoint-neutral manner.” Facility use policies should follow these rules as well, and ensuring the safety of eventgoers and participants should be handled by the institution rather than act as a barrier for certain types of speech, it added.
If universities advertise themselves as being open for public speech and debate, placing more scrutiny and fees on conservative speakers and events — or refusing to host them altogether — while not doing the same for politically neutral or liberal speakers could also violate state Consumer Fraud Acts or Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws, the letter stated.
Bird was joined in signing the letter by attorney generals of 16 states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah. Each of the state leaders will investigate any complaints relating to these topics made against universities, the letter stated.
“We trust that you will continue to take steps to keep your campuses safe,” the letter stated. “And we also trust that you won’t use safety as a pretext to silence debate, at a time when it is sorely needed.”

Though still below pre-pandemic levels and its 2000s peak, Vermont’s growing prison population has caused overcrowding across the system. The state is assessing its options.

With Vermont’s prisons reaching capacities they haven’t hit since the onset of Covid-19, Vermont Department of Corrections officials are grappling with how to handle the influx of people incarcerated. 
The state now incarcerates more women than it has beds at its lone women’s prison. In some facilities, people are sleeping on temporary plastic “sled beds” on cell floors. The growing population means prison officials are now considering sending more people to a private prison in Mississippi. 
In just two years, Vermont’s prison population has risen by almost 300, from 1,366 in September 2023 to more than 1,650 today. To be sure, the level is below the roughly 1,750 seen in 2019 and a peak of more than 2,200 in the late 2000s. State data shows the detainee population — people jailed while awaiting trial — is rising more rapidly than the sentenced population.
At the same time, Vermont’s prisons have experienced persistent staffing shortages. This week, WCAX reported on a lack of officers at Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport leading to continued mandatory overtime for staff. That facility’s vacancy rate for officers and shift supervisors is 28%, while the state’s five other facilities have vacancy rates between 10% and 20%, according to department data.  
According to Joshua Rutherford, the department’s facilities division deputy director, the state always expected the prison population to rise.
“Starting this spring, that has accelerated, and we started to fill up faster than we had anticipated,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Nobody calls me to ask how many beds I have before they impose a sentence.”
Plans to reopen three units in three different prisons this month should help ease the problem, Rutherford said. Those units had been shuttered during Covid due to staffing shortages and a decreased population. But with some people forced to sleep on temporary floor beds, and the state’s only women’s prison now over capacity, the situation requires immediate action and creative thinking. 
Why are more people in prison?
Corrections leaders, lawmakers and Vermont’s chief superior court judge have all suggested a combination of factors contributing to the spike. Pandemic-era policies meant fewer police interactions and some people released from prison — initiatives that have since ended. Some crimes, both violent and nonviolent, have increased. 
Public and political demands for more accountability have increased, too, as concerns about crime in downtowns — particularly in Burlington — have grown. 
The Vermont Legislature has also created new and stricter crimes. In July 2024, Vermont’s bail laws changed, allowing judges to increase the amount of bail for defendants who were accused of crimes while out on release in other cases. 
Chief Superior Court Judge Thomas Zonay told lawmakers last week that that change may be increasing the number of detainees. He compared recent bail data to that from May 2024. Over that time, the number of people held on less than $10,000 bail increased by more than 60%, or about 50 people. A similar increase wasn’t seen in other bail amounts that were unlikely to be impacted by the recent legislation. 
About 40 more people are held without bail now than were in May 2024, a number that reflects people held for serious felony charges. 
The confluence of changes means that for the first time in years, Vermont’s prisons are overfull or close to it. 
Data from this week showed all of Vermont’s six prisons had at least one general population unit at or over capacity. 
At the women’s prison, Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, 180 women were squeezed into a facility with only 118 general population beds and 164 currently operating beds.
The 183 women incarcerated across Vermont as of Thursday is also more than the 158-bed plan previously proposed for a replacement women’s prison and reentry facility.

 A similar pattern appears across the system. Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland, Northeast Correctional Complex in St. Johnsbury, Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town and Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield all have general population units detaining more people than the number of available beds, according to Department of Corrections data. 
Overcrowding leads to ‘ugly’ conditions
For Rutherford, the corrections official focused on population, the spike in people incarcerated is forcing him and colleagues to come up with less-than-ideal solutions. 
In the past, the state utilized prisons’ gymnasium space for extra beds. The department is already utilizing temporary plastic beds on the floor of cells.

When the state’s prisons reach capacity, Vermont sends people out of state. Through the state’s contract with CoreCivic, one of the country’s largest private prison companies, Vermont sends just under 130 men to Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi — about half of 2019’s out-of-state population. 
The CoreCivic contract currently allows Vermont to utilize up to 300 beds, but only for men — meaning overcrowding at the South Burlington women’s prison poses a trickier problem at the moment. 
“Increased reliance on out-of-state (prisons) is absolutely a possibility,” Rutherford said, specifically referencing the male population.  
Tim Burgess, an advocate for incarcerated people in Vermont, experienced overcrowding himself while in prison in the state in the 2000s. At the time, the Department of Corrections was utilizing sled beds.
“Picture a red sled like you use to go sledding. It’s a little longer, it looks a little like a narrow canoe. If you’re a larger person, it is about as comfortable as you’d think it would be,” he said. 
In a tight two-man cell, furnished with a bunk bed, a desk and toilet, the person in the sled bed typically finds themself wedged somewhere near the toilet. 
“It’s ugly,” Burgess said. 
Matt Valerio, Vermont’s defender general, said sled beds are a sanitary issue. He said recent instances of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria MRSA at the Rutland prison, where the temporary beds have been utilized, has caused concern.
(A department spokesperson said there were a “small number” of MRSA cases system wide this summer, declining to provide specifics due to medical privacy concerns.) 
After 25 years on the job, Valerio is familiar with the era when Vermont incarcerated far more people and sent hundreds more out of state. 
“The biggest issue I see right now is we have a massive detention population,” he said. The more than 650 people currently detained while awaiting trial is two or three times higher than in the past, according to Valerio. 
The overall upward trend in incarceration, Valerio argued, could be traced in part to political and public pressure in response to concerns about public safety. That pressure can swing the pendulum in instances where there’s discretion — judges issuing bail, the Department of Corrections releasing people on furlough and the parole board approving parole, he said. 
To Valerio, it was a “no brainer” that the state’s prison population would rise from pandemic lows. “The real question is how high is it going to go. And what’s going to happen — where are we going to put them?”

The U.S. immigration court system does have a backlog of nearly 3.8 million cases as of the third quarter of 2025. But, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, the average wait time for all cases was about 1.7 years as of earlier this year.
Asylum cases take much longer, however, with the National Immigration Forum reporting in early 2024 an estimated wait time of 4.3 years. There are nearly 2.4 million asylum seekers’ cases pending as of the third quarter of 2025.
The backlog is driven by the high number of applications, especially from people seeking protection from persecution, a shortage of immigration judges and support staff, and frequent policy changes that complicate proceedings. Even with recent efforts to hire judges and create new processing dockets, the system is still overwhelmed.

Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, said the state should explore creative solution to bringing down the costs of covering GLP-1 drugs in health insurance plans.(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Expenses have surged for Louisiana’s public worker health insurance plans as more people are prescribed GLP-1 drugs, known by brand names such as Ozempic and Mounjaro. The diabetes drugs are now commonly thought of as weight-loss medications, though that use isn’t covered by Louisiana state health benefits.

Even with GLP-1 coverage prohibited for obesity treatment, the state Office of Group Benefits spends $200 million per year on the drugs and is “adding people everyday,” CEO Heath Williams said Thursday at legislative finance committee meeting.

“We’re going to go Ozempic-broke,” Sen. Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, said. 
Over the past six years, GLP-1 drugs have replaced Metformin, a cheaper, but sometimes less effective, Type 2 diabetes drug. By comparison, Metformin cost the state $2 million annually when it was doctors’ go-to prescription, Williams said. 

“We are moving members from very inexpensive drugs to very expensive drugs – to the tune of $20 drugs to $1,200 drugs per month,” he told lawmakers. 
The Office of Group Benefits provides insurance coverage to 212,000 people, including state employees, public school teachers, some local government workers, their family members as well as public sector retirees. Its expenditures are around $2 billion per year, and the money comes partly from premium payments plan members make. 
Legislators approved contracts Thursday with new pharmacy benefit managers, who help negotiate drug prices for insurance plans. The contractors, Livinti and SilverScript, will be required to provide more transparency about what is driving the high number of GLP-1 prescriptions being written, Williams said 

Earlier this year, legislators approved a state budget that would have covered the cost of GLP-1 prescriptions for public workers to treat obesity, but Gov. Jeff Landry vetoed that provision.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
“These drugs can cost $1,000 a month per person,” Landry wrote in his June letter to state lawmakers explaining the veto. “Even temporary coverage could set expectations for long-term use that Louisiana simply cannot afford.”
Legislators attending Thursday’s meeting blamed pharmaceutical companies for the high cost of GLP-1 drugs, saying the same medications cost far less in other countries. 

Cloud said the state should consider a workaround where compounded versions of GLP-1s – essentially copycat versions of the medication that are more affordable but not vetted by federal officials – would be covered by the state health insurance plan.
“To me, that is our only path forward right now is to figure out how to cover [the compounds],” Cloud said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned earlier this month against using compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs however. The agency has not reviewed the compounds for safety, effectiveness and quality. 

“A compounded drug might be appropriate if a patient’s medical need cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug, or the FDA-approved drug is not commercially available. However, compounded drugs are not FDA approved,” the agency said in a statement released Sept. 5.
Such compounded versions are already used broadly in the public because the medications’ costs are high and insurance coverage is limited.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_1289-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 11:59:40.356313

A federal judge ruled Friday that Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine can participate in next weekend’s Homecoming parade, as long as they comply with the university’s parade policy.


In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephen Bough noted that while the court finds that the organization must be permitted to participate in the parade, nothing in the order prohibits the University of Missouri from enforcing the requirements of the parade policy.


Earlier this year, the university updated its Homecoming parade policy to exclude political expression. The new policy also denies participation of organizations that don’t adhere to the parade’s “black and gold” theme.
According to the updated policy, “the purpose of the Homecoming parade is to celebrate Mizzou and its supporters. It is not a venue for protests.”
Todd McCubbin, executive director of the Mizzou Alumni Association, told the judge during a hearing Tuesday that the organization’s 2025 application would likely be preliminarily approved, and the Office of Alumni Engagement would work with the group to ensure it complied with the parade policy.


Last month, Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine sued Mun Choi, president of the University of Missouri System, to secure a place in the parade.


In the lawsuit, the group argued that Choi violated the students’ First Amendment rights by forbidding them to participate in the parade because of their views on Israel and Palestine.


In his ruling, the judge agreed with the organization that there is more than a “fair chance” that Choi’s denial of their participation in the parade violates the First Amendment.

In the Tuesday hearing, Choi ‘s legal team argued that the denial was largely based on safety concerns. They  cited two prior incidents involving a member of the group that resulted in a student conduct charge for stalking and a restriction that limits her presence on campus to academic purposes.


The legal team also noted incidents of violence at student protests on other university campuses nationwide as part of Choi’s rationale.


The court agreed that safety is a “significant [governmental] interest,” but aside from the instances involving one group member, could not find that Mizzou Students for Justice in Palestine had violated any university policy.


Thus, Choi’s decision to exclude the organization on the basis of safety could not be supported.


According to the ruling, “Dr. Choi’s decision to exclude the organization in its entirety is not narrowly tailored to the stated interest of safety. Dr. Choi ‘could, instead, forbid the specific student(s) giving rise to [safety] concerns’ from participating.”


Thus, assuming the Homecoming parade is an unlimited public forum, the court found Choi’s decision had been too narrowly applied.


Ultimately, the court decided that there was little evidence that the students had been engaged in or connected to any form of violence, and that denying their participation in the Homecoming parade would likely be a violation of the First Amendment’s free speech clause.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)“Property values are going to go down, utility bills are going to go up as a result. And I think there’s a huge issue when it comes to, one, putting these lines through communities,” U.S. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, told the State Corporation Commissioners and a packed school auditorium of local residents Thursday night at the first SCC public hearing about Dominion Energy’s proposed high-powered transmission lines, which slated to cut through Northern Virginia neighborhoods.
Hundreds of community members in the three Loudoun Valley Estates neighborhoods showed up  to the hearing to push back against plans for the 500kv lines to be built in their backyards. Dominion has told state regulators the lines are necessary to bring more energy to data centers. All three commissioners listened to the worries of community members, many of whom have been mounting a vigorous campaign to educate the public about what the project could mean for their home values and safety.
The 165 foot towers would carry power from substations in the area to complete the “reliability loop of power” that will help energize  hundreds of data centers just outside Ashburn, in  so-called Data Center Alley.
“My power needs are being met. These are being built for the rapidly expanding data centers. So let the data center industry pay for this solution, not the families and ratepayers living under the power lines,” said Jatinder Chandok, a resident of Loudoun Valley Estates. 
The Golden to Mars transmission line will be the final piece of the loop. Two-thirds of it have already been approved and are in different stages of development. There are six different routes Dominion proposed to the SCC for the Golden to Mars line but some face more challenges than others.
Golden to Mars
Two of the proposed lines for the last part of the loop, routes three and four, run along Loudoun County Public Schools property near Rock Ridge High School and Rosa Lee Carter Elementary School. The school board has rejected the lines being near school property and the SCC can’t make the schools put the lines on their property. 
“(Route 3) remains our preferred route, and we are hoping to begin another conversation with the Loudoun County Public Schools,”  Rob Richardson with Dominion said at Thursday’s meeting.
Some residents spoke of wanting the lines to be buried underground, and signs with slogans supporting that solution dot the front yards of homes surrounding the area. Dominion has said that burying the lines is too costly, there isn’t enough land available for the lines to run underground, and there are underground utilities that could get in the way. 
“The lack of land for transition stations is one (issue). The presence of diabase rock, which impacts construction, and other underground utilities are another. One significant issue also is the time to construct it would take longer than is needed,” Richardson said.
If the school board does not change course, then the lines would have to go through another proposed route that cuts through the yards of some of the Loudoun Valley Estates residents, who live atop the hill next to the high school or along the Loudoun County Parkway. They fear the health impacts of the high-voltage lines being so close to their homes, and are concerned they may be forced to leave or see their home values tank. 
The county Board of Supervisors previously voted against routes one, two, and five because they believe the look of the powerlines along the parkway do not fit the aesthetic character of the area. They also suggested that any lines that come within 500 feet of a school or home should be buried, which would be an unenforceable recommendation. One of the board members, along with several of the homeowners, said this could be a chance for Dominion to set an example of responsibility by burying lines as power demands grow.
“An investment in a pilot program to underground part of this line will provide a new approach to minimizing and mitigating the impacts on residential communities that will be increasingly impacted by transmission lines to serve data centers,” Loudoun County Supervisor Laura TeKrony said. “Loudoun County has lower taxes because of data centers, but data centers are lowering the value of the county as a desirable place to live because of the industrialization that transmission lines and substations are creating.”
A number of state lawmakers have urged the SCC to consider if the line at the center of the controversy is truly needed and to conduct independent research into the feasibility of burying all the lines.
Dominion has stated that if this power loop is not completed, it could damage their equipment and create an energy gap for the data centers. There is also the possibility of violations from the grid operator PJM for not providing that power.
Commissioners said that over 1550 pages of public comment have been submitted on this case already. A second public hearing is being held at the Rock Ridge High School on Sept. 29 ahead of the December case in Richmond. A decision on the powerlines is not anticipated until 2026.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0333-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 11:59:40.356313

This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.
Pennsylvania is due to receive US$2.2 billion dollars from the national opioid settlements, and a new database shows the public where that money is going.
Starting in 2021, a national, bipartisan coalition of attorneys general, including now-Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, reached settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors who had directly contributed to the opioid addiction crisis.
That year, over 5,000 Pennsylvanians died from unintended drug overdoses. That number has since dropped, falling to about 3,300 in 2024.
The opioid settlement payments, which began in 2022 and are slated to continue until 2038, are supposed to fund opioid overdose prevention, treatment, harm reduction, recovery support and other programs. This includes a broad array of interventions in Pennsylvania, from first-responder training for law enforcement to handle people who have overdosed to stigma reduction education and support for medication-assisted treatment, to name just a few.
We are researchers from Penn State University, Temple University and the University of Pittsburgh who helped build a website, which launched in August 2025, that publishes and tracks opioid settlement fund spending data in Pennsylvania.

Disclosure: Jonathan Larsen receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust. He is the Chair of the Haverford Township Democratic Committee. Amy Yeung receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust Dennis Scanlon receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust. Renee Cloutier receives funding from the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust.

We are partnering with the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust, the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Career Development Association. Our team receives funding through the Pennsylvania Opioid Misuse and Addiction Abatement Trust to help the trust with data collection, analysis and web design. However, our website is separate and independent from the trust.
Here are five things we believe Pennsylvania residents ought to know about the spending data, and how it can be used to improve public health:
1. Counties are in the driver’s seat
Out of the 48 states that have received settlements so far, Pennsylvania is one of nine states that have given majority control of settlement spending to local governments.
In Pennsylvania’s case, 70% of the funding goes to counties. Cities and other organizations that were involved in the lawsuits, such as county district attorney offices, get 15%. The remaining 15% goes to the state.
This means that in Pennsylvania, it is mostly up to counties to determine how to best spend the US$2.2 billion. Counties must interact directly with their communities through requests for proposals to distribute funds. They will face critical decisions about how to invest the funds in ways that move beyond pilot programs to sustainable, system-level change.
Requirements from the opioid settlement to spend at least 85% of the money on opioid abatement aim to avoid pitfalls of the 1990s tobacco settlement, when funds were often diverted to general budgets and spent on programs unrelated to getting people to quit smoking.
States that have not given majority control of settlement spending to local governments have created a variety of ways to spend the money. These include a mix of state and local disbursement, as well as special fund-governing bodies charged with deciding how settlement funds are distributed. In some states, the state is the primary decision-maker about how settlement funds are used.
The requirement in Pennsylvania that opioid settlement funds are primarily sent to counties creates an opportunity for local innovation. It will also, eventually, allow experts to evaluate the effectiveness of this local control of funds compared with state control or other structures.
A screenshot from the Pennsylvania Opioid Settlement Data dashboard shows that Philadelphia has so far spent about $20 million of the $80 million it has received, with nearly $6 million going toward the city’s housing programs for people experiencing homelessness. Pennsylvania Opioid Settlement Data
2. Website improves transparency and accountability
When members of the public can see where the money is going, they can hold systems accountable for using the funds effectively. County leaders, meanwhile, can see what programs are currently being funded in other counties that they may want to replicate or scale up.
3. Spending is a marathon, not a sprint
Settlement dollars are just beginning to be distributed and spent. According to the tracker, over $80 million had been spent on approved opioid remediation programs as of Dec. 31, 2024. Settlement payments will continue over the next seven to 18 years, varying by company.
This is a marathon and not a sprint, so communities and decision-makers will have to balance spending that produces short- and longer-term objectives.
Additionally, not all counties are receiving the same amount of money, and that affects what they can do with it.
4. New challenges will arise in opioid crisis
Emerging issues in the opioid crisis will continue to evolve, such as how contaminants like the animal tranquilizers xylazine and medetomidine, or products derived from kratom, a tropical tree, have entered the street drug supply in recent years.
Systematically tracking data will help expand our knowledge base of all programs in Pennsylvania that aim to address the opioid crisis. Some of these programs are based on strong existing evidence, while others will help to build new evidence, especially considering the ever-changing landscape of the crisis.
5. Funding gaps will remain
Opioid settlement funds are an important opportunity to address the opioid crisis, but will not on their own cover all funding gaps needed to address the crisis or the broader public health crises that are its major drivers. These include food and housing insecurity, unemployment, lack of access to mental health care, and so many other related issues.
As the country faces major and rapid federal disinvestment in states and communities, these funding gaps will grow and increase the pressure on local decision-makers to make the most of each dollar while demonstrating evidence of impact.

Nonprofits, such as those that get federal money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, are distributing rent assistance payments that are 14% higher than in 2024 and 49% higher than in 2020 to keep pace with rental costs. Now, the average rental subsidy given across all Connecticut regions is over $1,000.
The annual Point-In-Time Count of Homelessness report, which referenced the data, said, “these agencies that provide rental subsidies … continue to face an uphill battle trying to bridge the gap from what someone can afford versus how much they can subsidize. Also there continues to be a struggle for the providers to find units whose rents are within the FMR [Fair Market Rents] and/or reasonable, thus further draining the pool of available and acceptable units.”
Connecticut ranked eighth-highest in the nation in 2024 for the cost of rental housing.
Homeless people who are employed average $1,800 in earnings a month. Those with some employment and other income, such as social security, average $1,400 a month.

RJ May, R-West Columbia,  listens from the back of the House chamber during an organizational session on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024 at the Statehouse in Columbia, SC. (Photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — In the messaging chats, users asked, “What are you into?”
“Small,” replied user joebidennnn69 on March 31, 2024, according to court documents.
“Bad moms,” the same user said three days later, apparently using slang for mothers sexually abusing their children. “Bad dads. Bad pre teens.”
“And vids with sound in English,” the user added.
Prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney’s Office of South Carolina claim former Rep. RJ May, a West Columbia Republican and founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, was behind the joebidennnn69 account. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of using it to send videos of children being sexually abused.
How former Rep. RJ May is preparing from jail for trial on charges of sending child sex abuse videos

Summaries of chat logs, a map of users’ internet addresses and a list of other activity on May’s devices included in court filings this week give the most detailed picture so far of the case prosecutors plan to build against May during his trial, which is scheduled to begin Oct. 9.
May, who is representing himself, is attempting to get much of the evidence thrown out. He argues that an investigating agent made contradictory statements when seeking warrants used to search his house and get data directly from messaging site Kik.
A previous attorney for May suggested a political enemy could have hacked into his internet to send the videos. And May has said in messages sent from his jail cell, using a monitored tablet, that he expects the prosecution’s case to fail because his devices had no videos of child sex abuse saved on them.
In handwritten court filings, May asked U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, who is presiding over the case, to either throw out all evidence found on the 35 electronic devices seized from his home in August 2024 or allow prosecutors to use only what was found on the phone itself, not in any apps.
May is also asking to change the location of his trial out of Columbia, citing the extensive news coverage of his case, according to a court filing that included dozens of stories from local, statewide and national news outlets and blogs.
Meanwhile, the case’s prosecutors are asking Currie to allow them to reference videos beyond the 10 that May is charged with sending, as well as additional chat messages and internet searches, according to court filings.
Former Rep. May to represent himself in trial on charges of sending child sex abuse videos

May objected to the request. May and prosecutors will argue their motions Wednesday in front of Currie.
Prosecutors charged May with distributing 10 videos of children being sexually abused, but the Kik account prosecutors claim he operated had 220 distinct videos stored, investigators have said. The user sent messages containing those videos 21 times in group chats and 458 times to individual users over the course of the five days the account existed, according to court filings.
“The videos showed infant and toddler children being subjected to severe forms of sex abuse; some of the videos included physical violence and abuse involving animals,” the court filing reads.
The videos and messages are “all a part of a single five-day child pornography spree,” prosecutors wrote. Taken together, they show the videos were sent intentionally and involved preparation, the court filing reads.
May remains in the Edgefield County jail without bond. If he is convicted, he could spend between five and 20 years in prison for each of the 10 charges he faces, Currie has said. Conviction could also mean paying thousands of dollars in fines, she said.
Messages to users across the globe
On April 3, a user whose internet address appeared to be based in the United Kingdom messaged joebidennnn69, “Got any moms and daughters?”
“Yeah,” replied joebidennnn69, from South Carolina. “Send 3 and I’ll go find it. You got more mom daughter?”
Messages from joebidennnn69, including those containing videos of child sexual abuse, went to 46 different users in 18 states and five different countries, according to court filings.

A registered nurse in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was arrested and charged with receiving and possessing child sexual abuse material last month after investigators determined he was one of the users exchanging videos with joebidennnn69.
It’s unclear whether any of the other users believed to be sending and receiving videos over Kik have been charged.
Investigators used distinctive internet signals, known as IP addresses, to trace the users across the globe. In the same way, they pinpointed the joebidennnn69 account to May’s home and cellphone, according to court filings.
Using the Wi-Fi at May’s West Columbia home, the joebidennnn69 account sent 432 videos and images over the course of five days. Another 19 were sent using cellular data connected to May’s cellphone. And 28 were sent over a virtual private network, or VPN, to encrypt the location data, according to court filings.
After asking about preferences or requesting certain content, users often spent hours sending videos back and forth, usually in groups of two or three, according to eight chat logs prosecutors included with their court filing. The videos ranged in length from 14 seconds to just over two minutes, prosecutors wrote.
During May’s June detention hearing, the attorney representing him at the time argued an unnamed political enemy had hacked into May’s home Wi-Fi using a password visible in the back of a photo May’s wife posted on Facebook and sent the videos.
That person would have also needed access to May’s phone over the same five days to account for the other messages, prosecutors have argued. May’s phone received more than 450 notifications from Kik during that five-day span, according to the court filing.
His phone’s data showed the app was deleted April 4, 2024.
Simultaneous messages
May’s internet activity during the Kik conversations helps tie him to the messages, prosecutors argued in a court filing.
Several times, a topic would come up in a Kik chat, then appear in the search history on May’s laptop.
One Kik user, on April 4, 2024, asked joebidennnn69 for “hebe,” a shorthand for hebephilia, which is a sexual preference for children between the ages of 11 and 14. Two minutes later, a search appeared on May’s laptop for “hebe meaning,” followed by searches for hebephile and hebephilia, according to court filings.
During his detention hearing, investigators said May likely didn’t know the meaning of the term because the videos sent through joebidennnn69 suggested a preference for younger children.

Soon after another user told joebidennnn69, “You need to get telegram,” on April 1, 2024, a search for the encrypted app showed up on May’s laptop. His phone downloaded the app less than an hour later, then received login codes, according to court filings.
Telegram, along with encrypted apps Mega and Sessions, were deleted from May’s phone around the same time as Kik, investigators said. Unlike Kik, which is based in the United States, the other apps have headquarters overseas, making search warrants impossible for investigators to get. And unlike Kik, messages sent over those apps are encrypted, a special agent testified during the detention hearing.
Some of the messages seemed to coincide with other activity on May’s phone and laptop, including work for his consulting firm, Ivory Tusk Consulting, and legislative research, implying May was the one using the devices at the time, according to court filings.
On April 3, 2024, May sent an email from his laptop to a political consultant and a fellow legislator. Twenty seconds later, the joebidennnn69 account responded to a Kik message about a “trade” with, “If you got good stuff.”
Within seconds, May followed up on his email with a text message, as videos rolled into the Kik account, along with the message, “Like this?” The joebidennnn69 user responded almost immediately with two files, one of which is included in the videos May is charged with sending.
Six minutes later, May’s laptop registered a Google search for “Fauci and Biden,” apparently referring to former President Joe Biden and his chief medical advisor, Anthony Fauci.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

(Photo by Julia Tilton / The Daily Yonder)At a dock along the banks of the Cousins River, Chad Strater loaded up his small aluminum workboat with power tools and a winch. Strater, who owns a marine construction business, was setting out to tinker with floating equipment at a nearby oyster farm. On the quiet morning in August, with the sun already beating down hard, his vessel whirred to life, only without the usual growl of an oil-guzzling motor. The boat is all electric.
Just north of where the Cousins River meets Casco Bay, Willy Leathers was powering up his own electric watercraft, which had its first outing in July. Leathers uses his 28-foot boat for cultivating oysters at Maine Ocean Farms, where roughly 3 million of the animals grow in dozens of floating cages.
Both Strater and Leathers said they switched to electric workboats for several reasons. Their new watercraft are a cleaner alternative to the smelly, polluting petroleum-powered vessels that dominate Maine’s 3,500 miles of coastline. Electric propulsion is also significantly quieter than a gas or diesel motor. For Leathers, whose 10-acre sea farm is a significant presence in the cove where he operates, the swap is about being a good neighbor to the shoreside community.
“It’s an innovation born from necessity for us,” said Strater about his electric boat, which he docks each night at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, the nonprofit boatyard and aquaculture innovation hub he runs with several other small business owners. “[The boat] really works well for what we do with it, and we’re letting farmers use it to see how it could work for them.”
Battery-powered vessels are starting to catch on in the United States and worldwide as companies and maritime authorities work to reduce emissions and improve the experience of cruising waterways. The technology ranges from small outboard motors on workboats and recreational watercraft to powerful inboard systems on ferries, tugboats, and supply vessels for offshore wind farms and oil rigs.
In recent decades, Norway, with its extensive coastline and ample government funding, has spearheaded the transition globally. China, which is both the world’s largest shipbuilder and battery manufacturer, has rapidly deployed hundreds of battery-powered vessels over the last several years. Falling battery costs, better technology, and stricter environmental rules are compelling some vessel owners to install partial or fully electric systems, primarily for watercraft that operate near the shore or on fixed routes. For commercial fishing in particular, customers are helping to drive the push to clean up.

“Everyone’s more concerned now with where their food comes from, and we’ve seen that [consumers] are looking for that complete sustainable supply chain,” said Ed Schwarz, the head of marine solutions sales in North America for Siemens Energy, which has built electric propulsion systems for U.S. ferries.
Electrification has only very recently come to America’s aquaculture sector. In Maine, the small but fast-growing segment includes nearly 200 farms for shellfish, fin fish, and edible seaweed. Strater and Leathers are among the first in their business to trade gas motors for electric propulsion — a switch they say they’re hoping to accelerate. Oil-guzzling motors are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the state’s multibillion-dollar seafood sector.

Still, electrifying commercial watercraft can be a difficult course to navigate, given the higher up-front costs of electric motors and the lack of charging infrastructure — and grid infrastructure in general — in rural waterfront communities.
Early adopters like Strater and Leathers said they hope the experiences gained from their demonstrations can help pave the way for decarbonizing Maine’s blue economy.  With the help of the Island Institute, a Maine-based nonprofit that works on marine-related energy transitions, Leathers is collecting performance data from his vessel to share more broadly with the industry.
“People say it looks cool and shiny and looks like it operates great,” Lia Morris, the Island Institute’s senior community development officer, said of electric boats. “But we really want to be able to prove out the [business] case.”

Electric boats can cost between 20% and 30% more than a gas- or diesel-powered vessel of a comparable size. However, owners can save on maintenance and fuel over the long term, Strater’s business partner Nick Planson said.
“The high-level math that we’ve come up with” is a financial break-even point of “about four to five years, and then over a 10-year time span, you’re definitely coming out way ahead based on the vastly reduced maintenance cost, replacement cost of failed equipment, and fuel costs,” said Planson.
But the initial price tag presents a significant hurdle. Strater and Planson’s sleekly designed, no-frills watercraft cost $100,000 to build and outfit with a single electric outboard motor. Leathers’ boat, called Heron, cost about four times more. It has two electric outboards and a ramp for unloading and hauling more than 10,000 oysters at a time from the sea farm to distributors waiting on the dock. Its hull is also equipped with a small cabin and toilet.
Both operations relied on grant funding to defray the expense of going electric.
For their part, Strater and Planson used about $50,000 from a larger U.S. Department of Agriculture small business grant they got in 2024 to establish a use case for electric workboats in the aquaculture industry. Leathers’ business, Maine Ocean Farms, was included on a collaborative $500,000 U.S. Department of Energy grant last year that earmarked about $289,000 for boat building and propulsion systems, in addition to other funds for charging infrastructure and data collection.

The prospects for funding future projects are now much murkier under the Trump administration, maritime policy experts say.
The DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which awarded the money to Maine Ocean Farms and its partners, is facing significant budget cuts in the next fiscal year. The GOP-backed spending law that passed in July rescinded some unobligated grant funding for cleaning up marine diesel engines. While other programs were spared, it’s unclear whether the current Congress will approve new funding for initiatives ranging from electrifying huge urban ports to deploying low-emissions ferries in rural communities.

But federal grants aren’t the only way to address the higher cost of electric boats. Strater and Planson also worked with Coastal Enterprises Inc., a Maine-based community development financial institution focused on climate resilience, to establish a “marine green” loan program that can make the up-front costs of switching to electric propulsion more accessible to small businesses.
“The more electric engines that are being employed in Maine helps lift the whole tide for everyone,” said Nick Branchina, director of CEI’s fisheries and aquaculture program. As part of its marine green lending, CEI offers loans starting at $25,000 for small businesses to make the switch to electric propulsion and comfortably afford the cost of batteries or a shoreside charging installation.
Planson said that as electrification moves beyond initial grant-funded projects, the challenge is keeping systems affordable. He said he wants to see other small business owners able to “take a reasonable swing” at electric propulsion.
Buying a boat, of course, is only the first obstacle. Electric vessel owners must also learn how to use their new propulsion systems and find a place to charge them.
This summer, Leathers said he’s had no trouble making the nearly two-mile round trip from the slip where he docks Heron in South Freeport, Maine, to his farm on Casco Bay. With a full charge, he can make trips slightly farther to meet distributors closer to Portland. But as temperatures drop this winter, Leathers said he’s not sure how far the outboards’ two batteries will take him. Cold weather can reduce battery capacity and impact performance, shrinking an electric motor’s range. It’s a part of Leathers’ demonstration to find out what the impacts are in practice.

Like Leathers, Strater and Planson also work year-round. They said they’re both impressed with how their boat performed last winter after launching in the fall of 2024. For Planson, who markets battery-powered equipment to aquaculture farmers as part of his startup, Shred Electric, a boat’s ability to run through the year’s coldest months is a key selling point.
“The proof is in the pudding,” said Planson. “When you’re working with … waterfront applications, it really needs to work every day and all year.”
Strater and Planson said their boat’s range was an important consideration when they partnered with the startup Flux Marine to build the electric outboard motor. With limited shoreside charging infrastructure in place, the boat has to make it out and back on a single charge, sometimes to aquaculture operations seven miles away. In the 10 months since the boat’s launch, Strater has learned range correlates to speed. He can modulate the boat’s pace depending on how far he wants to go.
“We can go really fast for a short distance. We can go really slow for a long distance, and it works for what we do with it,” he said.
Soon, Maine’s early adopters will have shared access to a higher-capacity Level 2 charger that will be installed at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation and can charge batteries in little over two hours, or three times faster than the current system. The startup Aqua superPower was awarded a portion of the DOE funding last year to install additional marine chargers there and at a wharf in Portland owned by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Island Institute also helped with grant funding for the charger at the Sea Meadow boatyard.

Maine will need much more high-capacity charging infrastructure for the marine industry to transition to electric propulsion, said the Island Institute’s Morris. As the state’s aquaculture and fisheries industries look to grow beyond small-scale operations, other businesses will need to charge more frequently to make longer, farther trips up and down the coast.
Expanding charging stations north of Casco Bay represents what Morris calls a “chicken and egg” problem: a dynamic where chargers are either installed before demand gets high, and sit unused, or electric boats hit the water and there’s not enough charging infrastructure, stalling future adoption.
This challenge is compounded by both New England’s aging grid infrastructure and the remote nature of some of the region’s waterfront access points. Getting the right amount of power to a charging station on the shore can be costly, even in Yarmouth, which sits on Casco Bay. Often it’s the last mile that can be the most expensive. At Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, three-phase power, which can accommodate higher loads, is limited by the dirt road that separates the boat launch from the more heavily trafficked U.S. Route 1.
“There are a lot of complicated questions,” Morris said. “I don’t think it’s unique to Maine, it’s any rural area, but complicated questions and conversations with the utilities and the rural municipalities are going to have to be solved for.”
Back on the water, Leathers docked his electric boat, Heron, alongside the sea farm’s barge, where thousands of oysters pass through for processing on harvest days. He switched the motor off and hopped onto the floating platform. For a moment, the bay was calm to the point of near silence. Then Leathers picked up an oyster cage with a rattle, turning it over in his hands as water splashed out. The sounds of the workday began.
“As a whole industry, I think it’s going to take proving that someone like us can do it,” Leathers said. “And then the next person kind of snowballing after that.”

,DC,2025-09-19 14:49:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Chance of government shutdown rises as US Senate fails to advance spending bill,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chance-government-shutdown-rises-us-senate-fails-advance-spending-bill,,"This report has been updatedWASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate deadlocked Friday over how to fund the government past a deadline at the end of September, escalating the odds of a shutdown and heightening tensions on Capitol Hill. Democrats blocked a seven-week stopgap spending bill that had passed the House just hours earlier, refusing to aid Republican leaders in getting the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation. Republicans also blocked a Democratic counter-proposal, a one-month stopgap bill that included several health care provisions. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters ahead of the votes that Democrats can either accept the GOP-drafted stopgap bill or shut the government down. President Donald Trump told Republicans they did not need to negotiate with Democrats on the legislation.“The choice is pretty clear. It's going to be funding the government through a clean, short-term continuing resolution or a government shutdown,” Thune said. “And that's the choice the Democrats have. The House has acted. The president's ready to sign the bill.”Complicating matters is the congressional calendar, which has both chambers out next week for Rosh Hashanah. The Senate’s not scheduled to return until Sept. 29, with less than 48 hours to broker a deal and get it to Trump’s desk. Thune said he’s not inclined to bring senators back early, despite the impasse.  “I’d say it’s unlikely we’ll be in next week but, obviously, you never completely shut the door,” Thune said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters following his chamber’s vote on the stopgap he hadn’t decided whether to reconvene the House earlier than planned.“There’s a lot of discussion about it,” Johnson said. “The members have a lot of work to do in their districts as well, and so we try to balance those interests.”House Republicans announced later in the day the chamber wouldn’t come back until Oct. 1, essentially jamming the Senate with the GOP bill. Shutdown appearing more likelyDemocratic leaders have vowed not to help Republicans get the votes needed on their current stopgap — a stark contrast from March, when Senate Democrats did just that, leading to significant frustration from their House colleagues.The stalemate and congressional calendar have ratcheted up the odds of a protracted, deeply political government showdown that could last for weeks or even months. Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said during floor debate the only path away from a shutdown runs through bipartisan negotiations. “Why aren’t they willing to just meet and actually start charting a course on how we move forward? I think the main reason is Donald Trump,” Murray said. “He told Republicans, ‘Don’t even bother dealing with Democrats.’ It seems like Republican leaders are just afraid to cross the aisle and have a simple meeting, a mere conversation, if it risks losing Donald Trump.” Murray said that approach to governing will have significant consequences for major legislation, which requires the support of at least some Democratic senators to advance in a Senate with 53 GOP members. “So to get things done for our families back home, Republicans need to work with Democrats,” Murray said. “And if Republican leadership cannot find the courage to do that on what should be low-hanging fruit here, if they can’t sit down with our Democratic leadership to talk about a short-term CR, what does that mean for the work that we’ve been doing for our full-year spending bills? What does it mean for extending those health care tax credits? And what does it mean for any of the other challenging issues we would all like to work on together to address?""Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told reporters it’s “malpractice” and “bananas” that GOP leaders don’t plan to shorten or cancel the break. “What I'm hearing is that we're not here next week. Like, are you kidding me?,” Murphy said. “You have all the evidence you need that Republicans want a shutdown — A, they refuse to negotiate and B, they’re sending us home for the week before the government shuts down. This seems like a planned shutdown as far as I can tell. “There’s zero effort — zero — by Republicans to try to solve this.” House passes billU.S. House Republicans passed the seven-week stopgap government funding bill earlier Friday.The 217-212 vote represents the second time this year the House approved what’s called a continuing resolution on a predominantly party-line vote. Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden was the only member of his party to support the bill. Kentucky Reps. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz were the only Republicans to vote no. House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the stopgap spending bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to pass the dozen full-year government spending bills and called it the “responsible path.”  “We are certainly moving forward productively and a bipartisan, bicameral agreement is firmly within our grasp,” Cole said. “We just need more time to sustain negotiations and complete our work.

Jared Golden was the only member of his party to support the bill. Kentucky Reps. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz were the only Republicans to vote no. Senate passage is highly unlikely at the moment. Democratic leaders in that chamber have vowed not to help Republicans who control the chamber get the 60 votes needed to move past procedural votes — a stark contrast from March, when Democrats did just that, leading to significant frustration from their House colleagues.The Senate is expected to take procedural votes later in the day on the House-passed GOP bill and Democrats’ counter-offer. Neither likely will get the votes needed to move toward final passage. There is a strong possibility both chambers leave Capitol Hill afterward for their one-week Rosh Hashanah break. They’re scheduled to return on Sept. 29, with less than 48 hours to broker a deal and get it to Trump’s desk. The stalemate and congressional calendar have ratcheted up the odds of a protracted, deeply political government showdown that could last for weeks or even months. ‘We just need more time’House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the stopgap spending bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to pass the dozen full-year government spending bills and called it the “responsible path.”  “We are certainly moving forward productively and a bipartisan, bicameral agreement is firmly within our grasp,” Cole said. “We just need more time to sustain negotiations and complete our work.

Public Utilities Regulatory Authority Chairwoman Marissa Gillett resigned her post as Connecticut’s top utilities regulator on Friday, ending a tumultuous tenure for the agency chair as the state sought to rein in sky-high energy prices.
The decision was announced by Gov. Ned Lamont’s office on Friday. It comes just five months after lawmakers confirmed Gillett to a second 4-year term on the authority that was soon followed by the governor reappointing her as chair.
In a statement, Lamont called Gillett “one of the most experienced and qualified public utility regulators in the country.”
“Her breadth of knowledge, analytical skillset and experience in energy policy, combined with her commitment to fairness and her ability to navigate complex cases were beneficial to our state and ratepayers,” Lamont said. “Marissa brought an outsider’s perspective and a fresh set of eyes to help advance our policy goals of bringing cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable power to the people of our state.”
According to the governor’s office, Gillett’s last day will be Oct. 3.
In her own statement that was shared by the governor’s office, Gillett thanked her colleagues at PURA, where she has served since 2019.
“With the help of PURA’s amazing staff, my fellow commissioners and I have championed an approach that provided rigorous but fair scrutiny to utility rate increase requests and other matters,” Gillett said. “I can confidently say that we fulfilled our statutory mission and held the regulated utilities to a high standard of accountability.”
Gillett had faced mounting scrutiny from both the utility companies and state lawmakers over her management practices, with critics accusing her of wielding unilateral control over the ratemaking process.
At the time of her resignation, Gillett and PURA were facing multiple lawsuits from the state’s two largest utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid, the parent company of United Illuminating.
On Thursday, House Majority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, called for the opening of formal impeachment proceedings against Gillett after the Hartford Courant reported on the existence of emails that he described as evidence Gillett had sought to curtail the authority of her fellow commissioners.
During a confirmation hearing earlier this year, Gillett had denied having any such policy.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0220_SR_PuraHearing_105-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

(Screenshot from droughtmonitor.unl.edu)The area of New Hampshire experiencing “extreme drought” conditions tripled over the last week, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
By area, 22.82% of the state was facing extreme drought as of Tuesday, Sept. 16, according to the report, released Sept. 18. That’s up from 7.33% as reported by the drought monitor on Sept. 11. The affected area expanded within Grafton County, dipped further into Merrimack and Sullivan counties, and stretched across Carroll County, also extending into pockets of Coos and Belknap counties.
Extreme drought is characterized by water shortages and increased fire danger, and can be accompanied by widespread crop failure, according to the National Weather Service. Growers across the Northeast are anticipating losses, according to the National Integrated Drought Information System. New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone said the state recommends individuals and municipalities take measures to conserve water.
Even in areas where extreme drought has not been declared, much of the rest of New Hampshire is experiencing drought of lesser severity. About half of the state’s area, including bands above and below the extreme drought zone, are experiencing “severe drought,” while most of the remaining portion of southern New Hampshire is in “moderate drought,” according to the monitor. Another 6.1% of the state’s area, in the southern portion of Hillsborough and Rockingham counties, is considered “abnormally dry.”
Drought conditions in late summer are consistent with a general trend of wetter springs and hotter, drier summers in the Northeast, Stampone said.

He said the Guard can help law enforcement. Others disagree with sending federalized troops to patrol U.S. cities.,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly, a retired Mississippi National Guard officer, is supporting President Donald Trump’s efforts to mobilize National Guard troops to Washington and other cities around the country to crack down on crime. 
Kelly, a Republican who has represented northeast Mississippi in Congress since 2015, said about 200 members of the Mississippi National Guard are still in the nation’s capital, and he believes the troops have sufficient training to aid law enforcement officers in the city. 
“It’s part of our civil response,” Kelly said of the Guard. “We know how to do that mission. They’re not law enforcement. They know what they can and can’t do. They’re supporting law enforcement.” 
The president has threatened to send troops to other cities he believes have problems with violent crime. Opponents of this policy say the use of federal troops for domestic law enforcement violates federal law and usurps individual states’ sovereignty. 
Kelly, a Saltillo resident, first joined the National Guard at the age of 19 in 1985. He mobilized for Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2009. 
In 2018, Kelly was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In 2020, he was promoted to major general and designated as the state’s assistant adjutant general. Earlier this year, he retired from the Guard. During his tenure in the Guard, he was one of the highest-ranking members of the military serving in Congress. 
He told Mississippi Today in an interview at his Capitol office that he has met with about 15 members of the Mississippi unit in Washington, and all of them said they were enjoying their assignment. 

Rep. Trent Kelly
“They were on their off time,” Kelly said. “They came by, and we gave them a Capitol tour. It was informal.” 
Following the governors of at least three other Republican-led states, Gov. Tate Reeves last month announced he was deploying Mississippi National Guard troops to Washington to bolster Trump’s “effort to return law and order to our nation’s capital.”
The move comes after Trump signed an executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. Washington’s elected officials and several Democratic lawmakers have disputed these claims, noting that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump’s first term in office. 
After he mobilized the National Guard in Washington, Trump deployed troops to Memphis,  with the support of Tennessee’s Republican governor and U.S. Senators. The president has also suggested sending troops to Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.
State leaders have speculated whether Reeves or Trump would send Guard troops to deal with crime in Mississippi’s capital city. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a media briefing earlier this month, called Jackson a “Democrat-run city” in a conservative state and labelled it a “sanctuary city.”
“While Jackson is not formally a sanctuary city, the state of Mississippi formally banned sanctuary cities, and this city has acted as a de facto sanctuary city for criminals and illegal aliens since 2017,” Leavitt said. 
But Reeves’ office, in a social media post, said he has not deployed the Guard to Jackson because he has previously worked with the state Legislature to expand the role of the Capitol Police force in the area and has signed legislation into law creating the Capitol Complex Improvement District Court, a state-created inferior court in the state’s capital city.  
“The Governor’s holistic approach to fight crime in Jackson — admittedly using tools not available to the President — is working,” Reeves’ office said. 
U.S. Rep. Mike Ezell, a Republican who represents South Mississippi and a former sheriff, also said the president’s use of the Guard is a “good strategy” because the mere appearance of military members could be a deterrent for crime. 
“I’ll tell you from my own personal experience being a sheriff, being chief of police, if you have a crime problem, and think about what you hear from the police chiefs and the sheriffs,” Ezell said. “‘We don’t have enough manpower. We don’t have enough manpower.’ We hear that. We’ve heard that forever.”
However, not all members of the Mississippi delegation are in favor of the policy. U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the lone Democrat from the Mississippi delegation who represents the Delta, said in an August news release that deploying the Guard was a “power grab” by Trump, “trying to crown himself king.”
“Washington, D.C., needed the National Guard deployed on Jan. 6th, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, but he did nothing,” Thompson said. “Now, Donald Trump has chosen to unleash federal power against a community that didn’t vote for him, proving once again that his priorities are political vengeance and self-promotion.”
While the congressional debate in Congress continues over the policy, the courts are also weighing in. 
A federal judge in California ruled earlier this month that the Trump administration broke the law by deploying National Guard troops in Los Angeles during the summer. The Trump administration is appealing the ruling.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/18111710/AP25244526227762.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

WILMINGTON—ChristianaCare has become the first health system in Delaware to offer two new FDA-approved, minimally invasive procedures for patients with tricuspid valve disease.
These groundbreaking treatments, TriClip and EVOQUE, can repair or replace a failing tricuspid valve without open-heart surgery, giving patients a safer option and faster recovery.
New options for tricuspid valve regurgitation
The tricuspid valve directs blood flow through the heart, but when it fails to close properly, blood leaks backward — a condition known as tricuspid valve regurgitation. This forces the heart to work harder, often leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling.
“ChristianaCare continues to innovate in the area of non-surgical valve procedures,” said Kirk Garratt, M.D., MSc, medical director of the Center for Heart & Vascular Health. “We now offer every FDA-approved therapy for tricuspid valve disease, which means we can tailor treatment to each patient and choose the option that best fits their condition.”

The new treatments are:

TriClip: A clip attaches to valve flaps that don’t close properly, stopping leaks.
EVOQUE: A replacement valve that uses the patient’s own valve as an anchor to take over function.

“Most of our patients with tricuspid valve disease are older adults, and they really do not desire to travel to Philadelphia for treatment,” said Erin Fender, M.D., interventional cardiologist. “ChristianaCare’s tricuspid valve disease program enables patients to stay in Delaware for treatment and receive this leading-edge care.”
Fender and James Hopkins, M.D., performed ChristianaCare’s first TriClip procedure in August and its first EVOQUE procedure in September.
Both procedures are performed by threading a catheter through a vein in the leg to reach the heart. Guided by echocardiogram, the operation typically lasts one to two hours.
“Patients are usually up and walking later that evening or the next morning, depending on what time of day the procedure was done,” Fender said. “They’re typically discharged the following day.”

In the past, open-heart surgery was the only treatment option, but many patients with severe symptoms weren’t strong candidates.
“When I was a fellow, I did research focused on tricuspid regurgitation at a time when patients really had no therapeutic options,” Fender said. “Now, being able to offer people therapy that’s so safe and effective, with minimal downtime afterwards, is absolutely transformative to our patients. It’s delightful to see the evolution.”

So why do we elect people who are essentially regional correctional commissioners, with voters often having little basis to evaluate whether they're doing a good job or not?","FOR A GUY who holds a fairly obscure elected county office, one that voters have little to no contact with – if they are lucky – Steve Tompkins managed to make himself a remarkably visible player on the political scene. He threw in early with Elizabeth Warren in 2012 as she ran for US Senate and spoke eight years later at her presidential campaign kickoff in 2020. He’s been a prominent ally of Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s, and once made a run at chairing the Massachusetts Democratic Party.  
While Tompkins has adeptly leveraged his office to forge a deep well of political connections, his resume for the job itself was remarkably thin when Gov. Deval Patrick named him Suffolk County sheriff in 2013 after tapping then-Sheriff Andrea Cabral to serve as his public safety secretary. Tompkins had served as communications chief to Cabral, a college classmate from Boston College, but had no formal background in corrections or law enforcement.  
When Patrick was questioned at the time about the appointment, he said the quiet part out loud about Massachusetts sheriffs, who have responsibility for managing complex county correctional facilities but get the job by political fundraising, campaigning, and winning elections to six-year terms. “It’s a political job, so the folks that are criticizing it as a political hire, tell them: They’re right,” Patrick said after swearing in Tompkins.  
While he may earn points for candor, Patrick’s “political hire” to fill the sheriff’s seat until the next election does not, in hindsight, look like one of his finer personnel picks in the wake of Tompkins’s indictment last month on federal corruption charges.  
Tompkins, who has handily won three election campaigns since his appointment, is charged with extortion involving a cannabis company whose stock he’s alleged to have pressured the firm to sell to him before the business went public. The indictment alleges that he later demanded to be repaid his initial investment, despite the value of the stock falling below his purchase price. The company had a partnership with the sheriff’s office to train released inmates for jobs in the cannabis industry, something key to its licensing under the state law requiring cannabis firms to invest in communities and individuals disproportionately affected by past sanctions against marijuana.  
Tompkins entered a not guilty plea to the charges. He has not commented, but his lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said following Tompkins’s arraignment, “The facts simply will demonstrate that he was charged with a crime he did not commit.”  
Tompkins’s use of the sheriff’s perch as a springboard to affable – and ambitious – player in Democratic politics highlights what Boston College political science professor David Hopkins calls the “odd and vestigial” practice of electing people who are essentially regional correctional commissioners, with voters often having little basis to evaluate whether they’re doing a good job or not.  
The office of sheriff itself is one of the oldest public positions in the Western hemisphere, referenced several times in the Magna Carta of 1215. Sheriffs served as tax collectors and carried out other duties for the British monarch. In the US, the position has become an elected one, with Massachusetts moving from gubernatorial appointment of sheriffs to electing them in 1855.  
While that nominally makes the office more accountable to the public, Mirya Holman, public policy professor at the University of Houston and co-author of a 2024 book on US sheriffs, says the reality often falls short of that ideal.  
“In order for elections to hold people accountable, you have to have competitive elections and voters have to be able to evaluate and compare candidates, which doesn’t happen a lot with sheriffs,” said Holman, who co-authored The Power of the Badge: Sheriffs and Inequality in the United States with Texas Christian University political scientist Emily Farris.  
That’s especially true in Massachusetts, where sheriffs are in charge of county jails and houses of correction but largely have no public patrol function as they do in other states. “It doesn’t seem like voters are deeply aware of what a sheriff does, especially in a place like Massachusetts, where the sheriff is in this hidden office,” said Holman.  
Instead, the sheriff’s post here has often been viewed as a cushy political sinecure, complete with a built-in campaign army of volunteers and donors thanks to corrections staff who are often eager to show loyalty to their boss.   
Tompkins’s focus on the political dimensions of the office was evident from the start, and not always in ways that comported with the law. He was fined $2,500 in 2015 by the State Ethics Commissions for flashing his official ID at store owners and asking them to remove signs for his election opponent in his first campaign to keep the job after his appointment. Two years ago, he was again sanctioned by the Ethics Commission, paying a $12,300 civil penalty for creating a paid position in the sheriff’s department for a niece who handled childcare for him during work hours and for also asking other subordinates to do personal errands.  
Other Massachusetts sheriffs have also not exactly covered themselves in glory lately. Earlier this week, the state campaign finance office said Norfolk County Sheriff Patrick McDermott has agreed to pay the state $36,300 from his personal and campaign funds to settle charges that he unlawfully used thousands of dollars in campaign funds to advance outside businesses he operates. Last September, Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi was arrested for operating under the influence outside the MGM casino in Springfield, where he had driven in a state-owned SUV.  
The election of sheriffs to run local correctional facilities stands in sharp contrast to the operation of state prisons by the Department of Correction, whose commissioner is appointed by the governor and must, under state law, have “at least five years of adult correctional administrative experience.”  
Putting state prisons under the oversight of an appointed official with corrections experience while leaving county facilities to be run by sheriffs who win what are often low-visibility elections is something “we don’t really square,” said Holman. “People who don’t have formal corrections or law enforcement background are in charge of running these facilities. That’s a huge problem in the United States.”  
Which is not to say that there aren’t plenty of sheriffs who bring relevant background to the position and pursue the job professionally and thoughtfully.  
Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian, a former legislator and prosecutor, has developed a raft of programs aimed at rehabilitation and successful reentry of inmates. In 2023, he was named national Sheriff of the Year by the Major County Sheriffs of America. Plymouth County Sheriff Joseph MacDonald is also a former prosecutor who has overseen innovative inmate programs during his 20-year tenure, the longest of any of the state’s current 14 sheriffs.  
“I am strongly in favor of having the sheriffs be elected,” said MacDonald, who also taught history and constitutional law and Quincy College prior to winning office in 2004. “If you’re looking for accountability, I think that is the best way. It’s not a perfect way but I think it is the best way. I have a level of faith in the electorate.”  
In the debate over whether sheriffs should be elected or, like the state Department of Correction commissioner, appointed based on their background, MacDonald acknowledged that there are “cogent arguments” on both sides.  
But there is unlikely to be much push for change.  
“Once these offices become elected, they often stay elected regardless of the argument for or value of that,” said Hopkins, the BC political science professor. “Whenever you’ve got these offices that are obscure enough that the average voter doesn’t really grasp what’s going on and figuring out who should hold them is a real challenge, you can make a case that it should not be an elected office. But it’s always a hard sell to tell voters why we should take away their right to choose someone.”  
As for the string of recent events casting sheriffs in a harsh light, though emphasizing that “everyone is cloaked in a presumption of innocence,” MacDonald said, “when these things happen, it damages all of us.

(Photo by Michael Theberge/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)A new comparative analysis of states’ religiousness published this week by the Pew Research Center shows Alaska is the 35th most religious state in the country. 
The survey found 26% of Alaskans in Pew’s Religious Landscape Study are considered “highly religious,” based on questions asking whether they believe in God, pray regularly, attend religious services, and consider religion to be important.
The survey, perhaps the highest-quality long-term study of religion in the United States, was conducted in 2023 and 2024, with initial results published in February; Pew released a state-by-state comparison this week.
Chip Rotolo was the main author of the new state-level data analysis. By phone on Wednesday, he said that 40% of Alaskans now say they seldom or never pray.
“That’s up 10 points from 2014 (the most recent prior Pew study). That’s statistically significant. The share of those who say religion is not too important or not at all important, it’s 43%. That’s up 13 points from 10 years ago, so also significant.”
Mississippi was considered the No. 1 most-religious state, with Vermont finishing 51st, last among the states and the District of Columbia.
Among states that voted for Donald Trump in 2024, only Iowa (tied for 43rd) and Nevada (tied for 46th) were less religious than Alaska. 
Alaska was the most religious state bordering the Pacific Ocean. Washington (tied for 37th), Oregon (tied for 46th), California (39rd) and Hawaii (tied for 43rd) are all less religious than Alaska.
Pew previously conducted the Religious Landscape Study in 2014 and 2007, and the results show a downward trend in religiousness within Alaska. In the latest survey, 33% of Alaskans identified as religiously unaffiliated, while 56% said they identified as Christian. In 2014, 62% of respondents identified as Christian and 31% identified as religiously unaffiliated.
Two percent of Alaskans identified as “Pagan or Wiccan,” with 1% identifying as Jewish and 1% identifying as Buddhist, the largest non-Christian religious groups. 
Fifteen percent of respondents identified as Catholic, and 26% as some type of evangelical Protestant.
Nationally, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has dropped since 2007, but the decline leveled off starting in 2020, according to Pew data. In the latest survey, 62% of Americans said they identify as Christian, and 29% identified as unaffiliated.
“Generally,” Rotolo said, “what we see in Alaska parallels very closely what we see at the national level.”
Spirituality — the belief in a soul or spirit — hasn’t declined as much. Eighty-six percent of Alaskans said they believe in a soul. Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas and Virginia, among other states, reported the same level of belief. 
“I think in general, Alaska falls in a pretty similar space on the spiritual measures that it does on the religion (measures), which is … if you broke the United States into thirds, two-thirds would be more spiritual and one-third would be less spiritual,” Rotolo said.
Limited public polling is available on religion in the United States. The U.S. Census Bureau is legally forbidden from asking about religion during the once-per-decade Census and doesn’t regularly ask religion-related questions during the surveys it conducts between Censuses.
The Public Religion Research Institute conducts annual religious censuses down to the county level, but its sample size is smaller than the Pew study and thus has a larger margin of error.
In 2024, its survey — based on just 51 people in Alaska — estimated that 26% of the state had no religious affiliation, below its national average of 28%. 
Its 2023 survey estimated that Anchorage had one of the highest proportions of non-Christian residents anywhere in the country.
Several public opinion survey companies active in Alaska said they don’t typically ask about religion. Data for Progress said it asked about religion in a spring 2024 survey; of 1,120 respondents, 29% said they were not religious and another 12% said “none of the above.” Fifty-two percent of respondents identified themselves as some kind of Christian.
Ivan Moore, who operates Anchorage-based Alaska Survey Research, said he did include questions about religion in a survey conducted this summer.
That survey found 41 percent of respondents identified themselves as atheist, agnostic, or “nothing in particular.” Forty-three percent of respondents said they do not consider themselves actively religious. Approximately one-third of Alaska adults selected a religious affiliation and said they were actively religious, Moore said.
Looking ahead, Rotolo said, he’s interested to know whether there is indeed a revival of religiousness among younger Americans.
“Most of our demographic data suggests we will see more religious decline,” he said, but since the COVID pandemic, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has stabilized.
“That stability story right now is still really interesting,” he said.
Rotolo also noted that historically, “women have been quite a lot more religious than men on all of those core measures we tend to look at.”
That’s begun to change.
“Among young men and women, those born in the 2000s, those born in the 1990s, the gap between men and women is almost gone, and on some measures, is gone,” he said, in large part because large numbers of young women are leaving religion.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5124130002_55c065197b_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 10:57:58.666496

As a first-generation college student from a working-class Vermont family, Evan Haley knew college was out of reach without support. Brittany Hamblin was working hard and still falling behind. The Curtis Fund changed that with scholarships to support the education that would set them on a path to success.

In Vermont and across the country, higher education is slipping further out of reach for working-class students. Soaring tuition, shrinking aid, and political attacks on public education are pushing postsecondary education out of reach for many. The Curtis Fund stands in sharp contrast. They don’t just make education accessible; they make it real by providing scholarships for two- and four-year degree programs and short-term, career focused training programs. 

For Evan Haley, The Curtis Fund was the catalyst behind a career built on giving back. A first-generation college student from a working-class Vermont family, Evan knew postsecondary education wasn’t something he could pursue on hope alone. It had to be mapped out, paid for, and within reach. “Unless higher education was a sure thing and a positive return, I could’ve ended up doing something completely different,” he said. “The Curtis Fund made it possible.”


 “I ended up in higher ed because I wanted to help students who were like me,” Evan says.

The opportunity became a launchpad. Evan completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Vermont, graduating without taking on debt thanks to his scholarship, and then earned a master’s in education. Today, he’s giving back to his community, working as Assistant Director for Student Conduct at the University of Vermont, educational and social lead for the university staff union, and a doctoral student in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies.
His decision to stay in-state and serve his community was intentional. “I ended up in higher ed because I wanted to help students who were like me,” Evan says. “That’s why I do what I do.”
But Evan’s story isn’t just about personal achievement. He sees education and access to it as a political act. “There’s a real movement to eliminate or reduce access to higher education. Programs like The Curtis Fund are how we fight back. They keep students enrolled with their renewable scholarships. They keep institutions alive. And they keep the future of change within reach.”
That’s what drives him. “I want to be on every front that matters,” he says. “Now’s not the time to sit back and hope things work out. It’s the time to try everything.”
From union halls to university offices, Evan is shaping systems from both the inside and the outside. And it all started with The Curtis Fund giving him the keys to unlock the gate and the footing to walk through it.
Thanks to wrap-around support and automatically renewable scholarships, Curtis Fund scholars graduate at a significantly higher-than-average rate of almost 90%. “When you support The Curtis Fund, you’re not just backing one student’s degree. You’re fueling a future of impact, leadership, and service to Vermont communities”.
Brittany Hamblin
Brittany Hamblin was doing everything right and still falling behind, but her life changed when she received a Credentials of Value (COV) scholarship from The Curtis Fund. For twelve years, she worked a demanding retail job that left no room to breathe. Her health, her energy, and her sense of self were all on the back burner. Her job gave her a title and a paycheck, though it meant long shifts, missed moments, and a growing sense that something had to change. 

“I felt trapped before. I wouldn’t have been brave enough to make the leap without The Curtis Fund scholarship,” Brittany says.

That’s when Brittany found Stafford Technical Center’s adult education program. The idea of going back to school had always felt out of reach. “I never had loans, but I was afraid of having them,” she said. “It felt like taking out another mortgage, like another weight we couldn’t carry.”
Then, a VSAC counselor awarded Brittany with a Credentials of Value scholarship and cleared the financial barrier that had always stopped her. It gave her a path forward that didn’t require her to sacrifice her family’s stability to build something better. It also allowed her to complete her training without going into debt—something she hadn’t believed was possible.
Brittany enrolled in Stafford’s aesthetics program and started over. Today, she works at Five Elements Salon and Day Spa in Rutland as a licensed esthetician, massage therapist, and assistant manager. She treats clients, manages the front desk, and still gets home in time to tuck her kids in. 
“I felt trapped before. I wouldn’t have been brave enough to make the leap without The Curtis Fund scholarship,” Brittany says. “Now, I’m learning and evolving in a way that lets me care for others and still show up for my family.”
She’s continuing her education, expanding her certifications, and helping the spa grow to meet community needs. “A lot of our clients carry so much. I get to help them feel better—in their skin, in their bodies, in their day. Self-care isn’t always about indulgence. For many of our clients, it’s one of the few moments they get to feel at ease. And I get to be part of that.”

“We were freaking out,” said Stone Child College President Cory Sangrey-Billy.
Montana has seven tribal colleges out of the 35 in the country — the most of any state.
The schools together are estimated to receive $108 million, or roughly double last year’s allocation, said Sangrey-Billy.
“It’s quite a significant jump,” she said.
Now, budget planning is underway at Stone Child in Box Elder and other tribal colleges in Montana.
And tribal education leaders in Montana are touting the results of an economic impact study that shows the federal investment pays dividends to taxpayers.
The report, from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, said tribal colleges in Montana added $332.2 million in income to the economy in the 2022-2023 fiscal year.
“There is a value to what we bring to the table,” Sangrey-Billy said. “And that’s where we’ve been very successful.”
Based in Alexandria, Virginia, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium has a mission to amplify the voices of tribal-led colleges and universities.
A message on its website said it applauds the Trump administration’s increased investment in Tribal Colleges and Universities.
“This one-time allocation by the federal government for Fiscal Year 2025 is progress towards fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations as intended and a welcome new precedent in increased investment into TCUs,” the consortium said.
The consortium also said some of the increase comes from dollars that were cut from other federal programs supporting Native American and Alaska Native students at non-tribal colleges.
It encouraged a federal commitment to support all Native students “wherever they pursue post-secondary learning.”

Montana Tribal Colleges and Universities consist of Aaniiih Nakata College on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation; Blackfeet Community College; Chief Dull Knife College on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation; Fort Peck Community College; Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation; Stone Child College on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation; and Salish Kootenai College on the Flathead Indian Reservation. 

Stone Child does not have the funds in hand yet and is also waiting to see the constraints on spending, Sangrey-Billy said.
She said the money could be allocated for infrastructure, for example — and Stone Child is in need of a new roof. It also could be designated for assessment and education, she said — such as to support student retention by paying for tutors and mentors.
Either way, she said, college leaders are thrilled with the additional money — and pleased to report the return on investment to the community.
The economic impact report, “Building Local Economies of Scale,” measures both the economic impact of tribal colleges in Montana and their returns on investment to students, taxpayers and society.
One of the impacts that resonated with Sangrey-Billy included payroll of $47.1 million — “much of which was spent in the state on groceries, mortgage and rent payments, dining out, and other household expenses,” the report said.
Sangrey-Billy said shopping options are limited near the college on the Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation with 213 enrolled.
“We can only get a few groceries out there so we have to go to Havre (or Great Falls). The economic impact that we have there is big,” she said.
The report also said TCUs generate more in national tax revenue than they receive. It said for every $1 of public money invested in Montana’s tribal colleges, national taxpayers receive $1.40 over the course of a student’s life, and state taxpayers receive $12.40.
It estimated the social benefits to society at $500.8 million through a mix of added student income of $337.1 million, added business income of $135.6 million, and avoided costs of $28.11 million.
Brad Hall, president of Blackfeet Community College in Browning, said tribal colleges are “a good investment,” but changes in the White House can mean changes in objectives.
He said that means tribal college leaders need to educate new administrations about their value. He just returned from Washington, D.C., where he met with federal leaders in education and found them receptive.
“Now that we’re getting to the table and talking more, there’s a willingness to hear what we absolutely need,” Hall said. “A lot of the people we’re working with have never really worked with tribal colleges or were aware of that.”
One issue that’s caused confusion, he said, is that tribal colleges are not DEI programs — the Trump administration has moved to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Hall said the colleges are tribally chartered campuses in which the federal government has a fiduciary and trust responsibility to help maintain.
“The advocacy just takes time, but I can tell you with certainty we do have our baseline funding, and it’s just that this year was harder to budget for because we didn’t have the certainty that we normally have in budget cycles,” Hall said.
He too pointed to the results of the economic impact study from the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, conducted in partnership with Lightcast. The report said Lightcast provides colleges and universities with labor market data to help create better outcomes for students, businesses and communities.
In Montana, tribal college alumni generated $258.6 million in added income for the state in the 2022-2023 fiscal year, or the equivalent of 4,017 jobs, for instance, the report said.
“We’re not institutions that just take,” Hall said. “We’re institutions that are absolutely vital and contributing to the communities that we serve.”

Nearly 28% of Michigan students were chronically absent during the 2024-25 school year, the third consecutive year the rate has dropped.
But the rate is still significantly higher than it was before the pandemic began, when 19.7% of students were chronically absent during the 2018-19 school year, according to data released Wednesday by the state Center for Educational Performance and Information.
Chronic absence, which impedes students’ ability to learn and creates instability in the classroom, is a concern in a state where academic performance has been lackluster.
“It’s important for communities to continue to collaborate to emphasize the importance of good attendance and assist children most in need of attendance support,” State Superintendent Michael Rice said in a statement Wednesday.
Students are considered chronically absent in Michigan if they miss 10% of the school year, or roughly 18 or more days in a typical 180-day year.
Michigan had one of the highest rates of chronic absenteeism in the nation at the height of the pandemic, when the rate was 38.5% during the 2021-22 school year. The rate dropped to 30.8% in 2022-23 and 29.5% in 2023-24.
The state’s progress last year was similar to the previous two years, said Jeremy Singer, assistant professor of educational leadership and policy at the University of Michigan-Flint.
Singer, who has conducted extensive research on attendance via Wayne State University’s Detroit Partnership for Education Equity and Research, or Detroit PEER, said that progress still is slower than “we want to see on average.”
“But obviously it’s a good thing to see things moving in the right direction.”



A Chalkbeat analysis of the data found:

263 district and charter schools had chronic absenteeism rates above 36%, which Singer considers “very high.” The average rate among those districts and charters was 51%.
The highest rate of chronic absenteeism, nearly 93%, belongs to Blended Learning Academies Credit Recovery High School, a charter school, which appears to have campuses in Lansing and Livonia..
Nearly half of Black students statewide were chronically absent during the 2024-25 school year, compared to 34% of Hispanic students, 34% of Native American students, 20% of Asian American students, and 21% of white students. The rate for Black students is above the pre-pandemic level of 39% in 2018-19.




Despite the problem, more than half of the school leaders who responded to a statewide survey by researchers at Detroit PEER said they haven’t received any guidance from their districts on how to improve students’ attendance.
Even among those who did receive guidance, just 13% said the guidance was very helpful, Singer said.
“That might be because the guidance is unclear, or maybe it’s because they feel like what is being recommended isn’t working as well as they were hoping.”
Still, simply providing stronger guidance won’t solve the problem, because schools alone can’t solve chronic absenteeism, something Singer and research partner Sarah Winchell Lenhoff, the Detroit PEER director, made clear in a book they released earlier this year.
“I do think clear guidance can help, especially if it helps schools be thoughtful about what strategies they prioritize and how they allocate their resources,” he said..
Detroit PEER sent surveys to around 2,700 school leaders across Michigan. About 41%, or 1,143, replied, giving the researchers a broad look at how schools in the state are addressing chronic absenteeism. The research is ongoing, but initial findings were recently released.
Districts serving impoverished communities have more to overcome
A lack of accessible transportation, parents’ inflexible work schedules, health concerns, and unsafe routes to school have long contributed to high levels of chronic absenteeism in impoverished communities.
The negative effects of the pandemic, which disproportionately hit low-income households, exacerbated existing systemic inequities.
Michigan’s recently released data, however, shows many of the districts with the most to overcome outpaced the rest of the state in improving attendance – like the Detroit school district.
Before the pandemic, the Detroit Public Schools Community District, where 84% of students come from low-income homes, made progress reducing absenteeism with wraparound services for families, hiring attendance agents, and community partnerships.
That momentum was lost in the 2021-22 school year, when the rate of chronic absenteeism shot up to 76.7% in the school system largely due to quarantine rules at the time.
Last year, for the first time, students in the district were chronically absent at a lower rate than in the years preceding the pandemic, the state’s new data shows.
In 2024-25, 60.9% of students in the district missed 10 or more days of school. The rate was 1.2 percentage points lower compared to the 2018-19 school year – the last year before COVID upended in-person instruction.
“Our improvement is rooted in our intentional efforts to expand services to students and families, changing staff mindsets about owning the student attendance improvement process, and increasing family accountability regarding their children’s attendance,” Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told Chalkbeat in an email.
The school system has used a multilayered approach to improve attendance in the years since then , including connecting directly with families to help meet their needs, fostering more partnerships, financial incentives for students, and installing laundry machines at schools, among others.
In the Lansing Public School District, where more than 87% of students are from low-income homes, the absenteeism rate is also now lower than it was before the pandemic. The percentage of kids missing too much school has dramatically decreased from high rates in the early days of COVID.
In the 2021-22 school year, more than 90% of students in the district were chronically absent. Last year, the rate decreased by nearly 38 percentage points.
The district uses a tiered system of support for kids who are at risk of missing too much school with classroom, school, and district-level strategies. The system ranges from informing families on how they can ask for help managing barriers to creating attendance success plans.
Classroom teachers reward students who improve their attendance. At the school level, families of students who are missing three to four days of school a month may get wake-up robo calls as a “friendly nudge.” At the district level, administrators follow-up on referrals to the Office of School Culture’s Attendance Team to set up parent and student meetings.
“We are so proud of our students, families, and educators, who have focused deeply on making every day count and having as many of our students show up to learn,” Benjamin Shuldiner, superintendent of the district, told Chalkbeat in an email.
Some districts improve attendance with mental health supports, accountability
James E. Anderson, superintendent of Wyandotte Public Schools, told Chalkbeat mental health concerns have been the cause of many instances of chronic absenteeism since the pandemic.
“More and more students are having anxiety about something at school,” he said. “It may be peer-to-peer interaction or not wanting to get back into the habit of going to school everyday.”
That aligns with what researchers have learned from the Detroit PEER survey. Researchers provided a list of 33 potential barriers and asked the school leaders to select the top five most common. The survey responses found 43% of school leaders selected mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, as a top barrier.
Chronic absenteeism in the suburban school district jumped to 45.7% in the 2021-22 school year – more than 20 percentage points higher compared to the years before COVID. Last school year, the rate stabilized at 27.8%.
Anderson said the district addresses absenteeism with a simple system.
When students are absent five times, they receive a letter breaking down how many days of school they will miss by the end of the year if they continue missing days at their current rate.
By 10 absences, administrators ask for a meeting with the students’ family to determine what challenges they are facing. The district connects the students with resources based on their needs, such as school or community-based mental health services or arranging transportation, like carpools with neighbors.
At 15 absences, a ticket is issued via a local ordinance. Families must then appear in court to explain why students aren’t getting to school. In some cases, fees are issued.
Statewide survey show schools taking similar approaches
Initial findings from the Detroit PEER research indicate that there is little differentiation between schools in how they’re addressing chronic absenteeism.
“Schools are looking at and are approaching the issue relatively similarly,” Singer said.
Singer said he isn’t sure yet whether that’s a good or a bad thing.
“It worries me a little bit because I think what it communicates is that schools are still trying to figure out how to solve it and so they’re doing a lot of everything.”
The report noted that “the most common practices centered on communication, social-emotional learning, and mental health support” but that “resource-intensive practices like home visits or arranging transportation were less common.”
The least common practices, Singer said, are strategies related to improving conditions within schools so that students have a more positive experience.
“That’s something that’s within the school’s control,” Singer said.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two tax credit program audits were met with skepticism from the Legislative Post Audit committee Tuesday, one because it lacked data about usage and the other about concerns the state will lose as much as $1 billion in income tax in the coming years.
The committee heard presentations about two tax credit programs, the High Performance Incentive Program, or HPIP, and the Kansas Affordable Housing Tax Credit, or KAHTC.
Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, asked for limited-scope audits of both programs, seeking an answer to the total dollar amount of tax credits awarded and how much businesses had used them in the past five years.
 
HPIP uncertainty
The HPIP program uses state income tax credits to encourage businesses to make capital investments, said Josh Luthi, principal auditor for the Legislative Post Audit division.
Luthi reported that data challenges prevented the auditors from tracking the amount of tax credits earned and used. He said three different data sets provided to auditors by the Kansas Department of Revenue were “inconsistent” and varied by millions of dollars.
“For example, for tax year 2019, one data set showed businesses earned about $900 million in HPIP credits credits and used about $90 million,” Luthi said. “The second data set showed businesses earned about $230 million in credits and used about $110 million, and the third data set showed businesses earned about $160 million and used about $100 million.”
Kathleen Smith, with the Kansas Department of Revenue, explained why there were three data sets, one of which included duplication of numbers. She said the revenue department believes the third data set is accurate but has an employee dedicated to going through each file to verify all information is accurate.
They expect to have accurate numbers by January 2026, Smith said.
The data is difficult to track because tax credits may be passed through to shareholders of the company who then claim the credits on their tax returns, or the owner of an LLC may use the tax credits, Luthi said. That requires revenue employees to manually process tax data.
“We do not know how much (earned tax credit) is out there that hasn’t been used,” Luthi said.
In addition to the challenge of transferred credits, Smith noted that the tax credits can be used over 16 years.
The inability to determine how much tax credit was unused concerned legislators.
“This is critical,” Tyson said. “That’s part of the reason I requested the audit is because we really don’t know what we’re handing out on one hand, what the state’s obligated for.”
Smith said she had numbers for 2023 that indicate $154.7 million in tax credits were claimed, and of that, $115.1 million in total credit was allowed.
 
Affordable housing tax credits
The affordable housing program offers tax credits for building units that are rented at specific percentages below market prices in the areas they are built. The developments must remain affordable for 30 years.
The tax credits can be used annually for 10 years, and Luthi submitted a chart that showed how the credits offered each year aggregate over time. For instance, in calendar year 2023, $25.3 million in tax credits would continue through 2033.
Added to that number in 2024 was $30.6 million in tax credits, which would continue through 2034. In 2031 through 2035, Luthi’s chart showed that available tax credits would be $107 million per year.
Luthi’s chart showed that over about 14 years, the program would offer tax credits of just over $1 billion.
Since 2023, $73 million in KAHTC tax credits have been awarded for 67 projects statewide, Luthi said.
Ryan Vincent, executive director of the Kansas Housing Resources Corp., which manages KAHTC, said the program has done what was intended by significantly increasing the number of affordable housing developments statewide.
The state credits combine with federal credits, he said. In 2022, before KAHTC, the federal tax credit funded 491 homes in Kansas. Since then the two tax credit programs have funded 2,123 homes in 2023; 2,435 in 2024; and through August of this year, 1,184 homes, Vincent said.
“Just the development budget of the homes that are already built through this program equals $1.5 billion – with a ‘b’ – across Kansas,” Vincent said. “We don’t give the credits until the housing’s built. Without these credits, the homes wouldn’t have been built without the dollars. Without the credits, the dollars wouldn’t have been spent in your respective communities. These programs generate, or these properties generate, short-term economic development and tax revenues immediately.”
Vincent told legislators that changes last session capped the KAHTC program at $8.8 million of tax credits per year, much less than the $25 million to $30 million awarded in 2023 that 2024. The changes also said the state couldn’t use the $8.8 million to participate in a federal program that used private activity bonds, he said.
Because of those changes, Vincent said development probably wouldn’t continue at the same pace that it has in the last couple of years.
Tyson said she had heard negative feedback from constituents about the program, pointing to a person who told her a house built with tax money was sitting empty and wasn’t needed in their community.
Vincent said housing market studies are done to make sure housing is needed in any area before developments are approved and also said developers wouldn’t invest their dollars in rental properties that they didn’t believe could be rented.
Tyson and other legislators raised concerns about the overall cost of the program.
“We’re talking a billion-dollar giveaway,” Tyson said. “And so what that does is ties our hands for future programs and ties our hands for moving forward with the budget and expenditures. I just would like to keep that in mind. I know you keep saying how wonderful it would be to have the cap removed. You haven’t convinced me yet.”
Vincent disagreed with the term “giveaway.”
“I know how much compliance and how much investment and how much work it is for all the parties. Ultimately, I go to those ribbon cuttings. I walk through those developments,” he said. “I have the conversations with the clerk at the Holiday Inn that used to have to drive two hours into Colby because they weren’t able to find a decent, safe, affordable home. Home matters and home pays big dividends, so I ask that you as policymakers remember that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1010246-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-19 09:57:10.133333

Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin during the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. McCarthy stands before a map which charts what he said was Communist activity in the United States. (Photo by Getty Images)Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.”
I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment.
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower.
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word.
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling.
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue.
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”
The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction. This is a very, very difficult one of those cycles. But I’ve been an optimist my whole life. It’s being challenged like never before in my life. My father endured it and came out an optimist anyway, somehow. So to honor my father, I maintain my optimism.”

Instead of a widespread national dialogue on — and spirited defense of — every American’s right to voice their opinion on the complex issues facing the nation, repression and retribution have been leveled against those who didn’t happen to agree with Kirk’s positions.
It’s not something to be taken lightly when “the powers that be” get to decide what words or opinions you get to state or hold.  After all, if there’s one thing everybody has a right to, it’s their own opinion.
Yet, apparently that right ends when and if someone, somewhere, for whatever reason decides to voice their opinion about Kirk and his opinions — which he often encouraged others to challenge with his “prove me wrong” approach to taking questions from attendees at his frequent speaking engagements.
Most of the radical reactions to anyone disagreeing with Kirk’s positions have been targeted at a largely mythical entity called “the left” — as if the only two positions citizens may have in this increasingly divided nation are “the right” or “the left.”
Nothing could be further from the truth.  For most people politics is not the center of their universe, not even close.  In fact, recent polls show most Americans don’t particularly like Republicans or Democrats very much — nor the president, with his approval ratings deeply underwater and nearly two-thirds disapproving of the direction in which his increasingly radical dictates are taking the nation.
Most people — and certainly most Montanans — have lives to lead, jobs to do, families to raise and care for, and bills to pay to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.  The last thing they’re particularly interested in is wading into the stinking muck of partisan politics, or hating their neighbor because they have differing political opinions.
Yet, every day another story comes out about the firing of more commentators, news reporters, and even comedians who practice the time-honored tradition of making fun of politicians — a rich field to be plowed indeed!
While the vast majority of the free speech retribution has been coming from Republicans over who says what about Kirk, apparently the “you can’t say that” crushing of our First Amendment Right to Free Speech has now been adopted by the Democratic Party in the Big Sky State.
Just this week, following the Democratic Party’s convention, the newly-elected vice chair, Max Johansen, was forced to resign for — of all things — saying something the party poobahs didn’t like about former Montana U.S. Senator Jon Tester.
And what could have been so horrible that Johansen resigned only three days after being duly elected at the convention?  Well, he voiced his opinion that: “I think a lot of people are upset with Tester for not being more proactive and forthright” in his campaign against Tim Sheehy, who beat Tester convincingly.  He also voiced his opinion that Democrats should “stop running away” from the word socialism when it’s “direct aid” helping vulnerable groups.
Apparently Republicans aren’t the only ones censoring opinions they don’t want to hear … or crushing our First Amendment right to Free Speech.
The Democrats could have used the Johansen episode to uphold the value of diverse opinions and the right to voice them in the democracy they repeatedly tell us is so perilously at stake.  They could have said the Democrats are a “big tent” of opinions.  But no, they did just the opposite and condemned Johansen — thus despicably joining the Trumpers in crushing our dwindling right to Free Speech.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/First_Amendment_to_the_U.S._Constitution-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-19 09:57:10.133333

Rural hospitals across the state — and country — are in trouble, urgently. Labor and supplies are getting more expensive. Federal Medicaid cuts are projected to cut into their revenues. 
And places like Inyo County, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, face the prospect of having to close key medical facilities.
Southern Inyo Healthcare District, one of two hospitals in the county, had eight days of cash on hand as of Sept.12, the hospital’s chief executive told our Kristen Hwang. Hospitals usually have more than 200 days of cash on hand. 
Local officials have sent a letter requesting an emergency $3 million from Gov. Gavin Newsom to stabilize the facility.

The letter says: “If doors close, thousands of elderly and rural Californians will be left without access to critical healthcare, creating a true medical desert in another region of the state.” 

Here’s Kristen: 
Located in Lone Pine, a town at the base of Mt. Whitney with just 1,300 residents, Southern Inyo Healthcare District is the only hospital within a nearly 60-mile radius. It’s the closest stop for injured hikers and dehydrated tourists visiting Whitney or nearby Death Valley, which regularly receives over 1 million visitors per year. Without it there would be a 136-mile stretch between the next closest hospitals in the eastern Sierra Nevada.
The only hospital in Northern California’s Glenn County said three weeks ago that it would shut down by October.

The obscure court that will now rule on billions of dollars in federal research grants

The Trump administration has eliminated billions of dollars in science grants to universities. 
If the universities want to try to get their research funds back, the Supreme Court says they have to go to an obscure court to do so. Our higher education reporter, Mikhail Zinshteyn, takes a look at that court. 
He writes that the modern Court of Federal Claims, in existence since before the Civil War, was created by the Tucker Act and is the venue for contract disputes with the federal government. For example: a company hired to build a bridge would Uncle Sam if it hadn’t gotten paid. 

David Marcus, UCLA law professor: “I had never spent more than three minutes in class even mentioning the existence of the Tucker Act, and it would never have occurred to me to do so before this spring.”

The Court of Federal Claims was a little-known court until the U.S. Supreme Court said that universities need to file suit there, and not in traditional district courts, to try to have their research grant funding restored. The Trump administration has terminated billions of dollars in science grants.


Following a  complicated Supreme Court ruling in late August, the fate of billions of dollars of science research grants is now at the mercy of an obscure federal law known as the Tucker Act.  
“I had never spent more than three minutes in class even mentioning the existence of the Tucker Act, and it would never have occurred to me to do so before this spring,” said David Marcus, a UCLA professor of law who specializes in civil procedure and federal courts. 
The Tucker Act created the modern version of the Court of Federal Claims, in existence since before the Civil War. Until recently it was the venue for contract disputes with the federal government — think: a company hired to build a bridge sues Uncle Sam over missed pay.
But starting with a surprise, terse order in April followed by a zigzagging set of decisions last month that are stumping lawyers, the Supreme Court basically declared that this little-known court is now the venue for any university or state that wants to dispute the Trump administration’s cancellation of research grants.
The Supreme Court’s April ruling stated that grant disputes should be hashed out in the Court of Federal Claims. The ruling came in a case in which California and other states sought to recover tens of millions of dollars in education funding.Then came the high court’s fractured August ruling, which saw two slim majority rulings in the same case. One was a 5-4 decision siding with Trump that said grant funding has to be settled at the Court of Federal Claims rather than in a traditional district court. The decision could help the Trump administration because it likely requires plaintiffs to seek the restoration of their funding in the Court of Federal Claims and then challenge the legality of the policy behind the grant cancellations in a district court — in effect extra work for researchers and campuses seeking their funding back.But the other 5-4 decision benefitted research universities by indicating that the new federal rules prompting the grant cuts were probably illegal, partially upholding a lower court judge’s order. The case will now proceed in the lower courts.The ambiguity of the “tricky, complicated ruling,” as one legal scholar called it, prolongs the despair of thousands of researchers and graduate students whose life’s work — and a key source of staff income — either remains defunded or is now at risk of being once again terminated. 
Many of the grants were terminated because they ran afoul of Trump’s January executive orders banning so-called Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives.  
“It’s completely foreign to me” that the Court of Federal Claims is “now the place to handle these sort of basic, fundamental questions about the government’s power to handle appropriations,” Marcus said.
It’s not clear if existing grants that were cancelled and then reinstated, such as the hundreds at the National Institutes of Health, will again be defunded. The University of California is the recipient of hundreds of these health science grants. Nationally, the grants paid for research into life-saving drugs, dementia, heart disease in rural areas, robotics education and a whole gamut of science inquiries.
But even before the court’s August ruling, the UC was warning of major slowdowns to its research apparatus. The grant terminations and other funding cuts “have already disrupted the entire biotech research ecosystem at the University of California,” Theresa A. Maldonado, UC’s vice president for research and innovation, told a state legislative hearing in August. In 2024, California programs won more than $5 billion in grants from the NIH and over $1 billion from the National Science Foundation, she told lawmakers. More than 1,000 startups have been founded based on UC patents, she added.CalMatters reached out to the University of California and California Department of Justice about how they interpret the Supreme Court’s split decision and the role of the Court of Federal Claims. California’s attorney general is part of a multistate suit at the center of the Supreme Court’s August ruling. Both agencies are studying the implications of the ruling, spokespersons for each agency said. 
“Cuts to NIH funding risk derailing vital discoveries, disrupting research teams, and undermining economic growth in California and across the country,” UC spokesperson Stett Holbrook told CalMatters in an email. “We are closely assessing the ruling’s impact across UC’s campuses and health systems and will continue to press for full restoration of this essential federal support.”
How we got here
The Supreme Court’s split set of decisions was a response to a June lower court decision in Massachusetts. Judge William G. Young found that the federal government illegally terminated the grants, in large part because the grants weren’t reviewed individually but cancelled en masse. He also said the cancellations were racially motivated and ordered the funding restored. The August Supreme Court decision says that questions about restoring grant funding should go before the Court of Federal Claims.“There is no reasoned decision-making at all” about the NIH’s grant terminations,” Young wrote in his opinion expanding on his June decision. Instead, the cancellations were driven by “sparse pseudo-reasoning, and wholly unsupported statements,” he wrote.Young also faulted the Trump administration for having no definition for what constitutes DEI.Earlier this month Young apologized to the Supreme Court for seemingly misinterpreting its April order in which the justices for the first time said federal grants must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, The New York Times reported. Young indicated he was unclear on what the high court’s April and September orders meant for other district judges. “I simply did not understand that orders on the emergency docket were precedent,” he said. 
Other jurists said the Supreme Court’s use of the so-called “shadow docket” to issue rulings with little guidance or explanation is confusing. Because of the shadow docket decisions, lower court judges “must grapple with both existing precedent and interim guidance from the Supreme Court that appears to set that precedent aside without much explanation or consensus,” wrote one judge in a September opinion.The April decision commits one sentence to why the Court of Federal Claims is the right venue for government grant disputes. The five-judge majority in August in effect pointed to the April decision to support their ruling. 
Neither the April nor the August Supreme Court rulings “seriously engages with the scope of the Tucker Act and the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction,” Marcus said. “It’s just astonishing.”
Ten of the 21 judges on the Court of Federal Claims were appointed by President Donald Trump, and a majority were appointed by Republican presidents, giving the Trump administration a likely advantage. However, the appeals court overseeing the Court of Federal Claims contains a majority of judges appointed by Democrats. The U.S. Supreme Court can review decisions by the appeals court. 
At least $14 billion in grants affected by ruling
Parts of the Supreme Court decision “raise foundational questions” about grant termination lawsuits in federal district courts, Scott Delaney, a former environmental health research scientist at Harvard University, told CalMatters in an email.“That means that it’ll be much harder (and possibly impossible) to sue to reinstate all NIH and NSF grants that have been terminated, though scientists may still be able to win a court order forcing NIH or NSF to pay their universities the money that the government should have paid them under the grants,” he wrote.
Delaney co-founded Grant Witness, a tool that scours federal datasets to tally which grants the federal government under Trump has terminated or suspended.CalMatters asked him to count how many National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants that campuses across the country were fighting to reinstate are now affected by the Supreme Court ruling. The answer?

NIH: 4,044 grants worth $5.7 billion in unspent funds ($12.6 billion in total award value)
NSF: 1,954 grants worth $1 billion in unspent funds ($1.8 billion in estimated total award value)

Delaney said the Supreme Court ruling will likely affect billions of other dollars in grants from other agencies, such as NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, but Grant Witness isn’t tracking all those yet.
Why Court of Federal Claims may be a challenge for universities 
Marcus said there are probably four reasons universities want to avoid the Court of Federal Claims in their lawsuits  — and these are likely the same reasons why the Trump administration wants them there.
First, some district courts and appeals courts are more likely to include judges whose judicial leanings are more sympathetic to the states and research groups suing the Trump administration. That doesn’t mean just judges appointed by Democrats. Young, the district judge in the National Institutes of Health case, was appointed by Ronald Reagan.
Next, the Court of Federal Claims can award monetary damages, but it cannot make wider rulings, such as halting an agency from continued funding terminations. Those questions would have to go before a traditional district court, so it adds more work for plaintiffs suing the federal government.
Third, the Court of Federal Claims is more limiting in how it allows researchers to join a class action suit. Basically, researchers whose grants were affected by the terminations would have to opt-in by filing paperwork to receive potential financial relief or have their grants restored, Marcus said. That’s different from what occurs in traditional federal courts, where a judge can approve a set of criteria for who is eligible for a class, and then all those eligible people benefit from any decision that awards the class relief. 
But if a university sues, Marcus thinks the process is somewhat easier: The school would just file a complaint with a long list of all the grants or researchers covered in their suit. 
Fourth, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in her dissenting opinion for the Supreme Court noted other possible hardships. Requiring plaintiffs to argue before district courts that the rules terminating their grants are illegal and then separately getting their terminated grants reinstated is “sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief,” Jackson wrote.Justice Amy Coney Barrett disagreed in her majority 5-4 opinion. “Vacating the guidance does not reinstate terminated grants,” she wrote, adding that “two-track litigation” in different courts is common. She also addressed Jackson’s criticisms head-on, writing that both district courts and the Court of Federal Claims can separately adjudicate the relief universities or researchers seek.Barrett and Jackson were on the same side in the other 5-4 decision that said Trump’s policies to cut the grants were likely illegal. 
What’s next? 
Marcus cautions that the legal terrain around restoring grants remains an open question. 
But based on his reading of the Supreme Court cases, it is quite possible that the Court of Federal Claims is where scientists will have to try to force the restoration of any terminated funding. And the district court will continue to determine whether the policy behind the grant cuts is legal. It creates a scenario in which the Court of Federal Claims can order funding restored, but until a district court rules on the policy justifying the grant cuts, the federal government can continue to cancel other grants or deny new ones.But Marcus also cites at least one federal judge in California who thinks that individual researchers cannot sue in the Court of Federal Claims because they’re third parties to the contracts; the government technically sent the contracts to the university, not to the researchers. Under that scenario, it may be that individual researchers cannot sue to restore their grants at all and would instead need to rely on their employer to take up the legal fight.  
The equation for universities suing is also nuanced, Marcus said. If a university such as the UC sues to restore funding, there’s a possibility that a district court may rule that funding restoration would have to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. However, he noted that a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Trump administration to restore the $2.2 billion in grants it froze at Harvard University. That judge argued in part that the cuts violated the First Amendment rights of the university. So, even though the case is about money — presumably the domain of the Court of Federal Claims — issues of protected speech belong in a traditional district court.“The resolution of these claims might result in money changing hands, but what is fundamentally at issue is a bedrock constitutional principle rather than the interpretation of contract terms,” the judge, Allison D. Burroughs, wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021822_UCLA_RN_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Here’s why they’re divided,Adam Ashton and Jeremia Kimelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/calpers-election-spending/,"California unions are at odds and spending heavily in an election at CalPERS, the pension fund that provides retirement benefits to 2 million people.","In summary
California unions are at odds and spending heavily in an election at CalPERS, the pension fund that provides retirement benefits to 2 million people. 



California’s public employee unions often put up the big money — and the only money — in elections for seats on the board that oversees the state’s largest pension fund. 
This summer, they pulled together $660,000 through an independent expenditure committee to support their favored candidates at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System by sending mailers on their behalf.
But a different vein of money is pouring into the races, and it’s likely to make this the most-expensive CalPERS election ever.
The money is coming from a mix of mostly private sector construction and trade unions that have been urging the $584 billion pension fund to favor union shops in its real estate and construction investments. 
They’re backing incumbent Jose Luis Pacheco, who indicated during board meetings that he’s open to more restrictive labor agreements. Pacheco raised more money in direct contributions than any other CalPERS candidate in history, pulling in $184,000 with more than $54,000 of that coming from construction trade unions.
His is one two seats up for grabs, with voting scheduled to end Sept. 29. Pacheco is defending his seat against Troy Johnson, a challenger with backing from the major public sector unions; and Sam Hassan Akkad, a retired Caltrans engineer.
In the other race, incumbent David Miller, a longtime state government labor leader, is facing Santa Monica firefighter Dominick Bei and retired Pasadena City Manager Steve Mermell. 
“It’s amazing to see this kind of race drawing this kind of money from folks who aren’t part of the system,” said Miller, a two-term incumbent on the CalPERS board who previously was a union leader in the Professional Engineers in California Government and who has benefited from labor spending in his past campaigns. 
About 1.7 million civil servants and retirees are eligible to vote in the election. CalPERS is overseen by a 13-member board. Six are elected by members and seven are either elected officials or are appointed by the governor or Legislature.
Average taxpayers can’t vote, but what happens at CalPERS affects how much money schools, local government agencies and the state can spend on public services. CalPERS is considered underfunded because its assets are worth about 80% of what the system owes over time to its members. It beat its earnings target last year, but when it misses, it charges government agencies more money to make up the difference.
Overly rosy projections in the early 2000s led California to sweeten pensions for its government workers, but then the Great Recession hobbled the fund. It hasn’t clawed out from that one-two punch. 
“CalPERS hasn’t been managed well,”  said Mermell, the former city manager. “California is the 4th largest economy in the world so wouldn’t you think its public pension would be the envy of all the other states? But it’s not. It’s sort of in the middle of the pack.”

‘Money talks’ in pension board election
The dynamics of the race are more complicated than incumbents versus outsiders. 
Incumbent Miller and challenger Johnson are running as a slate. They’re getting a lift from the unions that sent out mailers stressing their bonafides as public sector labor leaders. Their independent expenditure committee was funded primarily by locals from Service Employees International Union and the California School Employees Association.
Incumbent Pacheco and challenger Bei are running on a competing slate, although Bei does not have the kind of direct contributions from trades unions that Pacheco received. They have support from public safety unions as well as watchdog retiree organizations that have been critical of CalPERS’ investment strategies.

Both coalitions — the SEIU-led alliance supporting Miller and Johnson as well as the police and firefighter partnership behind Pacheco and Bei — have produced winning campaigns in the past.
 “it all comes down to who’s voting,” said Johnson, who has worked in California schools for 33 years and participated in his union for more than 20 years.
Mermell and Akkad have less resources, but could find themselves in a runoff. 
“Money talks, I thought that was only in politics, not in something like this,” said Akkad, who has been receiving political text messages from competing CalPERS campaigns. 
“It’s a mess. And I’m glad I’m different from them,” he said. 
Pacheco refused an interview request for this story. Bei said he was unavailable because of work commitments. 
Why the trades are spending on CalPERS
In a twist, the well-funded SEIU coalition behind Miller and Johnson previously supported Pacheco. The same groups in 2021 spent $483,000 through an independent expenditure committee to help him unseat former board member Margaret Brown. 
Johnson, who is a leader in the same public sector union that initially propelled Pacheco, said the California School Employees Association gradually lost trust in Pacheco and chose to break with him. 
Brown now is the president of a group called the Retired Public Employees Association, which has endorsed Bei and Pacheco and purchased campaign signs on their behalf.
Brown four years ago could not keep up with the union spending against her. She raised about $47,000 that year. Pacheco, with help from the trades, has a warchest to reach voters.

 The trades earlier this year sponsored a bill in the Legislature that would have prohibited public pension funds from investing in construction firms that do not adhere to prevailing wage or apprenticeship programs. That effectively would boost trades unions, but would also limit the pension fund’s options when it hires contractors for its $66 billion real estate holdings. The bill did not get a vote in a committee.
The trades also pressed CalPERS to adopt those rules on its own through the fund’s “responsible contractor policy,” which shapes about $1 billion in annual spending.
Reaffirming the policy without additional labor protections “will be a lost opportunity for CalPERS to use its market power to hold employers accountable and uplift the lives of local California construction workers and apprentices,” Jeremy Smith of the State Building and Construction Trades Council told the CalPERS board in March, according to a transcript. 
The vote did not go his way, with seven members affirming the policy without additional labor protections and three voting against it. Pacheco was a no vote. According to the meeting transcript, he said some aspects of the policy “have fallen short, with respect to prevailing wages for instance, the apprenticeship program.”
In a written statement, trades spokesperson Brooke Patton said the unions were supporting Pacheco because he “has shown a strong commitment to protecting their hard-earned retirement savings and has advocated for responsible contractor policies. He has demonstrated genuine respect for working people, and we believe it’s more important than ever to support that leadership.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-CalPERS-Election-Signs-MG-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Trena Turner served on the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2020. She is an ordained minister and the executive pastor of Victory In Praise Church in Stockton.


As a former California redistricting commissioner, I have witnessed firsthand the careful, deliberate and transparent process that drew our congressional lines to reflect the real people of our state. The work was not easy, but it was honorable — and it safeguarded the principle that every community deserves fair representation.
Which is why I am both alarmed and deeply disappointed at the way conversations around Proposition 50, California’s mid-cycle redistricting measure, have often been reduced to a single, shallow question: “What will it cost?”
Yes, this special election carries a financial cost. But if we view it only through dollars and cents, we ignore the greater risks. An estimated 3.4 million Californians stand to lose health care coverage due to Medicaid cuts, and another 3.1 million people — children, veterans and families — face the loss of vital nutrition assistance through SNAP. 
There are measurable consequences of this moment that will reshape the health and stability of our state, while steadily eroding the foundations of our democracy.
We cannot ignore the reality that this year’s map-redrawing in Texas and other states, at President Trump’s urging, has been widely challenged as racial gerrymandering. This continues a generational pattern in many states where lines are drawn to weaken Black, brown, immigrant and working-class voices so politicians can pick their voters.
The Constitution is clear: The role of Congress is to make laws and act as a check and balance to the executive branch. But the Republican-led Congress has failed to fulfill that role. Instead of standing as a safeguard, Congress has abdicated its responsibility and has been a rubber stamp for the president’s unconstitutional whims.
The burden for checking this abuse of power has now shifted to the states and to the people themselves. That is why California must do everything within its power to counter. Midterm redistricting is a moral necessity. We need to pass Prop. 50 and do what we can to hold the line.
The real cost of inaction shows up when children go hungry because their communities are drawn out of political power and their needs are ignored.
The real cost shows up when working families are silenced, while wealthy donors and entrenched politicians redraw maps to protect themselves.
The real cost shows up when generations of struggle for fair representation are erased by a pen stroke that divides neighborhoods and dissolves communities of interest.
And ultimately, the greatest cost is borne by our democracy itself. If we refuse to act because we are afraid of the dollar amount for a special election, then we are complicit in paying a far higher price in human dignity and democratic erosion.
Serving as a redistricting commissioner meant listening to thousands of Californians: parents, farmworkers, business owners, pastors, students, seniors and more. They shared stories of who they are and how their communities function, from the Central Valley to the coast, from urban cities to rural towns.
We honored the state Voting Rights Act, respected communities of interest and built maps in the open for everyone to see. It was democracy in action. It was Californians proving that independent, transparent redistricting is not only possible but necessary.
Now, faced with deliberate racial gerrymandering in other states and unchecked executive overreach at home, California must respond with equal determination.
Democracy is never free. Every generation is asked to invest something in its survival. But the question before us is not whether midterm redistricting is expensive. The question is whether we will further enable the unchecked cost of inhumane laws, unconstitutional abuses and far-reaching executive orders affecting ordinary Californians.
We’ve watched this presidential administration dismantle DEI programs and send the National Guard into our cities under false claims of “rampant crime” — all while cutting the very programs that reduced it. He has targeted and criminalized vulnerable people under the guise of “public safety.”
It is shortsighted for Californians to think only about California at this moment. To stand by and allow more of the same is to surrender to authoritarianism in slow motion. The safeguards we once believed would protect us simply aren’t holding.
Now is not the time for neutrality. If reversing course is what it takes to protect representation, equity and democracy itself, then we must act. 
The price of justice will always be less than the price of injustice. That is the truth we must remember before we decide what “cost” really means. It is why I urge every voting-age Californian to back Prop. 50, so we can temporarily set aside the 2020 congressional maps and do our part to stand against authoritarian overreach.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081425-Redistricting-Rally-TS-12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

That's a contested issue in an election for two seats on its board.,"In summary
CalPERS is putting more money in private equity as it seeks higher returns. That’s a contested issue in an election for two seats on its board.


Several candidates for the board of California’s largest public pension fund are complaining that the fund put its thumb on the scale of this month’s election by sending a message to all members before voting concludes.
The message promoted the California Public Employees’ Retirement System’s private equity investments — a contested issue in the election, with several of the candidates criticizing the investments’ associated fees. 
“Regardless of one’s view on private equity, sending such a communication while members are weighing their choices risks giving the appearance that staff are attempting to shape the outcome of an election rather than allowing members to decide for themselves,” candidate Steve Mermell, who is challenging an incumbent, wrote to the board after receiving the message.
CalPERS, a $584 billion pension fund that manages retirement benefits for 2 million people, is overseen by a 13-member board. Its members choose representatives for six of those positions. The other severn are either elected officials or appointees of the governor and Legislature. 
From Aug. 28 through Sept. 29, about 1.7 million CalPERS members are voting on two positions in a testy campaign fueled by public sector union money. 
CalPERS over the past several years ramped up its investments in private equity to $92 billion as it sought higher returns. CalPERS leaders maintain the strategy is working even after subtracting private equity fees.
Last year, CalPERS reported an 11.6% investment return, exceeding its target of 6.8%. This week’s message to CalPERS said, in part, “This strong result – the best in the last four fiscal years – was driven largely by the strength of our private equity investments.”
In an interview last week, CalPERS board member David Miller said, “I would point to private equity as a linchpin of that strategy. People are always saying, ‘CalPERS, use your size, use your size.’ That’s exactly what we’re doing.”
Miller is up for reelection this month. He’s facing Mermell, a retired Pasadena city manager, and Santa Monica firefighter Dom Bei. Bei on social media this week also criticized the timing of CalPERS’ message. 
“Let’s be honest: what they gave us wasn’t perspective at all,” former board member Margaret Brown wrote in a letter to the CalPERS board after the message was released. “It was a glossy narrative declaring private equity is awesome. Real perspective means hearing both sides, the risks and the rewards. What CalPERS gave us was a sales pitch.”
Brown is now a leader in a group called the Retired Public Employees Association, which is supporting Bei. 
CalPERS spokesperson James Scullary in a written statement said the message was tied to a discussion about the fund’s overall performance at its board meeting this week. 
“We know that our members are curious about private equity, so the release was timed to coincide with Monday’s board discussion around our investment returns, the role private equity played, and a proposed shift” to what CalPERS calls a “total portfolio approach.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/031522nCalPERS-MG-CM-09.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) 
About 50 people rallied Thursday outside of the headquarters for the New Mexico Environment Department calling for Secretary James Kenney’s resignation — the latest bout of tensions over proposed changes to regulation of wastewater from oil and gas fields. 
Earlier this year, the state water commission adopted rules to allow for oil and gas wastewater pilot projects, but no discharges into surface or groundwater, a decision seen as a victory for environmental groups.
State water quality board backs off controversial oil and gas project discharges

In June, a new petition requested the 12-member Water Quality Control Commission rewrite its May rule.
The petition was authored by an industry group known as WATR, which stands for Water, Access, Treatment and Reuse (WATR) Alliance, with board members from oil and gas giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and other industry interests. 
WATR’s proposed rule would allow 13 counties to use “treated produced water” for uses such as watering livestock, “non-food crops,” construction and releases into the environment. Kenney pushed for the petition to move forward. While letters from more than 25 Democratic lawmakers objected to the proposed rule change, the WATR alliance’s position has backing from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has pushed for using the oil and gas wastewater to address projected water shortfalls.
In August, commissioners — including five cabinet secretaries sitting on the board instead of their designees — voted to override environmental groups’ objections to the petition, and opted to move forward with a hearing on a possible rule change. That hearing has not yet been scheduled.
Amid strong opposition, New Mexico water board lets plan for more oil and gas wastewater use proceed

The Santa Fe New Mexican reported Monday on an emailed exchange in July between staff at the governor’s office and cabinet heads appointed to the Water Quality Control Commission encouraging them to attend the August meeting in-person and get WATR’s petition “over the finish line.” The emails also referenced closed-door meetings about the petition. 
Attendees at Thursday’s protest — which included members of organizations such as Youth United for Climate Crisis Action (YUCCA) New Mexico and parciantes from acequias —said the email exchange amounted to “rigging” the vote at the August meeting. 
“If we allow corruption and lies to stand, we lose more than clean water, we lose the belief that our voices can shape the future,” said Zain Dixon, a YUCCA steering committee member, into a microphone outside the Harold Runnels Building. “We demand accountability. We demand a full investigation into every email, every directive, every backroom conversation, and we demand leaders who serve the people, not the oil and gas industry.”
The governor’s office denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Source NM Thursday. 
“Cabinet secretaries are statutorily required to serve on the commission and have every right to participate directly in important votes. The administration’s position on water reuse has been public for months. Directing secretaries to attend required meetings rather than send staff does not violate any laws,” said Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for Lujan Grisham’s office, in a statement. “Secretary Kenney has the Governor’s confidence and will continue in his role.”
Kenney responded to Source NM in a statement through an environment department spokesperson. 
“The New Mexico Environment Department respects the right to peaceful protest and public expression on all environmental issues and encourages public participation in our regulatory processes,” said NMED Director of Communications Drew Goretzka. “NMED and Sec. Kenney make science-based decisions and expect the same of the Water Quality Control Commission. The Administration’s position supporting water reuse regulations is outlined in the state’s 50-Year Water Action Plan released in 2024. NMED also has a legal obligation to pass water reuse regulations under the Produced Water Act. NMED technical and legal staff are meeting with WATR to review their petition against our policy and scientific standards.”
The New Mexico oil and gas industry generates billions of gallons of wastewater. The mixture is extremely salty and poses challenges for treatment since it can contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, toxic chemicals and cancer-causing compounds from the oil and gas, such as benzene. Oil and gas companies can use compounds protected as trade secrets in the mixture, which do not have to be disclosed to regulators or the public.

Eleanor Smith, a community organizer with Tó Nizhóní Ání, an organization fighting pollution on the Navajo Nation, drove four hours from her four corners home in Shiprock to attend the protest, saying the issue hits personally, due to the oil and gas development in the San Juan Basin. 
“There is a lot of fracking on sacred lands and no thought for us as people,” Smith said. 
Santiago Maestas, 76, a farmer in Pajarito in the South Valley of Albuquerque, said that while he had not previously participated in the hearings, he believed now the issue was too large to ignore. 
“It’s time that we step forward and resist the contamination in our air, water and in our land,” he said, adding that he had one message to New Mexico’s officials on water saying in Spanish: “Don’t sell it, defend it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Zain-and-Vittoria-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Guest Commentary written by

Jeanne Raya
Jeanne Raya is the head of an insurance agency and lives in San Gabriel. She was the chair of California’s first independent redistricting commission.


In 2008, the Voters First Act created California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission, an independent body consisting of people who reflected the state’s diversity. Good government groups pushed the ballot measure forward, seeking to make sure voters were — as the law’s name declared — put first. I served on the first commission two years later.
Voter approval of an independent commission effectively ended the backroom partisan gerrymandering that characterized redistricting in California for decades.
Commission members spent nearly a year drawing new maps, giving citizens access to more than 100 public meetings and different ways to submit written comments. Voters could describe their communities, their environment, their infrastructure and their economy. This gave the commission a picture of the whole of California and helped it create districts that gave voters a fair chance at electing accountable representatives.
California’s commission is now considered the gold standard for U.S. redistricting, free of partisan self-interest and conducted fully in public view.
If only Texas could learn from California. There, lawmakers adopted new maps in August in an attempt to rig the 2026 election in favor of Republicans — at the behest of President Donald Trump. Their actions represent the basest motivations of politicians so fearful of losing power, all they can think to do is cheat.
Their determination to stack the congressional deck prompted Gov. Gavin Newsom to pursue retaliatory mid-cycle redistricting in California to elect more Democrats. It’s now in the hands of voters in a special election on Nov. 4. Proposition 50 would replace the maps drawn by the state’s independent commission with districts drawn by legislators solely to gain or protect Democratic seats. And that protection will extend through three election cycles.
That is hardly a temporary change.
As a registered Democrat, I would celebrate replacing members of Congress who have forgotten their oath to serve constituents and protect the Constitution. But it can’t be at the expense of California’s Constitution — nor its voters who mandated fair, nonpartisan redistricting.
Newsom said the move by Texas Republicans justifies a retaliatory strike. But we witness daily the chaos and mistrust created by revenge politics in Washington. That is not the model of responsible government Californians deserve. Nor do Californians want to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to gamble that different congressional districts will produce the sought-after change, while real problems remain unaddressed.
No one knows the magic number of blue seats needed to win this electoral war, especially as more red states jump in beside Texas. Is the governor willing to risk losing incumbents in more competitive California districts? Will he accept failure if Democrats fall short nationwide?
This is not an unprecedented moment. We’ve seen for decades how partisan gerrymandering suppresses voters’ choice, undermining trust and feeding cynicism. We know that once given power, politicians will fight to retain it with the confidence that a declaration of crisis is all the cover they need.
Newsom should look for a different response to redistricting warfare.
U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, for example, proposed legislation to ban mid-decade redistricting nationwide. I don’t know what brought Kiley, a Placer County Republican, to this moment. Perhaps it’s self-preservation under the threat of being gerrymandered out of his seat. But considering a national solution to a national problem would be a welcome undertaking.
Newsom says Democrats can take back Congress if the American people are given a fair chance, a voice and a choice. In California, the people already have that chance, and it’s the independent redistricting commission.
Californians can send a clear message to Newsom and legislative leaders on Nov. 4 to respect the will of the people and not sacrifice the independent redistricting commission, nor the state’s limited financial resources, for short-term political gain.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090625-CA-GOP-OC-JAH-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

The Boulder […]","Rendering of design plans submitted by Pinkbox in its application to Boulder City Planning Commission.Pinkbox Doughnuts is attempting to open a new shop in Boulder City by the end of the year, but the company’s plans for a pair of poop emoji-shaped mascots in front of the building, and the fact public dollars may fund their creation and installation, is creating quite a stink with local residents.
The Boulder City Planning Commission on Wednesday unanimously denied Pinkbox’s request to feature two 3D freestanding road signs of their pink and brown poop emoji “brand icons.” Pinky and Pooh, as they are known and trademarked by the company, would be outside the entrance and depicted as holding up an existing overhang on the building.
Residents who spoke during the commission’s public hearing opposed the requested zone variance, calling the poop emojis “offensive” and saying they lack class. They argued the figures don’t fit the historic, small-town aesthetic that Boulder City prides itself on.
Pinkbox needs approval from the planning commission because the city ordinances only allow businesses to have one advertising structure along each street frontage.
The poop emojis are considered advertising structures, as opposed to a piece of art that the city has less say in, because they are uniquely identifiable to the company. City staff described them as being more akin to McDonald’s Golden Arches than the generic chef statue or pig illustration featured outside Fox Smokehouse BBQ in Boulder City.
Boulder City code also requires advertising structures to be 100 feet apart, and Pinkbox wants to space Pinky and Pooh and a third, non-controversial doughnut-shaped road sign between 25 and 63 feet apart.
Pinkbox plans to open a location at 849 Nevada Way, at the corner of Elm Street. The property, a former 7-11 convenience store that has been vacant since 2022, is not part of the city’s formal historic district. It is located in what some refer to as the “Motel Sign District,” an unofficial area that features numerous vintage or vintage-inspired signs. Boulder City has previously awarded redevelopment dollars to support sign restoration projects.
The Pinkbox building is already slated to be mostly bright pink and white, with sprinkles on the facade and a doughnut arch entrance. Those features already conform to city ordinances.
Even sans poop emojis, some residents believe Pinkbox will have a negative impact on how Boulder City’s main thoroughfare is perceived by the public.
While Wednesday’s planning commission hearing was focused on the poop emojis, Tara Leon-Bertoli, owner of Boulder City Company Store, told the Nevada Current that local opposition to a Pinkbox in Boulder City goes beyond the gaudy.
In her eyes Pinkbox is a deep-pocketed chain that is “trying to infiltrate” a small town and not invested in truly being part of the community.
“That’s not what we’re all about,” Leon-Bertoli said of Boulder City. “We’re about small business owners who have put everything they have into this one place. Whose kids go to school with everyone, and where the teachers come in. It’s not just about owning property.”
Pinkbox is part of The Siegel Group, a large real estate firm best known for its extended-stay chain Siegel Suites. Amazing Brands, the food and beverage side of the group, operates 14 Pinkbox locations across Nevada and Utah, as well as Siegel’s Bagelmania and Piero’s Italian Cuisine in Las Vegas.
Leon-Bertoli and others are disappointed the Boulder City Council, meeting as the redevelopment board, on Aug. 12 approved Pinkbox for $97,600 in funds to assist in updating the property’s exterior paint, lighting, landscaping and signage. The city’s redevelopment program allows for businesses in the city’s downtown corridor to recoup up to 30% of spending on eligible updates and improvements.
Councilmembers did question whether a Siegel Group company needs any assistance developing a new store. Redevelopment dollars are explicitly designed to support projects where “no other reasonable means of financing is obtainable.”
The city attorney noted that Boulder City PB Holdings LLC, the Siegel affiliate receiving the money, signed an affidavit stating the redevelopment dollars are needed because otherwise they “would not have a reasonable rate of return.” It is by statute an acceptable response, the attorney noted.
Leon-Bertoli remains skeptical.
She also thinks the city needs to focus their efforts on reducing the barriers that stop small entrepreneurs like her from accessing redevelopment dollars. She received funds from the city six years ago to restore to its 1930s style the building that now houses Boulder City Co. Store.
Redevelopment grants are essentially reimbursements, provided only after the restoration or updates have been completed. Smaller businesses have a more difficult time upfronting the costs, she said. The time it takes to get approval can be monthslong.
“Rich companies can afford to wait that long and pay all those bills associated with the purchase of the property until the funding is available,” she said.
Pinkbox’s holding company has been sitting on a separate property — the former Little City Grille — for two years. It purchased the only 7-11 early last year with little public activity until recently.
Leon-Bertoli acknowledges that Boulder City Co. Store, which serves Peet’s Coffee and Carl’s Donuts, would be a direct competitor to Pinkbox. She says she’s “all about healthy competition” but doesn’t see Pinkbox as a healthy addition for her hometown.

After the redevelopment board meeting, Leon-Bertoli hung a sign outside the side of her building that reads “Get Donuts and Coffee on the other side of this pinkbox.” The sign features Boulder City Co. Store’s logo but also a conspicuously bright pink background with sprinkles.
On Thursday, a day after the planning commission hearing, Leon-Bertoli received a cease and desist letter from Pinkbox demanding she take down the sign. The letter, viewed by the Current, accuses Leon-Bertoli of willfully deceptive and illegal trade practices by using trademarked materials and trying to confuse customers.
The letter also alleges Leon-Bertoli made “disparaging, libelous” remarks about Pinkbox, including its trademarked phrase “so good you’ll lick the box.” Leon-Bertoli the night prior told planning commissioners the motto was sexually suggestive and referencing women’s anatomy.
“I don’t know if this town understands that,” she said during the meeting, “but that’s not small-town agenda. I don’t know why they’d think we want that type of humor to grace the downtown corridor.”
Back to the poop emojis
“Just to be clear: These are 10-foot tall, 11-foot wide, 6-foot deep turds,” said Brandon Smith, a homeowner in the historic district who spoke in opposition to the zone variance. “These emojis, they have to go.”
No existing Pinkbox location features the poop emoji mascots as part of their external building design, and their inclusion in the Boulder City design “feels disrespectful,” said Smith.
The mascots, he added, are likely most appealing to young children, something Boulder City is known for having “a dwindling population of.”
Smith and others noted there is an ongoing effort to get the area formally designated as a historic district in its own right.
They argue that existing businesses have signage from, or in line with, Googie architectural style. Known better by sight than by name, Googie style is a futuristic, space-age aesthetic marking the car-centric postwar era of America. The starbursts on the iconic “Welcome to Las Vegas” sign and Stardust resort sign is considered a signature element of the style.
In Boulder City, Southwest Diner, Nevada Inn, Sands Motel, and El Rancho Motel — all located on Nevada Way — have signs in the design style. The vacant Flamingo Inn, which is directly across the street from the planned Pinkbox, also hopes to feature a Googie-style sign.
City Councilman Steve Walton during the August meeting noted the proposed design is “inconsistent” with the area.
“I appreciate corporate logos and marketing,” he said, “but it’s almost like, ‘Hey, I’m going to paint your car pink and I want you to pay for it.’ Like, no thanks.”
City Councilwoman Denise Ashurst also encouraged the company to consider a “more vintage” design.
Planning Commissioner Lorene Krumm on Wednesday noted that, aside from sizing and spacing restrictions, the city does not have requirements related to the aesthetic design of signage, meaning “there will always be those comments and concerns” about businesses not fitting the vibe of the area.

At the state’s top air regulator, Lauren Sanchez will replace Liane Randolph, taking the helm as California battles Trump, rising costs, and the future of its climate agenda.


The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles the Trump administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.
Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.
Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.
“I’ve worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I’m ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”
Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.
“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”
California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition
Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.
Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”
But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”
While Randolph’s air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.
“Liane didn’t have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”
For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists.  In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.
Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the  board through a difficult time. 
In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions. 
“She’s always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”
Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions. 
The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.
“There’s not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration’s attacks on all of California’s efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.
“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California’s authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”
Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.
“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”
Searing climate battles at home
Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel. 
The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.
Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties. 
“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.
Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.
“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what’s working — and what’s not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that’s not something staff have ever embraced.”
Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.
Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.
Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.
“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.
Newsom’s point person steps in
Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.
Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”
Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.
“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”
Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.
“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.
Next week, the state’s top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.
Many of the air board’s recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.
Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”
“Everyone breathing in California depends on it,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/062322-CARB-MEETING-RL-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to terminate National Institutes of Health grants addressing diversity, equity and inclusion issues, Utah’s flagship university has reported a loss of about $8.4 million from 13 awards affected by the federal cuts. 
Some of the affected awards were for health-related research, including a project meant to study the genetic diversity of pathogens to help inform the developments of antimicrobials and  vaccines, and a study that aimed to further the understanding of mental health needs of ethnically diverse college students.
Others were programs that provided high school and graduate students to gain experience in research, Julie Kiefer, director of research communications at the University of Utah, said in an email.

“Some researchers have been able to secure temporary funding but will need to identify alternative sources of funding to support their projects over the long-term,” Kiefer wrote. “The student training programs will not be able to continue if funding is not reinstated.”
Those training programs include U of U Step Up, which provides high school students of underrepresented backgrounds with biomedical science research opportunities, and Intermountain PREP, which intends to cover gaps in STEM education for students of diverse backgrounds. They are part of larger national programs managed by NIH, and terminated nationwide, Kiefer said. Currently, there is no indication that funding for these programs will be restored, she said in a statement.
According to Grant Witness, a database recording how the new policy has affected NIH grants, out of the 13 terminated awards, four are listed as possibly reinstated. A researcher on one of those projects confirmed the grant was recently returned, but said it is unclear why.
No other public university in the state was listed in the database, and compared to other states across the country, Utah is listed as moderately impacted by the terminations, way behind states like New York, Illinois, Massachusetts and California, which show the most extensive impacts.
The University of Utah only offered prepared statements after multiple requests for an interview on the status of its NIH grants.
Alzheimer’s research at risk
Jason Shepherd, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Utah’s school of medicine, who spoke to Utah News Dispatch in a personal capacity and not representing the school, said that amid all the federal budget changes, the issue isn’t just the termination of grants, but also the ongoing lack of clarity for future research funding.
Some of his peers have had awards taken away based on keywords used in their proposals, he said. According to The New York Times, federal agencies have flagged a variety of words for review in grant proposals and contracts that could conflict with President Donald Trump’s executive orders limiting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among others. 
In Shepherd’s case, the issue wasn’t a keyword, but the repercussions of the budget uncertainties that NIH is facing. 
“The NIH is giving out less numbers of grants this year, and there’s just been chaos in terms of what the budget was going to be, what the next year’s budget is going to be,” Shepherd said. “The way the money has been mandated to be spent this year has influenced how many grants can get out.”
One of the projects Shepherd has been trying to fund with NIH awards focuses on studying a mechanism in which Alzheimer’s disease spreads across the brain once patients start to experience memory loss.

“If we could stop that from happening, we could effectively stop the progression of the disease,” he said.
His lab has pursued this investigation for the last five years, testing animal models and post-mortem human brain tissue. 
“In order to lay down the sort of road tracks for drug discovery and making new therapies, this is the work that has to be done,” Shepherd said.
The team receives funding from private foundations like the Alzheimer’s Association, which is keeping the project going for the moment, he said. But, without a long-term NIH grant, the future of the research is becoming more and more uncertain.
“This grant that we applied for is a five-year grant. We would get half a million dollars per year to do the work,” he said. “But without that, I can’t hire anyone to do the work. We can’t pay for the animal facility. We can’t pay for reagents. So basically, it won’t be able to go ahead.”
It’s hard to tell how long it would take Shepherd’s team to develop a drug or therapy for humans, he said. But so far, they have revealed new insights into a disease that has seen little breakthroughs in the last decades.
If the lab isn’t able to secure NIH funding — which in the past he had no issue receiving — he’ll be forced to start laying people off starting next year. On top of that, he worries what this would mean for science and recruiting in research institutions in the country.
“If we’re looking at graduate programs, we’ve always been able to get the best and brightest students in the world, basically because of the science that’s happening in the states,” Shepherd said. “And, University of Utah is doing really well, especially at the medical school, and all of that momentum is now in jeopardy because of what’s happening to the NIH and in general, the sort of anti-immigration viewpoints that are laws that are being put in place.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Public Library Service will continue withholding state funding from the Fairhope Public Library amid an ongoing dispute over how the library handles challenges to some books.
Members of the APLS Board Thursday voted to review some of the challenged books and decide for themselves if they meet the APLS’ definition of sexually explicit materials.
The decision was the latest battle in an ongoing fight over books in libraries around the state that conservative groups have claimed are sexually explicit but which opponents say amount to attacks on literature with LGBTQ+ characters or themes.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We are very disappointed that they are putting this off again,” said Randal Wright, chair of the board of trustees for the Fairhope Public Library, in an interview following the decision. “We believe very strongly that we are in compliance, and that the definition of sexually explicit is a subjective thing. You just can’t define it with words; it is emotional as well as objective.”
Representatives from the library addressed APLS board members after the public comment period in the hopes of getting their funding reinstated. Board member Ronald Snider requested the board take a vote to authorize that funding be released, but no one else on the board supported his request.
“I think it is very troubling that we, who espouse small government, are here saying that we are going to decide what is appropriate, that these books are obscene,” Snider said. “What we are doing is listening to a small minority of people in Fairhope who are never going to be satisfied.”
Instead, the board voted for Chair John Wahl’s motion for the Fairhope Public Library to provide APLS with a list of the challenged books, in order for each member to review the materials themselves and decide if they are sexually explicit and should be removed from the teenagers’ section of the library.
“If it is a book that contains sexually explicit content, as defined in the definition created by this board, we want parents to make that call,” Wahl said. “We are not saying the book is bad, we are not saying the book doesn’t have literary value, but what we are saying is that we want parents to make those decisions when it comes to materials that are challenging.”
APLS voted to suspend state aid for the library after some patrons spoke out against the library. The library’s supporters responded by fundraising to help offset the $21,000 in state aid that APLS withheld. The library began to review the books that parents said should not be in the section for minors.
Since the suspension, roughly 10 patrons of the Fairhope Public Library who attended APLS meetings have accused Fairhope Public Library of shelving books they consider sexually explicit, in violation of the administrative code APLS adopted in the summer of 2024, which required libraries to adopt policies that restrict library materials to minors that are “inappropriate for children and youth.” It also prohibits libraries from purchasing such materials and requires advance approval for placing materials on display meant for minors.
Libraries must also have a policy that requires minors to receive permission from their parents before checking out library materials in the adult section.
The APLS board last year approved an update to the administrative code to further define the term “sexually explicit” and include materials with sexual intercourse, sexual excitement, nudity and masturbation.
After the administrative code was adopted, parents told the APLS board that the Fairhope Public Library continued to have books in the minors’ section that are sexually explicit.
Wright said the library completed the review of the books that were challenged and moved seven of the 14 book titles that patrons challenged. Wright said he believed the library complied with the directive from APLS as well as the updated administrative code.
APLS board members and library officials discussed the issue for almost an hour on Thursday.
During the meeting, Wright asked APLS to provide the titles of the books they wanted reshelved and the reason that Fairhope was singled out as the library that had its funding rescinded.
Wahl said there was not a list of specific books that were targeted to be reshelved.
“When you refused parents’ redress or grievance, you left this board with a vote of no choice but to get involved,” Wahl said to Wright. “I think that is what made Fairhope different, was the refusal of giving redress of grievance for parents.”
Wright said the books that parents challenged were reviewed before the administrative code was updated in the summer of 2024, and the director at the time decided to keep the books in the same location.
She then said that the library’s policy was to keep the books that were challenged in place for the next five years, a standard practice for most libraries.
“It wasn’t so much that we were refusing, we were just saying they had already been reviewed,” Wright said. “Fill out an appeal, and we will do it again if we need to because we were willing to talk about it.”
She said that patrons who challenged the books did not approach the library board after that but instead went before the Fairhope City Council and the APLS board.
Prior to requesting that funding for the Fairhope Public Library be restored, Snider said that the APLS board is on a path of censoring library materials. He criticized the decision, saying he believes in local control, and that decisions about library materials should be left to local library boards who oversee the content.
“Is this board going to decide for itself what book in Fairhope, in Birmingham, or Ashland, Alabama, what we think is obscene?” Snider asked facetiously.
Snider then asked if libraries are supposed to remove a book if even one patron challenges its location.
“If it goes against state code, they must,” Wahl said.
Wahl then requested the titles of the books that were challenged and the decisions that the library made about where the books will be placed.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250918_141510-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

The financial crisis at Southern Inyo Healthcare District comes as 


Inyo County, on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, has two hospitals. In a matter of weeks it may be down to one, local and state officials say.
Southern Inyo Healthcare District, a 37-bed hospital in Lone Pine, had eight days of cash on hand as of Sept.12, chief executive Dr. Kevin Flanigan told CalMatters. Local officials have sent a letter asking Gov. Gavin Newsom for an emergency $3 million to stabilize its finances through the end of the year, but absent state intervention the hospital may have to severely cut services and staff — or close altogether.
“If they don’t come through and nobody else comes through then…the board of directors is going to have some very hard decisions to make,” Flanigan said. 
On average, hospitals generally have more than 200 days of cash on hand, according to a recent KFF analysis. Hospitals with less than 80 days of cash on hand are considered “highly vulnerable” to a “financial crisis.”
Located in Lone Pine, a town at the base of Mt. Whitney with just 1,300 residents, Southern Inyo Healthcare District is the only hospital within a nearly 60-mile radius. It’s the closest stop for injured hikers and dehydrated tourists visiting Whitney or nearby Death Valley, which regularly receives over 1 million visitors per year. Without it there would be a 136-mile stretch between the next closest hospitals in the eastern Sierra Nevada.
The hospital’s financial distress comes as rural hospitals across the country face rising costs related to labor and supplies as well as projected future decreases in revenue from federal Medicaid cuts. Three weeks ago Glenn Medical Center, the only hospital in Glenn County in Northern California, said it would shut down by October. 
Assemblymember David Tangipa, Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil, and Inyo County supervisors said in the letter to Newsom that the hospital faces a short-term deficit and a one-time infusion from the state would be enough to stabilize the facility long term.
“If doors close, thousands of elderly and rural Californians will be left without access to critical healthcare, creating a true medical desert in another region of the state,” the letter says. 
Sami Gallegos, a spokesperson for the California Health and Human Services agency, said in a statement that the administration is working with Southern Inyo Healthcare District to expedite payments due to the hospital “where possible.” 
“Our top priority is to ensure Californians in all areas of the state have access to quality, equitable health care,” Gallegos said.
She did not address whether the administration would be able to give the hospital the emergency infusion of cash it has requested.
Hospital struggles to pay bills, employees
During a board meeting Tuesday, Flanigan said the hospital has about $2 million in unpaid bills. Since asking the state for help, the hospital has received about $11,000 in payment owed for medical services.“It’s small stuff, but important,” he said. “It’s helping us make payroll.”
Will Wadelton, the county supervisor for the area that encompasses the hospital, said the county doesn’t have the money to bail the hospital out. 
“We are pursuing all other options to keep the hospital solvent,” Wadelton said, including soliciting donations and hoping for state intervention.

It’s unclear how lawmakers could appropriate money to the hospital quickly. Local officials requested emergency funding on the last regular day of the legislative session, meaning the state’s checkbook can’t be adjusted until lawmakers reconvene in January.
Flanigan said he is still hopeful the hospital will find a solution.
Flanigan, who started the job as CEO just four weeks ago, said the hospital’s dire financial straits had been masked by leftover money from the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time the federal government pumped billions of dollars into health care to help keep hospitals and other facilities afloat while costs rose and other revenue sources declined. State agencies received more than $109 billion in 2021 to support health services while counties and cities got additional money to assist with local response.
Flanigan said emergency funding from the state would give him time to reduce operating costs to a sustainable level and allow the facility to access additional revenue expected in January that would sustain the hospital in the long term. 
“With this funding I would be able to adjust the operations of the hospital without being disruptive and have the highest probability of success,” Flanigan said.
Money from the $50 billion rural health fund included in the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” to placate conservative lawmakers from rural states would not be available soon enough to help Southern Inyo Healthcare District, he said.
In Northern California, Glenn Medical’s financial difficulties began when the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stripped it of its “critical access” status — a special designation given to qualifying rural hospitals — causing it to lose 40% of its revenue.
Southern Inyo Healthcare District is also a critical access hospital.
“It’s of utmost importance to us to not let another rural hospital close,” said Austin Gilbert, a spokesperson for Tangipa’s office.

A deputy in southwest Missouri was convicted of assaulting another deputy’s wife. An officer in southeast Missouri who kicked a man on the ground and wrote a misleading report was fired. 
They kept their Missouri police licenses and are still working as officers, despite being brought before a state discipline board.
Misconduct is supposed to be reported to the Missouri Department of Public Safety, but sometimes it takes years for that to happen — if it’s ever done. Police department officials aren’t required to report misconduct within a certain amount of time and face no consequences for failing to do so. Missouri isn’t a state that automatically revokes a police license when an officer is convicted of a serious crime.

The Marshall Project – St. Louis reviewed over 600 misconduct allegations vetted by two agencies before going before a state commission. The review unveiled a process that can take years to address a problem and routinely allows officers who have committed serious wrongdoing to keep their jobs. 
The findings raise questions about how effective the state is at rooting out cops who have violated their duties. Many even continue to work while under investigation. 
Police accountability advocates say Missouri’s system undermines public safety and trust.
“The stakes are just too high when it comes to law enforcement and the power that they hold over people’s lives,” said Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project.
Missouri’s police licensing system has loose regulations enforced by a web of agencies. State law also prevents Department of Public Safety officials from disclosing where officers worked in the past. The so-called muni shuffle, when an officer moves around to different municipalities, can be an indicator that they’ve run into trouble in their career.
Z Gorley, a spokesperson for the legal advocacy organization ArchCity Defenders, said they were concerned not only about the potential for officers to switch departments, but also about transparency.
The Missouri Department of Public Safety is responsible for issuing the police licenses required to work as a sworn officer. Its Peace Officer Standards and Training program investigates reports of misconduct. The department’s spokesperson, Mike O’Connell, said anyone can submit a complaint, though most come from police departments. When department officials learn of an incident through news reports, they can also open a case.
If officials determine an officer should face discipline, they then send the case to the Missouri attorney general’s office. Officials there can file a complaint with the Administrative Hearing Commission, which decides if discipline is warranted. If it is, the deputy director can suspend or revoke a license, or place it on probation, O’Connell said.
Missouri Department of Public Safety Director Mark James and officials with the Administrative Hearing Commission declined an interview. The Missouri attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis analyzed 627 cases handled by the Administrative Hearing Commission dating back to 2014. The analysis identified information, including the nature of the allegation, the approximate length of time between the incident and the beginning of formal proceedings, and the outcome. It took a median of at least 539 days for a complaint to be filed. One officer pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in 2008, but his case was brought to the commission in 2022. 
That officer’s license is on probation.

In half of the cases involving a death, it took over a year to get a case filed. A complaint was filed three and a half years after former Missouri State Trooper Anthony Piercy handcuffed a man to a boat, who was then ejected and drowned. Conversely, when former St. Louis Police Officer Nathaniel Hendren fatally shot another officer while playing a game, a case was filed five days later.
The commission can also slow the process. A case filed in November 2021 remains unresolved. Sometimes that gives officers the chance to get a new job before they are penalized. 
Of the 627 cases that reached the commission, 73 involved allegations of sexual misconduct. Of those, 33 involved children. A complaint filed last year alleged a former St. Louis police officer forced a 7-year-old girl to have oral sex. Child welfare services substantiated the accusation. An evidentiary hearing on his license is scheduled for Oct. 7. He has since gotten a job with a different department.
Out of the 627 complaints, 135 officers surrendered their licenses and 150 had them revoked. The rest were unresolved, on probation, suspended or expired. In some cases, officers convicted of crimes including fraud and armed bank robbery were allowed to keep their license until it expired.

Even after an officer has been criminally charged, cases fail to reach the commission. 
A glaring example is that of Eric DeValkenaere, a former Kansas City detective who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a 2019 shooting. When his prison sentence was commuted in December 2024, he was still licensed. A department spreadsheet dated June 30 shows DeValkenaere has now surrendered it. Several officers who have appeared in news stories because of criminal charges have not faced formal actions on their licenses. 
O’Connell said the Missouri Department of Public Safety cannot control delays in reporting incidents to the state agency or the pace at which cases move with the attorney general’s office and the commission. Criminal cases also take precedence over licensing. The department has taken steps to strengthen the system, he said, including implementing a program that alerts department officials when an officer is arrested. It doesn’t include officers who attended law enforcement training before 2018. 
Requiring police officials to report misconduct within a certain amount of time is an easy, common-sense solution, said Megan Crane, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit civil rights firm.
Carlton Mayers II, an attorney and policing reform expert, suggested instituting automatic decertification for some convictions and allowing the Missouri Department of Public Safety to act independently from the attorney general’s office and the Administrative Hearing Commission.
Other states have strengthened their police licensing oversight structures. In Illinois, officers convicted of felonies and certain misdemeanors automatically lose their license. Following the 2024 fatal shooting of Sonya Massey, Illinois also signed a measure requiring more thorough background checks that include an officer’s performance records and internal investigations. Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New Hampshire have also passed legislation in recent years. In neighboring Kansas, the public has access to a police officer’s employment history, and the state’s Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training has direct authority to revoke a license. 
O’Connell said the Missouri Department of Public Safety has increased its investigators from one to four, and in recent years has “more aggressively sought voluntary peace officer license surrenders,” which resolves cases more quickly than going through the Administrative Hearing Commission.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Melanie_Garcia_STL-OFFICER-MISCONDUCT-DATABASE_header_250909-1024x536.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Photo by John McDonnell/Getty Images)Jimmy Kimmel’s indefinite suspension from his late night television job after a Trump administration official publicly urged ABC and its parent company Disney to “take action on Kimmel” prompted warnings of government censorship from several quarters Thursday, including congressional Democrats, former President Barack Obama, and, closer to home, the ACLU of Nevada, and Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen.
Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the ACLU of Nevada, along with the civil liberties nonprofit’s legal director Chris Peterson, took to a social media broadcast Thursday to fold the Kimmel issue into the many recent efforts to chill free speech.
The Nevada organization normally focuses on “dire and grave threats” to the rights of Nevadans, Haseebullah noted, but the network yanking Kimmel from his show after being urged to act by Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr “raises a series of issues.”
The late night host on Monday commented on the Republican response to the death of Republican activist and influencer Charlie Kirk during his opening monologue. 
“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA Gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” he said at the time. 
Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency that regulates various communication platforms like broadcast, told a right-wing commentator that “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”
Haseebullah said Kimmel’s monologue wasn’t “bombastic” and didn’t use obscene or prohibitive language that could result in an FCC fine.
“He never called for a threat, he never broke a First Amendment rule. He never violated a free speech principle,” he said. “This is basically saying ‘we don’t like what he said, let’s cancel him.’”
After Carr urged ABC to “take action,” Nexstar Media Group, one of the nation’s largest owners or local TV stations, announced its ABC affiliates would be preempting Kimmel’s show “for the foreseeable future.”
ABC subsequently yanked Kimmel from the air.
Nexstar is currently in the process of a $6.2 billion merger with a media company called Tegna, a deal that will require approval from the FCC.
“You have a government official who’s in charge of potentially approving an FCC deal that’s $6 billion,” Haseebullah said, adding the FCC was “potentially shutting down that type of communication by issuing veiled threats.”
Peterson, the legal director for the ACLU of Nevada, said ABC’s decision to pull content wouldn’t normally raise any flags. 
“They’re a private company and they can choose what they want to do,” he said. “But if you start following the links – I don’t think this administration is being subtle about it – back to what’s going on here, where the source was for this pulling, then you start having First Amendment chilling.” 
Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen sent a letter Thursday asking Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz to hold a hearing to investigate Carr’s “threat to revoke public broadcasting licenses under its public interest authority in order to compel networks to censor programming with which he disagrees.” 
“The government censoring speech it disagrees with is what happens in dictatorships, not democracies,” Rosen, a member of the Commerce Committee, said in a statement announcing the letter. “This isn’t about whether someone likes Jimmy Kimmel’s jokes or not; it is about the fact that every American has the right to speak without government interference.”
The ACLU’s virtual discussion Thursday comes amid a flurry of actions in the aftermath of Kirk’s death that are prompting people to question what qualifies as attacks on free speech.
A number of Nevadans have been dismissed or reprimanded for social media posts about Kirk’s death, raising questions about  whether being terminated or suspended for posting on private social media is a violation of individual rights. 
Not wanting to give specific legal advice, Haseebullah and Peterson spoke more broadly about employee rights to free speech, which they characterized as a gray area that depends on a variety of factors.
Some of the variables include whether an employee works for a private company versus a government entity.
“The ultimate qualifier for all of this is if you’re part of a union, and that union has signed a collective bargaining agreement that includes a portion with respect to speech,” Haseebullah said. 
Peters added in those cases, “go check your contract.”
Censorship and attacks on free speech isn’t anything new, Haseebullah said, noting as an example crackdowns on people protesting against Israel’s actions against the people in Palestine, including blocking food and aid relief to Gaza, as well as Congress continuing to provide billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.
“We know there’s been censorship for a number of years on different issues,” Haseebullah said. “We’ve seen that happening for a while. But since January, it seems like it’s exploded.”
While flying home for the United Kingdom, Donald Trump Thursday praised Carr, and complained about TV network coverage of him and his presidency, saying “maybe their licence should be taken away.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2215644444-scaled-e1758285963569-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

Gavin Newsom approved $750 million in tax credits for Hollywood, he added to $100 billion in annual tax breaks or kickbacks California companies already enjoy.","When Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders were negotiating a final state budget last June, they reduced some health and welfare programs to help close a multi-billion-dollar gap between income and outgo.
Nevertheless, they agreed to more than double the state’s subsidy to Southern California’s film and video industry, which enjoys strong political clout, by setting aside $750 million for tax credits, to induce producers to shoot in California rather than in some other state or country.
“You’ve got to be competitive, and now we’re competitive,” Newsom said as he signed Assembly Bill 1138 at a Burbank studio. “Not to be the cheapest place to do business — that’s never been California’s brand or motto going back a century. We want to be the best place.”
The film and video subsidy is only one way that California’s state and local governments steer money into favored economic sectors or even specific corporations. There are dozens of  “tax expenditures” in the state’s tax systems — so many that the state Department of Finance annually publishes a report on who gets them and how much they cost.
While the budget expands Hollywood’s new tax subsidy, it also tightens up the calculation of corporate income taxes paid by the banking industry. In effect it’s raising taxes on one sector to indirectly pay for lowering them on another.
Overall, California’s tax expenditures reduce revenues by more than $100 billion a year, roughly equivalent to 50% of the state’s general fund budget. Public employee unions and their allies are proposing the state close some corporate tax breaks to reduce its chronic deficit.
At the local level, cities and some counties for decades used redevelopment to encourage investment in neighborhoods deemed to be blighted, redirecting some taxes in the so-called redevelopment zones back into the pockets of developers.
When Jerry Brown returned to the governorship in 2011, he persuaded the Legislature to end redevelopment, thereby shifting more property taxes to school districts, which reduced the state’s financial obligation to schools and helped Brown balance the state budget.
Redevelopment, however, is not the only way local governments, particularly cities, use subsidies to encourage investment on the theory that public coffers will see net revenue benefits.  Another way is to entice businesses that sell taxable goods and services by rebating a share of sales taxes back to sellers.
A new report from the Legislature’s budget analyst details two ways for rebate subsidies to be structured. One involves persuading the owner of a physical store of some kind to relocate from another community. The other is “encouraging retailers to shift the legally-defined place of sale without changing the location of any real economic activity.”
Generally one percentage point of the overall sales tax — which can range from 7.25% to 11.25% of the sale price — returns to the community in which the sale takes place. However, the designated sales point can be manipulated to favor a city that agrees to rebate a share of that tax back to the seller. In an age of decreasing sales in physical stores and increasing Internet sales, designating a point of sale can have major financial consequences.
The report by Seth Kerstein of the Legislative Analyst’s Office calculates that $140 million in rebates flowed from local governments to sellers in the 2023-24 fiscal year, with the largest shares going to Internet sellers and companies that provide fuel to airlines and other transportation entities.
Kerstein could calculate the total because a 2024 law Newsom signed requires disclosure of local rebate agreements. Newsom in 2019 vetoed a bill that would have imposed more restrictions on those agreements.
So are tax rebates just mutually beneficial business deals, unsavory kickbacks or legal extortion? It’s a fine line.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/070225-Newsom-Film-Industry-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

The Alabama Department of Education is considering adding a WorkKeys test as part of its College and Career Readiness Assessments. (File)The Alabama State Department of Education is considering applying for a waiver that would change the way high school students are considered prepared for college and work.
The waiver from the federal Department of Education would ensure career readiness is treated with the same level of importance as college readiness, according to Ann Jackson, chair of the Accountability Work Group, a committee of educators and education representatives across the state who have been meeting to discuss ways to restructure Alabama’s high school accountability measures.
“There seems to be a willingness to look at the current assessments that we are giving nationwide and maybe giving some waivers to some opportunities that may have been on the table before but have not been allowed,” Jackson told state board of education members last week.

Under this new accountability system, all students would still take the ACT, but those who do not show proficiency on the ACT would take the WorkKeys test instead. WorkKeys assesses workforce readiness in applied mathematics, workplace documents and graphic literacy, while the ACT measures college readiness in English, reading science and math.
“Currently, you’re only getting the proficiency piece if they’re ready for college, and we feel like our job is to have them prepared for success, even if that’s going straight into the workforce and that’s what WorkKeys would measure,” said Tony Willis, co-chair of the Accountability Work Group.
District 2 Representative Tracie West had concerns over the WorkKeys test.
“One of the comments I’ve received from the field is that the test may not be as rigorous as it could be for our students to really be prepared if they were going to enter the workforce or if they were going through a dual enrollment program,” West said.
District 1 Representative Jackie Zeigler said the WorkKeys is adequate at helping prepare students for the workforce.
“I’ve been in enough of the parts where they’re doing the welding and that math is very complicated,” Zeigler said. “I needed more of my fingers than I have in a long time. So, I don’t want to diminish the work that our kids going into the career end are not as bright. They are just choosing a different path.”
If Alabama is granted the waiver to do this mixed testing option, it would be the first state to implement it.
“We would be the first state to have a mixed delivery system but there’s about a dozen others that are waiting to see what Alabama does because we were the first state to adopt ACT as our state assessment,” Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said.
Alabama named ACT as the state assessment in 2014.
Mackey pointed out to the board members that because the waiver requires all students to take the same test, it could result in some students trying on one of the assessments but not the other.
“We used to require the WorkKeys, it wasn’t a part of the accountability, but it was a part of the assessment plan. And we got a lot of pushback that there were a lot of students who had no intention to do anything but go straight to college and that they felt like the WorkKeys wasn’t valuable to them,” Mackey told the board.
High school students would take both tests during their junior year to give the board time to add results to the state report card.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/testing-1024x665.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 08:57:02.762582

(Photo: John Partipilo)A pipeline supplying water from the Cumberland River to the fast-growing Maury and Williamson counties is feasible, but it could cost up to $1.9 billion in 2025 dollars, according to a feasibility study released this week by the Mallory Valley Utility District.
The study examined the projected costs, needs and construction timeline for approximately 30 miles of pipeline that would connect the Harpeth Valley Utilities District, which draws its water from the Cumberland, to the water utility in Columbia by 2033.
The pipeline is one of several pathways under consideration to provide reliable, long-term water supply for southern Middle Tennessee. More than 250,000 residents in the area are currently served by water withdrawn from the Duck River, the most biologically diverse freshwater river in North America. Recent bouts of drought paired with growing water needs for an expanding population and industrial developments are ramping up pressure on the Duck and the dozens of species it supports.
Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in November creating the Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership — a panel of state and local officials, utility representatives, and conservation group leaders — to explore ways to balance the river’s preservation and drought management with the region’s increasing water needs.
The partnership met Thursday and is expected to meet again on Nov. 4 before releasing its first interim report on Nov. 20. The partnership’s final report and recommendations are expected in December 2026.
TDEC: $100M Duck River budget ask could be used toward regional Tennessee River pipeline

The feasibility study began in March and was funded by the Mallory Valley Utility District, Maury County Water System, City of Mt. Pleasant Water Department, Columbia Power and Water Systems, and the City of Spring Hill.
Projected costs and hurdles
The study presents estimates for two alternatives: one 54-inch steel pipeline or two 42-inch steel pipelines (which, though more expensive, builds in redundancy in the case of interruptions). The pipeline would require two pump stations capable of moving up to 60 million gallons of water per day.
The pipeline would be built either within or near existing Tennessee Valley Authority property easements. While it would impact around 200 properties, no residents or businesses would be displaced, the study states.
The total estimated cost for the new infrastructure is between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, according to the study. 
The study did not provide specific estimates for the cost of the pipeline to ratepayers. The Harpeth Valley Utilities District, which would treat and deliver water to the pipeline, reported that it was not able to estimate its service charges until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completes its study of the Cumberland River Basin in 2026. 
Operation and maintenance of the pipeline would cost an estimated $6.2 million for the first year of operation if the pipeline initially provided 35 million gallons of water per day. The pipeline would be designed to serve up to 60 million gallons of water per day. 
Depreciation costs, or the amount charged per year to amass funds for eventual replacement, would run between $11.2 million and $17.2 million per year, depending on the pipeline option selected and assumed lifespans of 80 versus 100 years.
The estimated costs, which would be covered by each of the utilities in proportion to their demand, could be decreased if the project’s stakeholders seek state or federal grants.
The study estimates a total cost per thousand gallons at $12.08 “for illustrative purposes only,” assuming that the project costs $2 billion (with a 30-year bond at 3% financing and no state or federal support), serves 35 million gallons each day, and the Harpeth Valley Utilities District’s charges were consistent with their current rates.
For the project to be viable, it would need to obtain authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to withdraw water from the Cumberland River. It would also need to secure permitting approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, USACE, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation.
Funding may be bottom line for Spring Hill
The pipeline proposal is one of several regionalization options under scrutiny. Others include raising the Normandy Dam, increasing intake from the Duck River, or creating a system of reservoirs.
Group seeking to build Columbia Dam on Duck River teams with Ogles to pursue federal funds for study

At a Spring Hill Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting on Monday, Spring Hill Water General Manager and Assistant City Administrator Dan Allen cautioned city leaders that many conversations will happen in the next few months, and the city’s posture should be one of collaboration to find “environmentally responsible as well as fiscally sustainable solutions.”
 “It certainly appears to be a feasible project in terms of technical feasibility … the challenge that we see is primarily a funding discussion,” Allen said.
Spring Hill, which contributed funding for the feasibility study, would take about 40% to 45% of the water available in the pipeline, and could thus be responsible for the same proportion of costs, he added.
“Even at $1.7 billion, a 40-45% amount of that … I don’t believe is feasible for our ratepayers. This is where you have to start having a conversation about state assistance as well as federal assistance,” Allen said.
Jason Gilliam, one of the leaders of Columbia Dam Now, a group supporting the reconstruction of the dam on the Duck River, called the pipeline project “ridiculous” at the group’s most recent meeting on Tuesday. The cost, he said, would be too high.
The group reported in July that it is working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles to secure congressional funding to fast-track a feasibility study for rebuilding the dam. The initial effort to build the dam that started in the 1960s ran into multiple snags ranging from environmental concerns to ballooning costs to permitting issues and a flawed cost-benefit analysis, according to a Congressional report published in 1980. The dam was eventually dismantled.
It’s not clear what the construction of a similar dam would cost in today’s dollars.
In a statement to Tennessee Lookout on Thursday, Gilliam wrote that while the process is slow, there is a “concerted effort” to secure congressional funding for a Columbia Dam feasibility study by the end of the year.

America had done it! Our astronauts were the first to walk on the moon’s surface.
It wasn’t until I was elected to represent Missouri in Congress that I more fully appreciated the generational impact “winning the space race” had on America’s global influence and national security.
Neil Armstrong’s “one small step” highlighted the critical connection between significant advances in science and technology and our national security. Only by harnessing these innovations did we ensure that this new space frontier would be led by Americans instead of the Soviets. In the decades following the moon landing, America enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and national security, which eventually culminated in our victory in the Cold War.
Headlines today echo those in the 1960’s. This time our national security and prosperity are threatened by another global foe — the People’s Republic of China — and they are attempting to harness technological advances to reshape the world in their image.
Instead of space, this new race is taking place in the digital world of artificial intelligence, or AI. Simply put, if we allow China to overtake America as the world’s leader in AI, it could create insecurity for our fellow citizens for decades to come.
What will fuel our nation’s AI dominance is our ability to efficiently and effectively ramp up construction of American data centers, including the massive amounts of energy it takes to run them.
For the past three years, China has invested billions to be an AI superpower in hopes of catching up to the U.S. Consequently, a lack of data center development here in America’s heartland would be a disaster and play right into their hands.
As part of the White House’s American AI Action Plan, President Donald Trump has chartered a course for America to cement our dominance in artificial intelligence. A July executive order will cut federal red tape and streamline permitting to fast-track construction of U.S. data centers.
According to the Trump administration, winning the AI race represents the “cornerstone of innovation, powering a new age of American leadership in science, technology, and global influence.”
Over the next year or two many of the decisions on where this new high-tech industry will invest, create jobs and grow are being made.
Why shouldn’t northeast, central or southeast Missouri play a major role in powering the national AI race?
In addition to a well-trained and eager workforce, the eastern side of the Show-Me State is home to some of the most affordable electricity in the country — including rates 29% lower than the national average.
A proactive effort to site and build data centers will complement the recent push to make the St. Louis region a defense tech hub. The National Geospatial Lab is set to open next year and the White House recently announced that the next-generation F-47 fighter jets will be built in St. Louis by Boeing.
I applaud policymakers in Jefferson City who are doing their part to implement this AI Action Plan here in Missouri.
Gov. Mike Kehoe signed legislation in April that will enable Missouri to generate more home-grown electricity, including next-generation nuclear power. The new state law directs energy producers to create user-friendly policies for large data center customers and ensures that utilities pay their fair share of service costs. This forward-thinking legislation is a strong signal that Missouri is open for business and our grid will continue to have the capacity to serve businesses and homes in our local communities, including data centers.
These efforts have quickly attracted new data center opportunities. In fact, the St. Louis region is on the cusp of being the possible home to several major data centers. These projects would be among the largest construction projects in Missouri’s history, creating jobs and growing our economy. In these scenarios, local communities win because of the significant tax revenues data centers will generate, including millions of dollars in property taxes.
Putting Missouri on the map as a national leader is exciting and important.
But we need to do it strategically ensuring (1) American data centers are sited in appropriate locations and (2) local communities where the centers are located get answers to all legitimate questions about the projects. The recent pause on a St. Charles-area data center was a good example that transparency and communication about these transformational developments cannot be shortchanged.
Winning the AI race against China will not be easy. Many states and locales will allow the forces of status quo and NIMBY to prevail and lose out on these cutting-edge opportunities. But other communities which embrace these high-tech investments are likely to reverse decades of lost manufacturing jobs and witness positive economic and population growth.
Imagine a scenario — in rural Missouri or downtown St. Louis — where the “jobs of the future” exist. Young professionals and jobseekers won’t need to leave Missouri in search of a career but can instead stay, raise families and help their own local communities grow and thrive.
And while all of this is being accomplished at a local level, we have the added significant benefit of enhancing our national security and standing in the world. This is our new moonshot—another “giant leap” for American leadership.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1477933017-scaled-1-e1758208585659-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

It spans 468 acres, with the Capitol grounds covering 143 of those. Overall, the complex has 30 buildings, ranging from the domed Legislative Building, where state lawmakers and the governor transact the business of governing, to a licensed childcare center.
There are three gardens, more than a dozen monuments, five parks, plus the Tivoli Fountain. Around 400,000 people visit each year and, as of July, the state Department of Enterprise Services has permitted over 500 events on campus this year. The biggest, Capital Lakefair, attracted 15,000 attendees in July.
While there’s much to keep tabs on, security around the Capitol is increasingly stretched. 
That’s because earlier this year, to help balance the budget, the Legislature and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed off on spending reductions that gutted funding for security staff, including a contract with Washington State Patrol. 


A dash for cash 
Ahead of the 2026 legislative session, we’re highlighting budget requests from state agencies. Do you know of a notable ask? Or are you curious about a specific agency? Email us with tips or questions: info@washingtonstatestandard.com. You can check out all of the requests here.
PREVIOUSLY: Plan for new juvenile detention center in Pierce County pitched for next WA budget


Looking toward 2026, the agency that oversees the campus is looking to reverse these cuts.
The cuts “effectively eliminated” the Security Operations Center, whose employees work round-the-clock monitoring more than 800 cameras and 1,000 access control points, and the Public Safety Compliance Team, who are trained in crisis de-escalation and the first contact for noncriminal issues. A leaner contract means the state patrol’s visible presence will lessen.
The Department of Enterprise Services wants Ferguson to restore roughly $3 million in funding in the 2026 supplemental budget that he will propose in December.
As is,  this year’s reductions “will leave the campus unprotected and vulnerable outside of normal business hours, including weekends and holidays,” agency officials wrote in their budget request.
The Washington State Patrol, in concert with the public safety team and Security Operations Center services, has been able to “detect criminal behavior before it happens, or early on, and respond to incidents swiftly.”
Without the funding, security operations “would shift from preventative to reactive, meaning law enforcement response would take place after the damage is done to public safety, state employees, or state assets. Lower staffing levels create officer safety concerns, especially during times of civil unrest, contentious situations, or active shooters/threats.”
A 2019 study found Washington had the fewest law enforcement resources in the country for its state capitol complex. And the request notes this year’s cuts come as political activism on the campus is rising.
Permitted and non­permitted events increased 158% in the first six months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, according to the agency. “We expect the number of events and crowd sizes to continue increasing given ongoing federal and global issues,” reads the request.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3557-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

A few times a year, I like to focus on the array of communities, attractions and events the state has to offer. And I have some great ones for you today.
Downtown Nashville has the best fall shopping in the state. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The first is Huber’s Orchard and Winery in southern Indiana. I visited for the first time recently and was so impressed with the number of great things to do there. You can pick apples, berries and pumpkins with your kids; grab a tasty slice of pizza; enjoy a scoop of ice cream; or take a tour of the winery and distillery — while getting some free samples.
The farm market has fresh produce and sometimes there is live music on the patio. And there’s a park for kids to run around and play.
Next up, a football game. Obviously, the University of Notre Dame gets a lot of attention, and its campus and facility is full of tradition. Indiana University is also on a roll, so Bloomington would be a good stop. But honestly, any college football game around the state on a perfect fall day is worth your time. And the Indianapolis Colts stadium is also a great stop — though don’t count on the roof being open even on the nicest days.
Brown County State Park is a treasure. Nicknamed the “Little Smokies” because of the area’s resemblance to the Great Smoky Mountains, Brown County encompasses nearly 16,000 acres of rugged hills, ridges, and fog-shrouded ravines, according to the Department of Natural Resources. This is the best place to enjoy fall foliage. Axios Indianapolis reported that leaves in central and southern Indiana will achieve peak fall color between Oct. 21 and Oct. 28. And while you are in Brown County, be sure to do some early Christmas shopping in Nashville — my favorite browsing and buying spot in the state.

My husband introduced me to the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival 20 years ago and I have been going ever since. It runs Oct. 10-19 this year. Everyone knows about the crafts, art, antiques and flea markets in Bridgeton, Rockville and Mansfield. And I enjoy those along with yummy food. But I encourage everyone to explore the festival’s namesakes by picking a bridge route and driving it. The Blue Route is my favorite.
The weekend before that, Oct. 3-5, is another tradition – the Newport Antique Auto Hill Climb. If you like antique cars, it’s the place to be. More than 100,000 people come to see hundreds of automobiles, trucks and motorcycles from the steam, brass, vintage, antique, and classic car eras make timed runs. They go from a standing start up a steep hill to a finish line 1,800 feet away. You don’t want to miss the Sunday finale of the modified division, where I will be rooting on my husband.
No fall calendar would be complete without picking a pumpkin. Every corner of the state has great options for this. Visit Indiana has a fall bucket list with a number of great pumpkin patches no matter where you live.
These are just a few of the ways to celebrate fall this year. I’ll also be buying mums and enjoying time with family around the fire pit. See you there!

Mike Braun's teacher licensure threat goes too far. (Getty Images)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun warned Wednesday that teachers who post online in celebration of political violence could face suspension or even revocation of their professional licenses. But free speech advocates quickly raised concerns that the governor’s threat risks trampling constitutional protections and chilling lawful speech.
“Teachers play a critical role in the shaping of our youth,” Braun wrote in a post to X. “As a result, we hold them to a higher standard. The vast majority of Indiana’s educators live up to that standard; but sadly, in recent days a few have not.”
Braun’s comments followed the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist who was killed at a college speaking event in Utah last week. The Republican governor said disagreement on political issues “should never lead to the type of horrific tragedy we witnessed last week.”

“There have been some terrible things shared, particularly across social media,” Braun wrote, referring to online discourse about Kirk’s death. “While we must protect the First Amendment, calls for political violence are not freedom of speech and should not be tolerated.”
Braun emphasized that Indiana’s Secretary of Education “has the authority to suspend or revoke a license for misconduct and the office will review reported statements of K-12 teachers and administrators who have made statements to celebrate or incite political violence.”
David Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech, said that threat raises “serious” constitutional concerns. 
“My initial reaction was, I don’t understand why he would call for suspending, like revoking, a teacher’s license,” Keating said. He noted that Indiana law typically ties license revocations to criminal acts or serious misconduct.
State and school officials “would be totally justified, in many situations,” to cancel a teacher’s contract, Keating added, “but I just think it’s a tougher thing to go and revoke a license.”
He also pushed back on Braun’s claim that “calls for political violence are not freedom of speech.” 
“That’s actually not true,” Keating said. “You are allowed to call for violent overthrow of the government. You’re allowed to even call for assassinations. Obviously, this is not the sort of thing that you want an elementary school teacher to have in their background. But I don’t think it meets the standards for a license revocation.”
Licenses under review?
It remains unclear whether any licensure reviews are already underway in Indiana, however. 
The Indiana Department of Education — helmed by Secretary of Education Katie Jenner — “does not comment on open investigations or during the pendency of administrative proceedings,” said agency spokesperson Courtney Bearsch in a Thursday statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“IDOE is aware of social media comments made by a small number of Indiana educators following the assassination of Charlie Kirk and is reviewing each matter accordingly,” Bearsch said. “These isolated comments do not represent Indiana educators as a whole, the vast majority of which hold themselves to the highest professional standards and work diligently to model good citizenship.”
She explained that — upon being notified of a complaint against an educator — IDOE “investigates to determine whether the facts meet the statutory threshold for suspension or revocation.”
If the facts are “sufficient to satisfy statute,” a formal complaint is then filed with the Office of Administrative Law Proceedings, initiating the administrative process. Under state statute, OALP serves as the final administrative authority in issuing an order on an educator’s license.
IDOE maintains a public database of educators who have been disciplined, most often for criminal convictions. As of Thursday, no license suspensions or revocations had been recorded in the database since Aug. 25.

At least 25 licenses have been revoked since Jan. 1 — most of which were for offenses by educators and school employees who were convicted of one or more of 37 serious felonies that are listed in state statute. Conviction is automatic grounds for a license to be revoked.
Aside from criminal offenses, seven educator licenses were revoked since the start of the year for “immorality” and one for “misconduct,” according to IDOE.
There are more than 230,000 licensed teachers in the state of Indiana.
Stevie Pactor, an attorney with the ACLU of Indiana, warned that Braun’s threat could have broad implications for teachers’ speech.
“Teachers still have First Amendment rights when they’re talking as private citizens about matters of public concern on their social media or anywhere else,” Pactor said. “This idea of chilling their speech is absolutely where my mind went to.”
She pointed to a line from a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which asserted that “The First Amendment needs breathing space to survive.”
“If I were a K-12 educator, I would absolutely be very, very cognizant of what I was putting on social media in this climate, and to a degree that’s not really justified by what the law allows,” Pactor continued. “These posts are clearly their private speech. There’s no question that this is private speech.”
Indiana’s Constitution also has its own speech protections: “No law shall be passed, restraining the free interchange of thought and opinion, or restricting the right to speak, write, or print, freely, on any subject whatever; but for the abuse of that right, every person shall be responsible.”
What the law says — and what’s less clear
Indiana law gives state education officials authority to suspend or revoke a teacher’s license under limited circumstances. 
The Department of Education is permitted by statute to take such action “upon the written recommendation of the state superintendent of public instruction” if a teacher is found guilty of “(1) immorality; (2) misconduct in office; (3) incompetency; or (4) willful neglect of duty.” 
But because “immorality” is not defined in state code, how it applies to off-duty speech — especially speech on personal social media accounts — is open to interpretation, Keating said.
He cautioned that even the governor’s public threat could have consequences. 
“Teachers face this kind of pressure for actually bringing up real issues of public concern,” he said, noting that off-duty speech cases are highly fact-specific and courts have often deferred to school districts. “Taking away their license — I mean, you look at the other standards for taking people’s licenses away. Those are by and large criminal convictions.”
DCS worker out amid other fallout from Kirk assassination

The free speech expert noted, too, that the legal definition of incitement requires more than offensive online rhetoric. 
“Some random person posting on social media — just for whoever out there might or might not be reading it — that’s not incitement,” Keating added, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brandenburg test, which limits punishable incitement to speech likely to produce imminent lawless action.
State law also spells out what qualifies as “official misconduct.” According to Indiana Code, a public servant commits official misconduct if they knowingly or intentionally commit an offense while performing their official duties; solicit or accept unauthorized property in connection with their work; misuse nonpublic information for personal gain; or fail to turn over public records or property to a successor. The statute classifies the offense as a Level 6 felony.
Administrative rules also provide more detail on how the license review process works. 
Under Indiana’s Administrative Code, a license suspension can last up to three years, while a revocation can extend for an indeterminate period. A teacher whose license is revoked has the ability to petition for reinstatement after three years.
State officials are required to consider several factors when reviewing a case or a reinstatement petition. 
Those include whether the conduct adversely affected students or colleagues; how long ago the conduct occurred; whether the conduct is likely to recur; and whether denying reinstatement could “chill constitutional rights.” Officials are also directed to weigh evidence of rehabilitation, such as counseling or community service.
Proceedings to suspend or revoke a license are subject to public hearings and can take months or years to resolve.










If I were a K-12 educator, I would absolutely be very, very cognizant of what I was putting on social media in this climate, and to a degree that's not really justified by what the law allows.


– Stevie Pactor, ACLU of Indiana attorney


Pactor underscored that the threshold for punishing speech is high. 
“The school district, in order to prohibit or punish a teacher for their speech, can only do that if that speech would cause a significant disruption to the learning environment or impair the effective operation of the school or the school district,” she said. “And that’s a really high standard.”
She stressed that licensing actions face the same constitutional constraints as school discipline. 
“All government action is subject to the same standard,” Pactor noted. “You know where the First Amendment says you’ve got to stop.”
If the state proceeds with discipline, Pactor said litigation is likely.
“I would certainly expect it to be challenged in court,” she said. “And of course, if any impacted government employee, including educators, believe that their First Amendment rights have been violated in any of these circumstances, they should absolutely contact us.”
A wave of scrutiny
Braun’s threat comes as other educators and public employees have already faced consequences for social media posts about Kirk’s killing.
Indiana’s Department of Child Services, for example, announced via social media on Sept. 13 that a worker was no longer with the agency after making a comment that was in poor taste and “does not reflect the values of this agency or the standards that have been set by this administration.” The agency later confirmed the employee resigned.
Since then, at Ball State University, a director of health promotion and advocacy was fired Wednesday after writing on Facebook that Kirk’s death “is a reflection of the violence, fear and hatred he sowed. It does not excuse his death, AND it’s a sad truth.”

The university said the statement was “inconsistent with the distinctive nature and trust” of her leadership role and had caused “significant disruption” on campus.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Todd Rokita has directed his office to investigate similar statements made by K-12 teachers. His “Eyes on Education” online portal — a site already used to collect complaints about schools — now features a section highlighting social media posts by educators that appear to justify or celebrate Kirk’s death.
Among those listed as of Thursday was a Riley High School teacher in South Bend, who allegedly wrote on Facebook, “I’m not saying it’s right, but I’m saying it’s only fitting.” 
An Elkhart teacher was also flagged, prompting Elkhart Community Schools to circulate a letter reminding staff that online speech can significantly affect how the community views both individuals and the district.
The Indiana State Teachers Association condemned violence but warned Braun’s threat could chill lawful speech. 
“ISTA condemns violence in all forms, including political violence. Indiana’s educators devote their lives to creating safe and welcoming classrooms, and the vast majority do so with professionalism, care and deep commitment to their students every day,” the state’s largest teachers union said in a statement Thursday. “While celebrating violence is unacceptable, threatening educators’ licenses for lawful speech risks silencing those who are teaching honestly or sharing personal views responsibly. … Political violence threatens our democracy, but so does censorship.”

Advoc[...]","The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development headquarters. (Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)A federal housing program for families exiting homelessness awarded $5.2 million to a nonprofit Twin Cities housing developer for two projects, but the money never came through. 
Instead, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rewrote the program guidelines, re-issued the funding application, and gave applicants just one week to re-apply. Advocates sued, arguing that the new guidelines disqualify all projects in jurisdictions with policies — on immigration, homelessness, harm reduction and transgender acceptance — that do not align with Trump administration policy.
A federal judge issued an order temporarily blocking HUD from enforcing the new policies. 
But Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative, a nonprofit developer of permanent supportive housing, says it never received the $5.2 million it was promised.
The situation underscores the whiplash being felt by many organizations, from food banks to child care providers, that have had crucial federal funding withheld since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. 
The money was awarded to two projects that have yet to break ground: Gladstone Crossing in Maplewood, which will create 40 units of supportive housing for families experiencing homelessness; and Aster Commons in Richfield, which will have 38 apartments for young adults who have experienced homelessness, especially those with autism, mental illness or other conditions. 
Supportive housing developments offer deeply affordable — sometimes free — rental housing to people transitioning out of homelessness. They include on-site services, like case management, mental health treatment and job training. Supportive housing is the “invisible backbone of our community solutions on homelessness,” said Chris LaTondresse, president and CEO of Beacon Interfaith Housing Collaborative.
The Biden administration invested billions into anti-homelessness initiatives — including $175 million in supportive housing development, via HUD’s Continuum of Care program — as pandemic protections for renters expired and homelessness increased. The Biden-led HUD also encouraged the “housing first” approach to homelessness, which does not require sobriety or participation in a substance abuse treatment program as a condition of receiving free or subsidized housing, with the idea that people are more likely to seek treatment — and easier to reach — if they are in stable housing. 
In May, HUD opened up applications for Continuum of Care grants totaling $75 million. Ramsey and Hennepin county offices applied for grants to go towards the two Beacon supportive housing developments. In August, HUD started notifying members of Congress about the grant recipients, according to a complaint filed by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. 
Beacon learned from Sen. Tina Smith that they had been awarded $5.2 million in grants for the two projects.
But HUD never wrote the checks. 
In September, the agency launched a new round of Continuum of Care grant applications, superseding the previous round. It contained a host of new requirements, many of them ideologically aligned with the Trump administration. It also narrowed the focus of the program, requiring projects to be focused on the elderly or people with physical disabilities. 
To receive grants under the rewritten program, projects must be in a city, county and state that prohibit public camping, drug use and squatting and enforces those prohibitions; cooperates with Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and follows certain standards for involuntary commitment. 
It also bars applicants who “deny the sex binary in humans or promote the notion that sex is a chosen or mutable characteristic” and those who “knowingly distribute drug paraphenelia…under the pretext of ‘harm reduction.’”
Minnesota doesn’t qualify under several of the provisions. For instance, Minnesota is a trans refuge state and many local law enforcement jurisdictions do not enforce federal immigration law, which is considered a federal, not a state or local responsibility. 
The department gave applicants one week to submit the new forms.
“Beacon earned this funding through a rigorous, competitive process, and then HUD ripped it away to serve Trump’s agenda. Minnesota families and young people were promised this housing, and now Trump has taken it away from them,” Smith said.
Affordable housing projects are financed through a mishmash of public and private funding sources — tax credits, grants, private donations, lenders, investors — each with its own deadlines and contingencies. Developers have to source funding for both the construction of the project and the ongoing expenses, like operations and maintenance. Continuum of Care grants helped with both. 
When one piece of the funding puzzle falls through, it can throw others into question. 
“The loss of these awards represents a setback for both projects, and we are actively assessing the path forward to closing on both,” LaTrondresse said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/51668526145_e737307647_o-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

New Jersey health officials have proposed rules to license and regulate facilities that store frozen embryos and eggs. (Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images)State health officials are moving to regulate egg and embryo storage in New Jersey, an effort to protect frozen reproductive tissues from facility failures that could ruin them.
The state Department of Health has proposed new “biobanking compliance” rules that would require cryopreservation facilities that store eggs and embryos to be licensed and establish standards for premises, equipment, recordkeeping, adverse event reporting, emergency preparedness, and quality management, among other things. Violators would face fines and license suspension, revocation, or renewal refusal.
New Jersey legislators ordered the regulations in a 2019 law in response to catastrophic 2018 failures of such facilities in Ohio and California that resulted in the loss of thousands of embryos and eggs that were stored for people who rely on in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technology to start or expand their families.
The law, signed in December 2019, was required to be enacted by February 2021. But the pandemic sidetracked health officials and derailed implementation until now, said Claudia Trani-Melgar, a department spokeswoman.
Trani-Melgar said the regulations would ensure such facilities operate safely and effectively, certify that they’re prepared for emergencies and natural disasters, and decrease the likelihood of avoidable equipment failures.
“As a result, individuals and couples that utilize assisted reproductive technology will have greater confidence in the integrity of stored reproductive tissue and its availability for their future use or benefit,” Trani-Melgar said. “We are setting a gold standard that will give families peace of mind and serve as a model for states across the country.”
The rulemaking comes as states around the country are scrambling to regulate in this space, with the Trump administration increasingly restricting reproductive rights, said Jessie Losch, director of government affairs for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
In February, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to expand access to in vitro fertilization and gave White House officials 90 days to draft policy recommendations. But the administration has since backpedaled and seemingly abandoned the issue.
Still, that order created uncertainty and further fueled the “personhood” movement, presenting new challenges for embryo storage facilities and IVF providers, Losch noted.
Policymakers on all sides of the issue have acted. At least 17 states now have protections in place establishing fetal rights, according to the nonprofit Pregnancy Justice. Democratic-leaning states, including Rhode Island and Colorado, have followed New Jersey’s lead and are considering or have passed laws to license and regulate facilities that handle embryos, Losch said. Other states are eyeing regulations on everything from how frozen embryos should be disposed of to how long they can be stored.
Embryo and egg storage is already subject to several layers of federal oversight by agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Losch said. But she welcomed state oversight too, at least now.
“We tend to say more regulation is not needed as long as you’re in compliance with existing regulations, but I think a lot of norms have flown out the window,” Losch said.
State policymakers likely will have to consider the interstate implications of egg and embryo storage too, much as New Jersey legislators acted to protect patients and providers from criminal and civil liability for getting or performing abortions in states where the procedure is restricted, Losch said.
“They may look at our existing shield law to see how that can protect shipping embryos or gametes into and out of the state,” she said. “Where states are trying to protect access (to reproductive rights), New Jersey has been leading the way.”
The Department of Health is accepting written public comment on the proposed rules on egg and embryo storage until Nov. 14. Comments can be filed online or by mail to Kimberly E. Jenkins, director of the Office of Legal and Regulatory Compliance, New Jersey Department of Health, PO Box 360, Trenton, NJ 08625-0360.

But legislators created a second one.,"PETAL — Preschoolers kneel on a kaleidoscope rug, their clumsy hands reaching for wooden blocks, little socked feet tucked underneath.
Block by block, they build a tower that only teeters a little, and for a moment, stands tall. The kids grin proudly. And when it tumbles to the ground a few seconds later, the classroom corner is filled with the sound of giggles.
A bystander might think this is just play. But the teacher watching nearby knows they’re learning essential fine-motor skills. They’re also learning social skills by sharing with their classmates. 
Thanks to a statewide investment in early education more than a decade ago, about one in six Mississippi children is learning these integral skills within the first few years of life at “early learning collaboratives” throughout the state. Experts agree the program is directly connected to the state’s reading gains that have garnered national attention. 
So when lawmakers created another state-funded pre-K program in 2022, some wondered: Why do we need both? One legislative leader who helped create the collaboratives is concerned the new program might siphon away resources, or recreate some of the problems the state faced for decades with early learning.
Early learning collaboratives, a state and taxpayer funded pre-K program established by the Legislature in 2013, created education partnerships in communities across Mississippi. The program has high academic standards, and it brings together child-care centers, nonprofit organizations, school districts and Head Start agencies. It compensates the groups for partnering. 
In 2021, just 18 collaboratives were serving about 3,000 4-year-olds throughout the state, but the program still landed Mississippi top marks for early education from a national research group.

Four years later, that count has more than doubled. Now, 40 collaboratives across Mississippi have more than 6,000 kids enrolled. 
But a new program, called the state-invested pre-K program, or SIP, doesn’t require collaboration with Head Start centers, which provide a myriad of services beyond education for some of the state’s neediest children. Additionally, because of the way the program is set up, there’s less red tape.
For those reasons, it may be a more appealing option for underfunded districts looking to make their dollars go further. It’s frustrating for Sen. Brice Wiggins, a Republican from Pascagoula, who championed the original program that required collaboration among pre-K partners, instead of fighting over students and the money that follows them.
“As I understand it, the SIP program has its roots in something that has always plagued early education in Mississippi,” he said. “Competition.” 
‘Skin in the game’
There was an old saying among the police officers and prosecutors in Jackson County, Wiggins remembers from his time working in the district attorney’s office. 
“They said they determined the amount of prison beds by how well kids performed in the third and fourth grade,” he recalled, in his office at the state Capitol in June. “That resonated.”
When he was elected to the state Senate, those kids were fresh on his mind.
Wiggins spent 2012, his first year at the Capitol, advocating for early childhood education and began working up a plan to reshape the state’s system with policy researcher Rachel Canter. They partnered with then-Republican Rep. Toby Barker, who is now an independent and serves as mayor of Hattiesburg. By the time the next year rolled around — 2013, a seminal year for education in Mississippi — Wiggins thought he had something good.

As lawmakers were working up what would become the literacy act that fundamentally changed reading education in Mississippi, leaders in the Legislature were signing off on Wiggins’ early education plan. It addressed the “patchwork of pre-kindergarten entities” in Mississippi and the lack of coordination between them. When students enroll in different pre-K programs, money follows — tuition at private day-care facilities or federal funding at Head Start are two examples. The collaboratives had a goal of eliminating the infighting that happens in communities over 4-year-olds by giving stakeholders a financial incentive to work together.
The bill passed by a vast bipartisan majority in 2013 and lawmakers appropriated $3 million for it. The Mississippi Department of Education selected 11 communities to host the first collaboratives.
In a collaborative, there’s a lead partner — usually the local school district, but it can be a nonprofit organization — that has local responsibility over the program. They’re in charge of disbursing funds, facilitating professional development and ensuring everyone is adhering to standards. 
Those standards are rigorous. The bill requires collaboratives to use a curriculum that aligns with benchmarks from the National Institute of Early Education Research. This includes having teachers with bachelor’s degrees and at least 15 hours of professional development a year.
The collaborative’s lead partner is required to work with other local pre-kindergarten providers such as child care and Head Start centers to be eligible for the collaborative and its funding, which was originally $2,150 per student (That amount has since increased to $5,000). But the costs quickly add up. The $3 million from the Legislature got them started The state agreed to pay half of each student’s education costs. The rest had to come from the communities. 
Enter the part that Wiggins is most proud of: To make up the other half, the Legislature created a tax-credit program. That means businesses and individuals can donate to their local collaborative and receive a dollar-for-dollar credit on their taxes. 
“That created some skin in the game,” he said.

Setting students up for success
Deanna Hathorn holds open a book at the front of the classroom, and every face is turned toward her. 
“‘Justin dreamt that he could fly,’” she reads in a lilting voice. 
Then Hathorn directs her students: “Hold one finger up if you have dreams!”
Immediately, tiny index fingers fly into the air.
Petal, a suburb of Hattiesburg, was one of the first communities to opt into the early learning collaborative program. 
Prior to the program, it was relatively common for Petal students to enter kindergarten without any classroom education because options were limited to Head Start and a handful of Christian-based schools, similar to many other Mississippi towns, according Jana Perry. Perry is Petal’s former primary school assistant principal and the current director of the district’s Coleman Center for Children and Families, the lead partner for the Petal Early Learning Collaborative.
That’s because pre-kindergarten was not funded by the state before 2013. 
“The act was a game-changer,” she said. “If we didn’t have this, we would be so far behind. Why we are doing so well as a state is because of early childhood education.” 
Wiggins said Petal is one of the state’s most successful early learning collaboratives, in its reach and academic achievement. About 300 kids in Petal enter the district’s kindergarten program every year. Most will have gone through the collaborative, which currently has 179 students across 10 classrooms at five sites. 
The difference between the students who have had a year in the collaborative and the ones who haven’t is stark, Perry said. 
Mississippi Department of Education data shows that collaborative students outperform their peers on the statewide kindergarten readiness assessment. That’s because the collaborative students enter kindergarten more familiar with classroom structure and the curriculum. Plus, some potential barriers to learning may have already been identified, Perry said. For example, collaborative teachers can intervene if a child has a speech impediment, potentially making a year’s worth of progress by the time that student enters kindergarten. 
“We can go ahead and get them set up to succeed once they walk in the door,” she said. “And they know how to do school. Kids who haven’t been through pre-K really struggle in their first year in kindergarten.”
The impact of early education echoes throughout a child’s life, said Steven Barnett, founder of the National Institute for Early Education Research. 
“The first thing you’ll notice is that the students do better when they get to kindergarten, and then they do better on those early grade exams,” Barnett said. “But the next thing you’ll notice is they’re less likely to fail and have to repeat. They’re less likely to need special education, and they’re going to be more likely to graduate from high school and go on to higher education.

“That’s the big payoff, because that’s where you get better health outcomes, better employment, better incomes.”
Petal superintendent Matt Dillon said the first cohort of early learning collaborative students are now in high school, and the impact of the program is tangible — in test scores, expected graduation rates and school environment. 
“This is a community that really recognized the importance of early education,” he said. “And fast forward to today, we’re reaping the benefits.”
That success of early learning collaboratives is why, when Wiggins heard about the new state-funded pre-kindergarten program created in 2022, he was confused — and, honestly, a little agitated. 
“Nobody asked me about it,” Wiggins said. “And if they had, I would have said, ‘No.’”
New program may fit smaller communities
Union, a tiny town in piney central Mississippi anchored by a couple of four-way stops, is home to about 2,000 people. Most of the town’s 4-year-olds are in three classrooms at the Union Elementary School’s campus, thanks to funding from the new SIP program. 
On the whole, it’s not dissimilar from early learning collaborative classrooms in Petal. In rainbow-decorated rooms, children take care of baby dolls, listen to stories read aloud and match letters on worksheets.
But policy differences set the two programs apart.
The SIP program, which was funded in 2022, paid schools $100,000 for each early education classroom, and an extra $25,000 each if the school partnered with its local Head Start. However, that partnership is not required. This policy was slightly changed for the newest batch of participating schools — now, if they do not partner with the local Head Start, the district receives a fraction of that money.
Additionally, while the early learning collaboratives are enshrined in and regulated by state law, the SIP program is simply a line item in the annual education appropriation bill. That means its existence is subject to the whims of legislative approval each year.
The Mississippi Department of Education works hard to make sure all participating schools are in compliance — the SIP program meets all 10 of NIEER’s quality early education benchmarks, as does the collaborative program — but the agency doesn’t have to. 
Jill Dent, the agency’s early childhood director, said in an emailed statement that the department advocates equally for both programs. 
“Our goal is to support districts in choosing the model that best fits their local needs and capacity,” she wrote. 
It’s not unusual, Barnett said, for states to have more than one early education program. But it does beg the question: Who does the SIP program serve? 
“Sometimes, one program doesn’t fit everybody,” he said. “But sometimes, it’s just politics.” 
The politics didn’t matter to longtime Union Superintendent Tyler Hansford. He just didn’t see a collaborative working for his community. It’s small, doesn’t have many child care centers and the closest Head Start — which Union does work with — is a 30-minute drive. And he’s happy with the decision he’s made, already able to see the positive impact the program is having in Union.
“We’re able to reach more students and get them in early,” he said. “What we’ve seen is that there’s tremendous benefit in that.”
Hansford saw more bang for his buck with the SIP program, along with 32 other communities across Mississippi. Perry and Barnett said they both understand why those districts have made the decision to opt into the SIP program over the collaborative program.
Some districts might not want to partner with as many entities as the collaboratives require because they’re happy with the way they do things. Others, such as Union, might not have as many resources or options in their community to support a collaborative. 
But some places that are short on money have made the collaborative structure work, such as Tallahatchie County, a tiny community in the Delta with a median household income of $23,000. 
Tallahatchie hosts one of the state’s original early learning collaboratives. The lead partner, nonprofit Tallahatchie Early Learning Alliance, brings together local Head Starts and East Tallahatchie School District and has served more than 1,000 students since the local program began in 2014. 
There were no publicly funded pre-K classrooms prior to the collaborative and only a handful of child-care centers. Only two served low-income children and they had long waitlists, said Cheryl Swoopes, director of community engagement for SonEdna, which launched Tallahatchie Early Learning Alliance. 
“With limited resources, it’s a process, but we’ve stayed the course,” she said. “We’ve had teachers and administrators tell us that they wouldn’t know what to do if TELA wasn’t here.”
Today, the Tallahatchie collaborative is the only coordinated, fully funded pre-K effort in the county, and in Wiggins’ view, if Tallahatchie can do it, anyone can. 
“The ELC, it is work,” said Perry, from Petal. “There’s a lot of work. But it’s very worth it.”
Looking ahead
Despite stagnant state test scores this year, Mississippi continues to revel in the glow of its national academic achievements, particularly in literacy and early education.
Wiggins believes those achievements are in no small part due to the collaboratives. He hopes to see the program expand to include younger students and more communities in the next 10 years. 
Access is still low, with enrollment rates of 17.7% of all Mississippi 4-year-olds. The SIP program reaches about 900 kids, or about 2.4% of 4-year-olds.  A recent report from Barnett’s organization noted that neighboring Alabama serves twice as many four-year-olds.
Neither of Mississippi’s pre-K programs serve 3-year-olds.

Since early learning collaboratives were established, funding has steadily increased. The original $3 million allotment is now up to $29 million, plus $3.25 million for the program’s coaches. 
The SIP program received $13 million in the most recent appropriations bill. 
“Our scores in kindergarten readiness continue to go up, and the nation understands what we’ve done,” Wiggins said. “But we’ve got to continue to do things. 
“We’ve got to reduce the friction in the early education world in Mississippi because it should be about the kids. We have something that works. We need to continue to support that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29120532/No-faces-1.jpg,,,2025-09-19 07:56:13.853743

A newly amended proposal from the state Department of Workforce Development (DWD) calls for repealing Wisconsin’s ban on jobless pay for people who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) income.
The proposal follows a federal court ruling that found the ban violates two federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
Until this week, however, DWD’s proposal to repeal the ban included an additional provision: While a person receiving SSDI payments would be eligible for unemployment insurance after losing a job, disability income would “offset” — cancel out — some or all of the individual’s unemployment compensation.
The SSDI proposal was one of a dozen changes to the state’s unemployment insurance law that DWD submitted to the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council earlier this year. The council, a long-standing body with equal representation from business and labor, negotiates changes to the state’s unemployment insurance laws every two years.
On Thursday, DWD submitted an amended version of its SSDI proposal. The new version repeals the ban on jobless pay for SSDI recipients and omits the offset provision.
“This is wonderful news for everyone involved and for the state of Wisconsin in general, disabled or non-disabled,” said lawyer Victor Forberger.
Forberger has specialized in representing people whose unemployment insurance claims have been rejected. He was one of the lawyers who sued DWD in federal court in 2021 to overturn the state law banning jobless pay for SSDI recipients.
Jobless pay ban violates federal law
U.S. District Judge William Conley ruled in July 2024 that the jobless pay ban violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.
Even after that ruling, DWD continued to deny unemployment claims made by people on SSDI. This July 14, Conley ordered DWD to stop disqualifying SSDI recipients from unemployment compensation.
In August, the judge ordered DWD to pay jobless benefits to eligible applicants who were denied because they received SSDI payments between Sept. 7, 2015 — when the SSDI-unemployment ban law was last revised — and July 30, 2025. Conley also ordered DWD to pay back people who had collected jobless pay but then ordered to pay back the money because they were on SSDI.
The federal Social Security Administration program allows and encourages disability insurance recipients to work part-time if they are able to.
During the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, however, DWD asserted in a  proposal that disability payment recipients who applied for unemployment insurance were probably “double-dipping” and committing “fraud.” The ban on unemployment pay for SSDI recipients was enacted in 2013, during Walker’s first term, and revised in 2015 during his second term.
DWD proposes unemployment insurance changes
Earlier this year DWD drafted 12 proposed revisions to Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance law for the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council to consider.
The department’s SSDI proposal called for repealing the ban on jobless pay, but also called for offsetting an SSDI recipient’s unemployment compensation on the basis of the disability income.
When Forberger read the DWD proposal and saw the offset provision, he wrote about it on his blog about unemployment insurance policy and wrote to the labor caucus members of the advisory council urging them not to support it.
The offset provision was still part of DWD’s SSDI repeal recommendation when the department presented its proposals to the advisory council in August.
The offset provision surprised state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) when it came to her attention. Sinicki has often scolded lawmakers when they introduce bills to change the unemployment compensation system without sending them through the joint labor-management council.
“I’ve always been a stickler for, you vote yes on the agreed-upon bill [from the advisory council] because it was a compromise between both parties,” Sinicki told the Wisconsin Examiner on Thursday. But when she learned of the offset provision, “I made it very clear that I would not vote for any bill that had that in there.”
Sinicki along with Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) have authored their own proposal to repeal the SSDI jobless pay ban after the court ordered DWD to stop enforcing it. Both said they opposed DWD’s offset proposal and that they were glad to see that the department scrapped it Thursday.
‘Discrimination. Full stop.’
“What’s happening right now is discrimination. Full stop,” Dassler-Alfheim said in a written statement to the Wisconsin Examiner. “That’s why the federal judge ruled against it, that’s why Representative Sinicki and I have proposed legislation to remove it from state statute, and I’m glad to see that DWD has put forth this amendment” removing the offset.
Three proposed budgets from Gov. Tony Evers included recommendations to end the SSDI jobless pay ban, but with an offset provision as well. Those largely went unnoticed at the time, and were removed along with hundreds of other Evers proposals by the Republican leaders of the Joint Finance Committee during budget deliberations.
It wasn’t clear Thursday what prompted DWD to remove the offset provision from its latest proposal. The department memo to the joint advisory council said that it was already complying with Conley’s order to process benefit claims for SSDI recipients and would do so for previously-denied claims without an offset.
Amending its proposed change in the law to remove the offset provision “will align with the effect of the court’s order that is now allowing claimants who receive SSDI to be eligible for the full amount of their weekly benefit without a reduction for any SSDI received,” the memo states.
Sinicki said that while she was outspoken about her opposition to the offset provision, she had not directly communicated that either to DWD or to members of the advisory council.
A spokesperson for Dassler-Alfheim said she also had not been in direct contact with DWD or the Evers administration about her opposition to the offset.

(Photo by Getty Images)Driven by “a lineup of disgraceful racial bigots and American fascists,” a divisive political crusade by conservatives in the United States was “like a gigantic, tumultuous hurricane” that “dominated the thoughts and actions of the American people, disrupting their emotions, distorting their judgment ….” Those are the words of Michigan Republican Charles E. Potter, a member of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, who, in his 1965 book “Days of Shame,” repudiated the excesses of the McCarthy era.
I read Potter’s 60-year-old mea culpa in David Maraniss’s powerful personal history, “A Good American Family: The Red Scare and My Father,” (Simon & Schuster 2019), which traces the Maraniss family’s harrowing journey to Madison, Wisconsin. The anti-McCarthy Capital Times newspaper saved Maraniss’s dad, Elliott, giving him a job after he was blacklisted and then followed from town to town by federal agents investigating his political activities over “five years, five cities, four kids, eight homes, two papers that fired him, three papers that folded,” as Maraniss writes.
I binge-read the book amid a storm of news as the administration of President Donald Trump ramped up attacks on leftwing activists, Democrats, progressive nonprofits and the media, blaming them for the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, and vowing to attack what White House adviser Stephen Miller called a “vast domestic terror movement,” using the full force of the federal government to “identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks.” 
I reached out to Maraniss Thursday in Madison, where the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author grew up and still spends summers. ABC had just indefinitely suspended late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel for criticizing the MAGA movement’s weaponization of the Kirk shooting. And Trump and his FCC chairman were threatening to yank broadcasting licenses from media outlets that criticize the president.
I wanted to ask Maraniss about the parallels he sees between the time he describes so vividly in his book and the current moment. 
“There are several obvious haunting similarities,” he told me on the phone, “the demonization of others, the calling of all opponents Marxist or communists or enemies of the state, the gross manipulation of truth, the use of fear to stifle dissent and pressure to silence the media or get the press to go along.”
“Back then,” he added, “most of the press did go along with McCarthy for a long time.”
The Capital Times stood out as an early critic of Wisconsin’s bombastic Red-hunting senator, Joseph McCarthy. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson was another prominent anti-McCarthy voice, along with Murrey Marder of the Washington Post and Edward R. Murrow — all mentioned in Maraniss’s book. “But you could cite many more that were going along with McCarthyism.”
The main difference Maraniss sees between the McCarthy era and today is that “McCarthy was only a senator, and now we’re dealing with the president, with full control of the levers of power which McCarthy did not have, ranging from the Justice Department to the military.”
McCarthy took aim at major U.S. institutions — from government agencies to  universities to Hollywood to mainline Protestant churches — but he overstepped when began attacking the U.S. Army, infuriating then-President Dwight Eisenhower. 
Another glaring difference between then and now, Maraniss added, “is that McCarthy did not have the full support of his own party, the Republican Party.” Today, “almost any Republican who opposed Trump is now no longer in office or in the party.”
It took a long time, however, for mainstream media and mainstream Republicans to turn against McCarthyism and for the public to swing from the distorted thinking former HUAC member Potter finally repudiated to the consensus that leftwing political ideology did not, in fact, pose an existential threat to U.S. national security.
Among the many echoes of Red Scare fever resonating through national politics today is the central issue of race. One of the most gripping scenes in Maraniss’s book is future Detroit Mayor Coleman Young’s testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee in the Federal Building in Detroit. Young, a World War II veteran, confronts the southern racists on the committee as they question his loyalty, repeatedly correcting their slurring pronunciation of the world “Negro.” Despite the committee’s high-handedness and multiple attempts to silence him, Young has the last word. 
“I fought in the last war and I would unhesitatingly take up arms against anybody that attacks this country,” he says. “In the same manner, I am now in the process of fighting against what I consider to be attacks and discrimination against my people. I am fighting against un-American activities such as lynchings and denial of the vote. I am dedicated to that fight and I don’t think I must apologize or explain it to anybody, my position on that.”
Reading about Young and the other brave souls who stood up to McCarthyism, including the elder Maraniss’s lawyer, George Crockett, who was jailed for contempt and returned to continue fighting, is inspiring and thrilling. 
In contrast, Maraniss traces the sordid history of U.S. Rep. John Stephens Wood, a Democrat from Georgia and chairman of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan (though he claimed he only went to one meeting). He lays out the evidence that Wood attended the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish industrialist who was accused of killing of a young, female factory worker in Georgia. Wood was the “wheelman” for Judge Newt Morris, his mentor, helping to collect the body from the lynchers and drive it to the morgue. 
White racists, as Potter later acknowledged, played a prominent role in the McCarthy era purges of “un-American” activists. These were the people who sat in judgment of civil rights leaders, Black unionists and activists for racial equality. Maraniss’s father, an antifascist who joined the Communist Party when he was in college at the University of Michigan, led an all-Black battalion in World War II, and dedicated his life to his idealistic view of America, was the target of people who had little respect for equal rights or the Constitution.
Who are the real patriots, Maraniss asks — a question that resonates today.
“Race is at the center of American life, then and now,” Maraniss said on the phone. “And what we’re facing this time is really an attempt to erase the civil rights movement.”
“The chairman of the House un American Activities Committee that went after my father was a Georgia racist who was elected in white-only primaries and opposed every civil rights measure, and he was the one defining what’s an American,” he said. “And you have a similar thing going on now where Charlie Kirk is celebrated on NFL stadium screens and people are being fired left and right, for criticizing someone who disparaged Martin Luther King.”
It’s important not to be cowed by the deliberate use of language as a weapon to promote misunderstanding, he said, “as they have with DEI. I mean, what is on its face wrong with diversity, equity and inclusion, you know? Think about it. I mean, the same thing with being antifascist. I mean, people should embrace those ideas and not run away from them.”
Of his parents, Maraniss writes: “They never betrayed America and loved it no less than the officials who rendered judgment on them in Room 740 of the Federal Building in Detroit. They were dissenters who believed the nation had not lived up to its founding ideals in terms of race and equality, largely because of the reactionary attitudes of self-righteous attackers on the American right.”

The book ends happily. The Maraniss family arrived in Wisconsin in time to watch the Milwaukee Braves play their way to a pennant and eventually beat the Yankees in the World Series. “McCarthy was dead. The Supreme Court had essentially overturned the Smith Act, ruling it was unconstitutional to bring charges against American citizens solely because of their political advocacy. … The world was opening anew.”
But there is, of course, no real end to the struggle. In an epilogue, Maraniss writes about Cap Times reporter John Patrick Hunter, who, long after the Red Scare was safely over,  typed up sections of the preamble to the Declaration of Independence, combined it with a petition listing six of the 10 amendments to the Bill of Rights, along with the Fifteenth Amendment granting Black men the right to vote, then roamed a local park in Madison trying to collect signatures. “He gave the people the nation’s foundational truth and it did not go well,” Maraniss writes. “Of the 112 people he asked to sign the petition. Only one did. Twenty accused him of being a communist.”
“It is an endless struggle,” Maraniss said on the phone. “That’s what life is. And you know, it tends to go in cycles of reaction and counter reaction.

Jackson Hole’s wild bison herd is distinct from the one in Yellowstone National Park.
The post Battle of the behemoths: Wyoming’s bison kick off the rut appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s wild bison are the first of the ungulates (hooved animals) to kick off the fall breeding season, or rut. 
For bison, the rut starts in July, but really gets going in August and carries into September. At some 2,000 pounds, bull bison are the largest land mammals in North America.
Watching these rutting behemoths battle each other, roll in the dust and incessantly chase the cows is truly an impressive sight. One might think the bison of Yellowstone and Jackson Hole are one big herd, but they’re not.

They are two distinct herds, with little interchange between them. The history of the Jackson Bison Herd is an interesting one. 
Bison were native to all of Wyoming and several surrounding states, once numbering in the hundreds of millions. The decimation of bison across their expansive range throughout the 1800s has been well documented, and by the mid 1880s they were extirpated outside Yellowstone National Park.

Jackson Hole wouldn’t see bison again until 1948 when 20 animals were brought to a fenced enclosure called the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park west of Moran Junction, near what is known today as Oxbow Bend in Grand Teton National Park. The wildlife park was also a place for visitors to see elk, moose, deer and pronghorn antelope.

The breeding season for elk, moose and pronghorn typically begins in early to mid-September and runs through October. Deer generally start in November and bighorn sheep begin in late November into December.
It is reported that the bison would regularly escape their pen each year and have to be rounded up. In 1969, park officials decided to stop trying to round up the escapees and thus began the modern day free-ranging wild bison herd in Jackson Hole.
In 1975, it is reported that the bison discovered the National Elk Refuge at the southern end of the Jackson Hole valley, near the town of Jackson. Soon after, they would also find the supplemental winter feed that had been doled out for the free-roaming elk herd since the creation of the refuge in 1912.
Absent normal winter mortality, the bison population began to grow at a rapid rate. By the mid-1990s, the Jackson bison herd was approaching 1,000 animals. Bison were showing up on horse and cattle feed lines on private lands, sometimes goring livestock. Bison were also regularly having to be herded off the green grass of Jackson Hole golf courses and residences along the Snake River and in the town of Kelly. Bison numbers needed to be controlled.
As with all of Wyoming’s big game, recreational hunting was the desired tool of wildlife managers for curbing growth. And there was no shortage of hunters ready and willing to help bring numbers down.

However, through legal action, the Fund for Animals successfully blocked bison hunting on the National Elk Refuge until an interagency management plan was approved in 2007, which allowed for hunting on the refuge. By this time the bison herd had hit 1,200 animals.
Over the next several years, hunters would help managers bring the population back down to the desired population objective of 500, which is where it hovers today. Still, Wyoming is one of only a handful of places in the world with a wild, free-ranging bison herd for all to enjoy.

In late August, the Colorado-based runner completed an out-and-back of the iconic 13,775-foot peak in a blistering 3:45:34. She did it just days after a Canadian runner set a new female record on the mountain.
The post No fanfare, no shortcuts: Jane Maus breaks female speed record on Grand Teton appeared first on WyoFile .","There’s been a lot of hubbub over the last year surrounding the Grand Teton speed attempt. Runner Michelino Sunseri’s now-infamous 2024 shortcut set off a national debate and courtroom saga over outdoor ethics, the responsibilities of professional athletes with thousands of followers and hefty penalties for trail transgressions. 
Amid all of this, a professional runner from Boulder, Colorado, quietly set her sights on the vaunted peak. Jane Maus temporarily relocated to the Tetons in August, scouted the Grand and began her own journey toward breaking the female speed record.
With very little fanfare and zero shortcuts, Maus did just that on Aug. 22. She ran the 13.2-miles out-and-back route — with its sections of technical scrambling and some 7,000 feet of elevation gain — in a blistering 3:45:34. That put her more than 20 minutes faster than the previous fastest known time, or FKT, which was set just three days earlier by Canadian runner Jazmine Lowther. 
It was by all accounts a stunning physical accomplishment. Maus had gone into the Aug. 22 attempt thinking more that it was another chance to hone her route than to set the record. She was unaccompanied. There was no cameraman to photograph her, no social media buzz to build excitement. But it all fell into place. 
When she ran back into the parking lot and realized what she had done, she said, there wasn’t even anyone to high five. She was so early that her partner hadn’t arrived yet to pick her up. 
“It still feels kind of surreal,” she told WyoFile weeks later. 
Along with setting new benchmarks, Maus and Lowther’s feats also signify a new fidelity to what are considered authorized routes in the niche world of high-alpine speed records. Both women followed what is known as the “Modern Route.”

Fastest Known Time, the organization that tracks these records, recently updated the language in its Grand Teton entry page to note that the Modern Route differs from the Historical Route. That latter includes the shortcut that landed Sunseri in hot water. Previous record holders including Killian Jornet and Jen Day Denton also used the Historical Route. 
“The [Grand Teton National park] Jenny Lake Rangers now prefer that runners stick to designated and maintained trails (where available), which aligns with this Modern Route,” the page reads. “FastestKnownTime indicated it will not accept future submissions using the Historical Route, though it remains an integral part of the mountain’s history and lore.”
For Maus, the old route with the shortcut was never an option. 
“With everything that had happened, and now moving forward, it’s not acceptable to cut the switchback,” she said. “That never crossed my mind.”
Super daunting
Before this season, Maus wasn’t a household name. The 30-year-old dietician grew up in the Salt Lake Valley, where she gained comfort with scrambling through the mountains. She played college-level soccer, and a passion for trail running and rock climbing eventually led to endurance runs and a La Sportiva sponsorship.
Maus’ coach first urged her to try the Grand Teton FKT this spring, saying it would fit in well with her skillset of climbing and running. 
“I was like, ‘that’s absolutely crazy,’” she said.
But after a couple more people brought it up to her, she started considering it. Since she works remotely, she had the flexibility. She decided to at least spend some time on the mountain, though she didn’t presume she was going to break the record, she said. 
“I just kind of committed to trying it out,” she said. “I really had no idea what to expect. But I was like, ‘I have the time. It seems like a really cool objective. I’m just gonna go for it.’”
Maus first climbed the mountain on Aug. 2, alongside her partner, who had climbed it before. They took their time figuring out the route. The technical section was actually not as difficult as she expected, but still. The whole thing took nearly seven hours.

Even seven hours is beyond the realm of most people when it comes to the Grand. The out-and-back climb entails many trail miles along with complex route finding through boulders and technical scrambling. Jackson-area guiding companies typically hike clients up to a saddle, camp overnight, then summit the following morning using ropes and climbing gear for the technical sections before descending to the valley. 
The notion of cutting the entire ordeal to under Denton’s time of 4:15, Maus said, was “super daunting.”
“When it took us almost seven hours, I was like, ‘absolutely not. That’s so much time to cut off,’” she said. 
Training 
Maus climbed the Grand four more times over the next three weeks, each time learning more of the route’s nuances and how to better move through it, she said. But every summit also brought more doubt that she could run up and down in four hours. 
At the same time, there was another athlete gunning for the Grand speed record. Lowther, a runner who has been notching FKTs and top race results in recent years, was in the area with Sunseri, her coach and partner, with her eyes on the Grand. 
Maus bumped into Lowther on that first climb up the mountain. On Aug. 11, Lowther notched the fastest known time in the supported category, which basically means a crew or person is there to help with things like route finding and water carrying. In this case, Sunseri ran with her through the technical terrain, and she finished with a time of 3:51:12. 
“It was a full circle moment for the duo, setting the first GPX-verified FKT on the modern route,” according to an Instagram post from Lowther’s sponsor, Arcteryx. 
Eight days later, Lowther returned to run the mountain alone for the first time. She claimed the unsupported FKT with a time of 4:06:58. 

When Jane Maus set out to run up and down the Grand Teton on Aug. 22, she had  just a hip pack, water bottle, gel packs and a watch to track her attempt. Maus broke the female speed record. (Courtesy Jane Maus) 
Lowther’s achievements unnerved Maus, she said. Maus had by then done the Grand four times and began doubting that she could nab a speed record in the rapidly closing weather window. On Friday, Aug. 22, she got dropped off in the Lupine Meadows parking lot a little before 8 a.m. to do her fifth climb. 
“But I did not feel ready to go for the FKT, by any means,” she said. Instead, her main goal of the day was to better figure out the technical section up top. 
The morning
She had Lowther’s unsupported time of 4:06 in her mind, however, and felt nervous like she does on race mornings. She decided to just try her hardest, no expectations. 
She shot out of the parking lot. The weather was perfect. Getting up to the boulder field, she realized she was ahead of her previous pace. But in the boulders, her legs felt trashed, and she worried that she would bonk. Despite that, she moved efficiently. She began to pick up steam in the fourth-class scrambling between the lower and upper saddle. 
When she hit the summit, she was surprised to find she climbed it 10 minutes faster than ever before, she said. 
“That’s really when I turned it on,” Maus said. “I’m not the strongest descender … but I kind of shut off my brain and went into race mode, and the descent is where I gained most of my time.”

In an attempt like this, the smallest setback can make or break it. But Maus’ descent, like her climb, was smooth. She sprinted into the parking lot that marked the end point. No one was there. 
She looked at her watch, saw that she was 20 minutes faster than the record, and had a moment of disbelief, she said. She wondered briefly if she unwittingly cut a section. She checked her route again, and texted her coach. 
It took a moment for reality to set in, she said, but when her partner arrived, they spent about an hour at the trailhead, celebrating her achievement and reflecting. 
Maus’ accomplishment sets a new standard in mountain running. She still seems a little surprised by it all.
“I had so many people around me that believed I could do this, but I truly did not believe in myself,” she wrote in an Instagram post. “Now I believe them a little bit more.”
She was also humble about the mantle, saying she doesn’t expect to hold onto it. 
“I am confident the strong women in this sport will bring this time way down, and I am so excited that I get to be a part of the story of the Grand Teton,” she wrote. “I truly feel so, so lucky right now.”

André Jacque (R-New Franken), the lead author on the proposal, […]","Gov. Tony Evers and Veterans Affairs Sec. James Bond spoke an event for veterans in the state Capitol on April 22, 2025. (Photo via Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs Facebook page)A Republican bill that would provide funding for the Veterans Housing and Recovery Program received a hearing in the state Senate on Thursday, advancing a potential solution to the cuts the program is facing even as it appears too late to stop the closures. 
Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken), the lead author on the proposal, told the Senate Natural Resources, Veteran and Military Affairs committee that it is the responsibility of lawmakers to ensure that Wisconsin “properly honors the sacrifices made by our brave men and women of the armed services” and his bill would help do that. He also serves as the chair of the committee.
“I know that there’s been a lot of confusion and contentious finger pointing over responsibility for the interruption of service at these sites. Ideally, these issues would have already been resolved but finger pointing accomplishes nothing,” Jacque said. 
The Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP) has been a source of back-and-forth between Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic lawmakers and Republican lawmakers since the closure of two sites, one in Chippewa Falls and the other in the Green Bay area, was announced in July. 
The program, operated by the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, has focused on providing support to veterans on the verge of or experiencing homelessness, including those who have experienced incarceration, unemployment or physical and mental health problems. Veterans in the program are able to participate for a maximum of 24 months, but the average length of stay is six to 10 months.
Evers announced in July that the sites would close on Sept. 30 due to a lack of state funding in the budget. He had requested an additional $2 million from lawmakers to help sustain the program, but that request wasn’t heeded and Democratic attempts to put the funding back in the budget were rejected by Republicans — apart from Jacque, who voted with Democrats. 
Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced shortly after the end of the budget process in July that the two facilities would be closing. 
Evers blamed the closures on lawmakers for not providing the additional funds, while lawmakers said Evers didn’t try to negotiate for the funding.
Then some Republican lawmakers who represent areas surrounding the facilities started claiming that money should be available for the administration to use. In a 16-page letter on Sept. 10, a handful of Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Jesse James (R-Thorp) and Reps. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) and Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), claimed that the Evers administration should have access to funds to help support the program. That letter pointed to the balance that the WDVA returns at the end of the year, though an agency spokesperson has noted that the agency cannot spend funds on whatever the administration chooses, and is “only allowed to spend the money they tell us to spend.”
Evers had also denied the claim, saying “the money is not there.” He noted that a paper from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau to the Joint Finance Committee warned lawmakers that additional funds were needed for the program. 
“Without additional funding, the Department [of Veterans Affairs] would not have sufficient resources to maintain the program’s three sites,” the paper stated.
Senate Bill 411 would provide $900,000 in 2025-26 and $1,050,000 in 2026-27 for the program and for costs associated with the Chippewa Falls site. Jacque’s bill also includes two other policy changes that he said veterans have been requesting. One would require the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin system to provide funding to the UW Missing-in-Action Recovery and Identification Project to support missions to recover and identify Wisconsin veterans who are missing, and the other would lower the eligibility threshold for veterans and surviving spouses to claim the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit.
“We have the opportunity to achieve a proactive, bipartisan solution to the funding problem, and I encourage my committee members to join me in approving this funding package,” Jacque said. “Supporting our veterans has not been and must not be a partisan fight. I truly believe there’s enough support and good will on both sides of the aisle to accomplish each of these priorities.” 
The bill does currently has only nine Republican sponsors and no Democratic sponsors. Democratic lawmakers had proposed their own bill with Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) saying at a press conference that she preferred “clean legislation.” That bill is unlikely to advance in the Republican-led Legislature even as Democrats call for a bill hearing on it. 
Jacque said legislators are also discussing  the potential for the Joint Finance Committee to reallocate funds for the program, and that his conversations about his bill have been productive on both sides of the aisle. 
“That was my goal in bringing it forward immediately after the budget was done, to have a vehicle to continue that conversation and make sure that we get some additional progress done on these issues beyond budget,” Jacque said. 
The VHRP has been funded through three revenue streams: trust fund payments, payments made by program participants and per diem payments, which are made to the agency by the federal government at a current rate of about $71 per resident per day. 
Growing staffing and maintenance costs have strained those funds. A contract with Lutheran Social Services, which staffs the facilities, makes up about 70% of the costs. The Evers administration had postponed some of the looming financial hardship by allocating American Rescue Plan Act funding to the program in 2023-24, but those funds have been expended. 
WDVA Assistant Deputy Secretary Joey Hoey said in testimony that it is too late to stop the closure of the facilities at least for a time.
Hoey said that when the budget passed on July 3, the three VHRP sites were in their fourth year of the federal VA’s Grant and Per Diem (GPD) Program with the option to renew for a fifth and final year starting October 1, 2025.
The agency was forced to consolidate the facilities to the Union Grove location, the site in best physical condition, without dedicated state funding for the program. The agency also had to notify the USDVA that it would not be renewing its grant agreement for Chippewa Falls. It asked to renew and change the scope of the grant agreement that covers both Union Grove and Green Bay, reducing the total number of beds from 57 to 40 to reflect the closure of the Green Bay facility. 
“Being forced to close our facilities in Green Bay and Chippewa Falls was gut wrenching for the veterans and for staff,” Hoey said. “I want to assure everyone in this room that with the help of veteran advocates, our partners at Lutheran Social Services and others, we were able to provide all the veterans in our care at Green Bay and Chippewa Falls with alternative options. As of last week, neither facility has any veterans still at the facility. All those residents have been successfully placed either in other treatment programs for veterans, other treatment programs that are not veteran centered, some have moved to Minneapolis, some moved to Michigan, a good amount have moved to our facility in Union Grove, but no veterans were kicked out on the street.” 
Hoey said even if the state were to pass the bill before the end of September, the state agency cannot rescind the notification for Chippewa Falls. It would only be able to apply for the next round of grants, which wouldn’t be available until October 2026.
“The earliest we could resume the program in Chippewa Falls would be sometime after October 1, 2026,” Hoey said. “If this bill passes, we stand ready to ask the USDVA to change the scope of our agreement covering Union Grove and Green Bay to go back up to the 57 beds included in the original grant. We believe that the USDVA would approve that change, meaning we could resume the program in Green Bay relatively quickly, provided that the landlord has not rented out the facility we were using and that we can sign a contract with Lutheran Social Services.”

Pete Hegseth’s indifference toward the legal requirements governing the use of military power contrasts greatly with the Founding Fathers, constitutional scholar David Adler writes.
The post Even the defense secretary is required to follow the law appeared first on WyoFile .","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s indifference to the Constitution and American law, as well as his disdain for “tepid legality” as the governing standard for the use of U.S. military power, places him at sharp odds with those who founded this nation and held the office of the Presidency. John Quincy Adams, after serving as secretary of state and president, said, “the war power is strictly constitutional.” Like his predecessors in the nation’s highest office, Adams fully understood that the president’s authority over foreign relations was no less circumscribed than the domestic powers conferred by the Constitution.

Opinion

Hegseth’s blithe disregard of law is unbecoming of a constitutional officer whose authority exists only by virtue of that vested in his office by the Constitution, which he has sworn an oath to uphold, and such powers as Congress, to which he is legally accountable and subject to  removal through impeachment, may choose to confer upon him. Hegseth’s arrogant dismissal of legal boundaries invites the scale of scorn that the founders reserved for usurpers, those who abused power and obstructed justice, beginning with King George III, whom they singled out in the Declaration of Independence as a tyrant.
Hegseth’s enthusiasm for President Donald Trump’s executive order changing the name of “Department of Defense” to the “Department of War” was reflected in his slam-poetry-like explanation of the rebranding as not just a name change, but a shift in attitude, posture and strategy. Hegseth said the war department is “going to go on offense, not just defense. Maximum lethality, not tepid legality. Violent effect, not politically correct.” Successful prosecution of wars always has been, and always will be, the goal of our armed forces, but it is critical to recall that war, from its commencement to its conclusion, must be conducted in accord with the Constitution and applicable laws. On this point, the founders, and judicial rulings issued at the dawn of the republic, were crystal clear. 
Respect for the Constitution and its allocation of the war power to Congress, fortified by the presidential oath of office and the Article II duty “to take care to faithfully execute the laws,” informed the decisions of founding presidents when questions of war and military hostilities arose. No early president — Jefferson, Madison and Monroe, for example —  shared Hegseth’s disdain for legality.
In 1801, and again in 1805, President Jefferson, faced with military threats from Tripoli and Spain, respectively, refused to go on “offense,” when, “considering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force.” The threat of invasion did not stop Jefferson from consultation with Congress. 
President Madison, the chief architect of the Constitution, reiterated the constitutional governance of the use of force on June 1, 1812, when he called attention to the English attacks on American shipping. He referred to Congress the question of whether we should oppose “force to force in defense of our national rights,” which he said, was a “solemn question which the Constitution wisely confides to the legislative department of the Government.” 
After the adoption of the Monroe Doctrine, Colombia sought protection from France in 1824. President Monroe, who was a delegate to the Virginia Convention, stated, “The Executive has no right to compromise the nation in any question of war.” He echoed Secretary of State Adams, who declared that the Constitution vests that power in Congress, alone.
Chief Justice John Marshall, a vigorous participant in the Virginia Ratification Convention, stated in Talbot v. Seeman (1801): “The whole power of war being, by the Constitution vested in Congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides in this inquiry.” There was no departure from this understanding in the crisis of the Civil War. In the Prize Cases (1862), the high court held: “By the Constitution, Congress alone has the power to declare a national or foreign war.” The president, “has no power to initiate or declare war against a foreign nation or a domestic State. If a war be made by invasion of a foreign nation, the president is bound to resist force by force. He does not initiate the war but is bound to accept the challenge.”
In matters of war and peace, the founders, unlike Secretary Hegseth, demonstrated respect, not disdain, for legality.

“When ICE said: ‘Hey, would you be interested in doing that?,’ we jumped at the chance,” Garber says. But, he adds, talks have stalled since.
In April, LPSO spokesperson Valerie Ponseti told The Times-Picayune that the sheriff’s office was in “active negotiations with ICE to fulfill key regional functions.”
In an interview with The Current on Friday, Garber confirmed that this was in reference to an offer from his office to federal immigration enforcement agencies to temporarily house immigrant detainees at the jail annex building, a 15,000 square-foot facility built in 1993 to house federal inmates, with enough space for 96 detainees.
However, those negotiations have become less active in recent months, according to Garber. “I haven’t heard anything from them, I can’t get an update,” he says. “I think they’re just overwhelmed.”

The Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem has made a push to utilize state and local facilities to hold immigrant detainees, a population that has increased significantly since the new administration came into office, engaging with governors and state leaders supportive of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement strategy.
“Most of them are interested,” Noem told CBS in early August, “many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.”
Last week, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced that 51 immigrant detainees had been moved to a formerly closed unit at Angola State Penitentiary, with plans to bring that inmate population to 200 by the end of the month. The unit, Camp J, was closed in 2018, citing security concerns and safety risks, but Landry in July declared a state emergency to fast-track fixes.
Louisiana is already one of the states with the largest population of immigrant detainees, second only to Texas, and has become a hub of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
An increasing number of Louisiana state and local agencies have also entered formal partnerships with ICE.
State agencies from Louisiana Alcohol and Tobacco Control to the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, along with state corrections, police, military and the fire marshal, have all entered agreements with ICE under the 287g program over the past four months. Several local law enforcement agencies are also partners under that program.

Thursday’s address was Underly’s first during her second term in office. She won reelection in April this year. She used the address as an opportunity to call for the state to give more support to schools.
“Public education in Wisconsin is not just a system; it’s a living story written daily by the people who believe in its promise…  by students walking into classrooms filled with possibility, by the teachers who dedicate their lives to unlocking potential, by the families and the communities who support them,” Underly said. However, she warned that pride in the public education story “does not guarantee a happy ending.” 
“Pride alone can’t patch a leaking roof. Pride doesn’t shrink a class of 32. Pride will not put a counselor in every school, and pride does not replace sustainable funding. Pride doesn’t fix inequity,’ Underly said. “Pride must be paired with action.” 
The first several months of Underly’s term have been marked by federal upheaval as the Trump administration has abruptly paused and pulled federal funding that goes to education priorities and also by the completion of a state budget that fell short of public school advocates’ goals. 
Underly said the Trump administration is using funding as a bargaining chip by withholding it with little notice in order to demand schools comply with unclear and unlawful requests. 
Most recently, the Trump administration decided to withhold nearly $11 million in grants to support deafblind students and special education teachers. The explanation delivered to the state DPI was that the programs “reflect the prior administration’s priorities and policy preferences and conflict with those of the current administration.” 










We teach our students to stand up to bullies, but this year, the biggest school-yard bully in our public schools is our own federal government


– Superintendent Jill Underly


Over the summer, schools across the nation were thrown into uncertainty after the Trump administration said it would be withholding Title program payments. The administration eventually reversed its decision. 
“Their efforts seek to sow confusion and create chaos and erode trust in an education system already under incredible pressure. We teach our students to stand up to bullies, but this year, the biggest school-yard bully in our public schools is our own federal government,” Underly said. “We will not allow politics or outside forces to rewrite the story of Wisconsin’s public schools. We will not stand by while the future of our children is at stake. We will fight, we will lead, and we will stand up for every student.”
Underly also said the state government is putting school districts in a situation where they must stretch their budgets and are left to solve their problems alone. 
“Decades of insufficient funding have forced a historic number of districts into an impossible situation, turning to referenda year after year just to survive, all while facing micromanaging from Madison and endless finger pointing from lawmakers who too often choose politics over partisanship,” Underly said. 
The state budget, which was passed by the Republican-led state Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers, included a boost in special education funding from about 30% to 45%. But school districts have said that another aspect of the budget, which made no increase at all in state aid for both years of the biennium, left them in a tight spot. Underly said the budget was “not perfect” but “makes meaningful progress for our schools, especially in special education” and acts as a “starting point.” 
‘Pulling resources away from public schools to fund private ones’
“And here’s the truth: We are starving one system while funding another. We cannot afford to keep pulling resources away from public schools to fund private ones and expect both to thrive. That is not good stewardship, and that is not Wisconsin,” Underly said. 
Underly was referencing the state’s school voucher programs, which allow students to use public funds to attend participating private schools. Caps on the program, which limit the number of students who can participate, are scheduled to lift after the 2025-26 school year. 
The growth of the state’s school voucher programs coincides with public school districts’ increasing reliance on raising money through property tax hikes that local taxpayers have to decide whether to approve.
“This under-investment has created a growing sense in too many classrooms during too many school board meetings and around too many kitchen tables that our schools are being left to go it alone,” Underly said. 
Underly said the financial pressures are placing teachers and students under other types of stress as well. 
“Our schools are not failing. We are failing our schools, and we can’t afford to keep writing this chapter. If we truly believe in writing a better story for public education, then it’s long past time for our state to step up and deliver on its promise,” Underly said. “When we underfund, we burn out teachers. When we ignore, we lose talent.” 
Underly called attention to the mental health problems that many students are facing, saying that the political environment could be making things worse. She specifically noted the high rates of depression, anxiety and self-harm among LGBTQ+ students, especially transgender students. 
“The debates taking place in the public sphere, and right here in this Capitol building aren’t about sports,” Underly said, referencing bills that have been debated this year that would bar transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams. “They’re about something much deeper — whether kids are allowed to belong. It’s not just one group of kids, it’s every kid. It’s the kid who doesn’t know where their next meal is going to come from. It’s the kid growing up in a low-income neighborhood without access to the same opportunities just a few miles away. It’s the kids still learning English like so many generations of Americans before them, navigating a world that too often makes them feel invisible. It’s the rural kid who has big dreams but lacks access to broadband or after-school programs.” 
Undery said that despite the challenges, there is hope for the future of Wisconsin schools. 
“Throughout history, Wisconsin has led the way,” Underly said, noting that the state had the first kindergarten program in the country and created one of the first statewide public library systems. 
“That courage, that commitment to progress, that’s in Wisconsin’s DNA,” Underly said. “Now, we stand at a defining moment. In this next chapter, you re-elected me to lead that work not to maintain the status quo, but to drive real change to lead to act to set a clear path forward, and that’s exactly what I intend to do.” 
She listed priorities including hands-on learning, embracing new technologies, creating personalized learning experiences and recruiting and retaining teachers. She also said DPI is also working to modernize to be a “stronger and more effective partner” to schools and educators.
“The future isn’t red. The future isn’t blue. The future, Wisconsin, is sitting in our classrooms right now, and this is our wake-up call. This is the mirror we must face,” Underly said. “Will we be the generation that looked away as our schools crumbled? Or will we be the ones who stood up, kept our promise, and chose to write a different story?”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The federal judge handling former House Speaker Glen Casada’s political corruption case hinted this week that the Franklin Republican could serve more time than his ex-staffer who was sentenced to 30 months in prison.
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson, who said a lot of things several times during the sentencing of Cade Cothren, told the courtroom that Casada’s sentencing range will be two levels higher because he was a public official. Cothren, in contrast, had stepped down in 2019 from his chief of staff post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal, even if he did influence a public official.
Richardson also said Cothren got about 50% less than he could have based on sentencing guidelines, based in part on letters from supporters.
After being bounced from his $200,000 job, Cothren needed money, and he, Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith hatched a plan to direct business to a shell company Cothren formed, New Mexico-based Phoenix Solutions, that did constituent mailers for lawmakers (Smith called it “low-hanging fruit” in her testimony), before moving on to campaigns and Republican Caucus work. 
Richardson pointed out “it takes two to tango in a case like this,” meaning one couldn’t have done it without the other.

Although the judge said it wasn’t the worst case of honest services fraud he’d ever seen, Richardson called Cothren’s actions “pretty crummy,” “dishonest” and “below” the position of House Speaker chief of staff. He was also convicted of conspiracy and bribery.
The judge gave Cothren some credit for receiving support letters from former Rep. Kent Calfee, Rep. Paul Sherrell and Rep. Todd Warner. 
But even their letters of support came with strings attached. Calfee’s former administrative assistant, Nadine Korby, is the mother of Cothren’s girlfriend. Warner has used another company connected to Cothren, Dixieland Strategies, for campaign work, and a political action committee Cothren formed through an ex-girlfriend, the Faith, Family, Freedom Fund, worked against Warner’s first opponent, incumbent Rep. Rick Tillis. (None of the latter was discussed in court.)
Calfee’s wife, Marilyn, testified in support of Cothren, along with the defendant’s first cousin, Emily Isom.
But Richardson acknowledged that Cothren backers appeared to be wearing “rose-colored glasses” as they spoke glowingly of him.
And even though he acknowledged that Cothren might not have thought he was committing a crime, Richardson still managed to say that Tennesseans could ask the question: “Is this someone’s idea of a joke?”
The judge also continued to bring up the fact that Cothren submitted a “bogus” W-9 form with the signature of “Matthew Phoenix” when the state asked all vendors to turn in federal tax forms.
It’s one of those little points that could stick with a court of appeals when Cothren’s team takes this to another level. The defense requested Cothren be allowed to postpone his prison sentence until the appeal is done. The judge took it under advisement.
But before that, Richardson said the case “has the overall sense that none of this had to happen.” (And why would it, if everything was above board?) The judge said Cothren didn’t have to lie. Nor did he have to misrepresent himself as “Matthew Phoenix” on the W-9.
Richardson also said reasonable people in Tennessee could say “WTH,” meaning, “What the heck.” 
Sorry judge. We understand you can’t say in court what most people have been thinking for six years since Cothren and Casada left their high-ranking posts and then FBI agents raided them. 
No, most people would substitute a different expletive at the end. But you can always recast the phrasing when Casada comes to court this Tuesday.
Backing Hillsdale?
Two gubernatorial candidates, U.S. Rep. John Rose and state Rep. Monty Fritts, are scheduled to participate in a Tennessee Alliance town hall Oct. 18 in Lebanon, where a Hillsdale Classical Education supporter is to speak. U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn is not listed to appear.
Also on the agenda are election integrity, the increase of political Islam in America, sovereignty from a representative of the John Birch Society, the “trouble” that could be coming from schools along with the need to set up Hillsdale College’s Classical Education in Tennessee schools.

Gov. Bill Lee got into a heap of trouble a few years ago when he unveiled plans to put 50 Hillsdale-affiliated schools into the state. Public sentiment against the Michigan-based Christian college grew when the college’s president, Larry Arnn, was secretly recorded at a Franklin event saying teachers are educated in the “dumbest parts of the dumbest colleges in the country.”
Since then, though, the state’s charter commission has approved applications for Classical Education schools in Jackson and Rutherford County. 
Rose’s campaign chairman, Chris Devaney, confirmed the congressman is slated to participate in the gubernatorial forum but declined to say whether he supports Hillsdale-related schools or the other items to be discussed. 
“He is looking forward to answering questions and hearing from this group of freedom loving Tennesseans,” Devaney said.
Fritts, a graduate of conservative Christian Liberty University, said Thursday the forum is on his schedule as well.
He wasn’t clear on Lee’s plans, which changed during public outcry, but he called the items Hillsdale puts out for historical context “prime stuff.”
“I think Hillsdale College does a good job with lots of things,” Fritts said. “They pursue beauty and truth in a classical education.” 
House chairman knocks charter commission override authority

Questions have been raised about Hillsdale’s curriculum for American Classical Education charter schools and whether it downplays the importance of Black Americans’ historical contributions and Martin Luther King’s contention that the force of law should be used to back the civil rights movement.
Hillsdale-affiliated schools use a 1776 curriculum prompted by President Donald Trump to focus on achievements by the nation’s founders and offset a 1619 curriculum that gave the treatment of Black Americans a more central role in American history.
Pizza where?
House Speaker Cameron Sexton recently traveled to Rome where he went to Vatican City and met Pope Leo and gave him a Tennessee Vols football jersey with the number 14, a reference to Leo being the 14th papal Leo.
The trip, which was paid for by the Council of State Governments, included stops to see what he called “amazing history,” the Coliseum, Spanish Steps and the Italian Parliament (only the House side, of course).

— Speaker Cameron Sexton (@CSexton25) September 8, 2025
Sexton said the group also enjoyed some excellent Italian food “off the beaten path” in Florence, but he didn’t exactly give the pizza rave reviews.
Instead, he said he prefers pizza at a Tennessee restaurant that is “very Italianesque.”
“I get it in Crossville, of all places, if you can imagine that,” he said, possibly referring to accusations that he lives in Nashville instead of the town on the Cumberland Plateau.
Regardless, it seems a trip halfway around the world would yield an authentic slice. But we can take solace that a two-hour drive instead of an 11-hour flight will lead us to the world’s best pizza.
No doubt, some Nashville restaurateurs will appeal that ruling.

The record enrollment of more than 256,000 this fall represents a 3.4% increase over 2024.
The enrollment total is significant. It comes at a time that higher education is facing a demographic challenge caused by falling birth rates in the United States.

North Carolina’s historically black universities saw some of the largest percentage increases this year. Fayetteville State University saw enrollment rise 7.3%, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University was up 6.7%, with North Carolina Central University up 6.8%. Policies raising the enrollment caps for out-of-state students may have helped those HBCUs excel.
Only the University of North Carolina Asheville experienced a decline in enrollment. But officials acknowledged the 6% decline could be related to the ongoing Hurricane Helene recovery. The campus was closed for 33 days last year during the peak season for recruitment and campus tours.
The UNC System also credits the growth in part to policies that simplify the transfer and admissions process. NC College Connect offered automatic admission to more than 62,000 high school seniors with a weighted grade point average of 2.8 or above.
An era of financial uncertainty
In-state undergraduate tuition has not increased in the UNC System for nine straight years. Few states can make that claim.
But on Thursday, UNC Board of Governors Chair Wendy Floyd Murphy indicated that the system would not be able to continue holding tuition rates in place.
“Generous state funding has allowed us to keep tuition low, and we are grateful for the support of our leaders in the North Carolina legislature. Even so, we are now in an era of some financial uncertainty,” said Murphy. “Inflation has driven up the cost of operations at our institutions.
“Universities have absorbed those pressures while holding the line on tuition, but we cannot expect them to continue doing so without negative impacts.”
Murphy said potential budget changes both at the federal and state level mean the system must strengthen financial positions at the campus level.
“After careful consideration, the board will allow our universities to propose modest tuition increases of up to 3% for resident undergraduates,” Murphy said.  “But let me be clear, this doesn’t change our existing policies around college affordability. We’ve guaranteed students that if they graduate in four years, their tuition will not rise.”
Murphy said the system has built faculty teaching workloads to make sure students can earn the credits they need to graduate on time, taking on less debt.

UNC’s fixed tuition guarantee will remain in place for students, and any increases in resident undergraduate tuition will only apply to new students who enroll in the fall of 2026.
The system notes that special fees may be considered, but only to cover inflationary costs for existing academic programs, or to pay for new programs approved by the Board of Governors.
North Carolina Promise Institutions — Elizabeth City State, Fayetteville State, UNC Pembroke and Western Carolina — will continue to offer reduced resident tuition rates set by the state legislature.
Murphy stressed that the tuition increase will not be automatic. Campuses will be required to develop proposals with input from their communities and boards of trustees and have their proposals reviewed by the system’s Board of Governors in February 2026.
“Going forward, we will be judicious. We simply acknowledge the reality of rising cost and the need to protect our institutions, preserve quality of instruction and ensure student success.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


A program aimed at increasing the number of biomedical researchers from underrepresented groups fell victim to the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity this spring.
The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, begun in 2009, had been budgeted $712,108 this fiscal year, according to a website that tracks National Institutes of Health grant terminations. The IMSD program had received $273,558 when NIH terminated the grant in April, according to the website.
A separate National Institutes of Health report shows the project principals received $379,791 in fiscal 2024 and $332,317 this fiscal year.
The grant was one of eight at UAMS that NIH shut down because language in the grant descriptions contained words indicating they might be used to advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. This included an apparently purely scientific cancer research grant that contained the phrase “trans” in its project description; the tagged word was “translocation.”

Medical school spokesperson Leslie Taylor said by email that, “had they run their entire grant cycle, the loss would have been about $5.5 million.”
“The projects that were funded by the terminated grants have to be shut down because we must maintain compliance with federal initiatives,” Taylor said. “If researchers have funding for different projects, they can possibly move personnel to other funded projects when appropriate.” 
Regarding the IMSD grant, she said it was hard to know what extent its shutdown would have on other research because the program “funded graduate students who went on to join labs at UAMS working on various areas of research. Without the IMSD, we can’t admit those additional students, which would impact how many students are available to join our research programs.”
The National Institutes of Health began cancelling grants this spring after a January presidential executive order demanded the end of any programs or grants addressing diversity, equity and inclusion issues. A federal judge ordered a halt to the grant cancellations, but the U.S. Supreme Court in August said the government could proceed to formally terminate $783 million in NIH funding.
The grants to UAMS and other Arkansas institutions were in various stages of funding, according to the grant-tracking website.
A $1.25 million NIH grant to University of Arkansas researchers, for example, was titled “STEAM Education and Training for Underrepresented Students and Teachers in the Arkansas Delta.” When the study was canceled in May, all but $482,257 had been disbursed, according to university public information officer Rebecca Morrison. 
The Arkansas Cancer Coalition’s $1.12 million NIH grant aimed to help it develop strategies for reducing cancer and chronic disease in the Arkansas Delta by helping people travel to screening opportunities, according to the grant application abstract. At the time the grant was canceled, the coalition had received $573,304, according to the grant-tracking website. Coalition officials could not be reached for comment.
Among the canceled research projects at UAMS was a $3 million grant to study the utilization of health services among older Black men and whether a universal basic income of $500 a month would improve health outcomes for that population, according to the project description on the NIH website.
The grant terminations haven’t diminished UAMS’ ability to attract major research funds from NIH. Since March, the state medical school has announced more than $12 million in grants for continued cancer research: nearly $3 million to study DNA structures that might affect cancer treatment, $3.4 million to study a virus linked to some cancers that evades the immune system, and $5.8 million to continue studying cancer treatment side effects.
In addition to NIH, the National Science Foundation also canceled eight grants to University of Arkansas researchers worth about $6 million, according to figures provided by Morrison, the university PIO.
UALR received an NSF grant of $269,860 that provided research experiences for undergraduates. Vice Provost of Research Brian Berry said the program was over by the time the grant was canceled, “so there was no impact.” 
A similar situation occurred at the UA Fayetteville campus, according to figures from Morrison.

(Photos by West Virginia Department of Health and Kristian Thacker)The state of West Virginia has pushed back closing on the sale of its four long-term facilities to Oct. 31. The hospitals, many of which are deteriorating, typically serve elderly patients using Medicaid. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey is selling hospitals in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia to New York-based Marx Development Group for $60 million. Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. 
Majestic Care, a subsidiary of MDG, will operate the facilities in West Virginia. 
“While the Department of Health Facilities, MDG and Majestic Care were hopeful that the transaction could be completed by Sept. 30, 2025, all parties understood that it might not be possible to accomplish the extensive and necessary tasks for a complete closing and transition of operations by that date,” DoHF Communications Director Gailyn M. Markham said. 
“This additional time will allow the parties to ensure a seamless transition of operations, employees, and residents, all of which remain top priorities for all parties,” she said.
There is a pending lawsuit, brought by a Democratic state senator on behalf of a patient, that seeks to stop the sale of John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont. A notice of suit said the sale was unlawful without the Legislature’s approval. Markham didn’t cite the lawsuit in its reason for the delay.
The four state-owned hospitals often house and take care of elderly patients — some with complex medical problems and disabilities — who have nowhere else to go. Many patients rely on Medicaid and can’t afford private care.
Morrisey has said the private company will make “significant investments” in the state and improve the level of health care. All of the facilities are operating at a financial loss to the state and need millions of dollars in repairs. MDG has agreed to build three to five new facilities to replace aging facilities though the locations are undetermined.
The governor’s office hasn’t yet released any records related to the sale, which was originally supposed to close at the end of this month. In response to a Freedom of Information Act Request, an attorney in the governor’s office said non-exempt documents will be shared Sept. 26.
Morrisey has also promised that the private company will retain patients and staff. The state has been heavily reliant on contract nurses to staff state-owned hospitals. 
Earlier this month, letters were sent out to state hospital employees asking them to indicate if they will apply for a position with MDG, explore retirement options or resign from their position with the state. Hospital employees shared the letter with West Virginia Watch. 
The state Department of Health Facilities confirmed a letter was sent. 
“As the DHF long term care facilities transition to new ownership under Marx Development Group (MDG), which will be operated by Majestic Care, our priority is to ensure employees are supported and that their preferences are respected throughout the process,” Markham wrote in an email. 
“MDG, and Majestic Care, have made it clear that current staff will be offered opportunities to continue their employment post-transition in addition to career pathways and training designed to help staff grow,” she added. 
Residents in Majestic Care’s nursing homes in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana receive around an hour less nursing care per day on average than residents at the state’s four hospitals, according to federal health agency reports and reported by Mountain State Spotlight. 
Majestic officials told the news outlet that the company meets all state and federal staffing requirements and that it offers competitive pay and benefits.

The company will offer private insurance, and 322 state employees at the four hospitals are insured through the state’s Public Employee Insurance Agency. A spokesperson for Morrisey said that “their removal from the PEIA system will not have a significant impact” on the financially troubled insurance program. 
Hopemont Hospital, one of the facilities being sold, is in the district of Senate President Randy Smith. 
“Most of the correspondence I’m getting is from people there at the hospital over their retirement,” he said on Thursday. “My concern is these employees that are close to retirement, or you know, or are invested to make sure that you know they’re protected, because it’s nothing to do with their fault.”
Smith is considering legislation to ensure state employees affected by the sale can retain their pensions. He has requested data from DoHF about the numbers of employees that are within a few years of retirement, he said.  
He’d like to see a special legislative session this fall to deal with the issue. 
“I’ve talked to several legislators, and you know they’re in agreement with me — it’s only fair to make sure that these people’s pensions are protected,” he said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Universities of Wisconsin faculty and staff employees seeking a voice in UW operations have gained the ears of a number of UW regents, a union leader said Thursday, and want their request for recognition put on the Board of Regents agenda in October.
In March, American Federation of Teachers/Wisconsin leaders had hoped to confront the regents with their campaign to give faculty and staff employees a voice. Their efforts to meet in person then were thwarted.
AFT/Wisconsin’s immediate aim is to gain an agreement from the regents that would enable the union and university management to “meet and confer” over compensation and working conditions for faculty and academic staff in a non-binding process.
AFT/Wisconsin President Jon Shelton said Thursday that “a lot has happened” to advance the union’s goals since the March demonstration.
“We’ve started to have some really productive conversations with a number of individual regents,” Shelton told the Wisconsin Examiner just before a rally outside the University of Wisconsin-Madison building where the regents were meeting Thursday.
“We’d really like to see a meet-and-confer policy on the agenda in the Board of Regents’ October meeting,” said Shelton, a professor at the UW-Green Bay. “We’ve communicated that to the Board of Regents and feel like we’re really making progress.”
The rally preceded a silent demonstration at the start of the regents’ meeting Thursday in the Gordon Dining and Event Center on the UW-Madison campus.
A couple of dozen union members and supporters took seats in the meeting room in the 20 minutes or so before the meeting started at 1 p.m. They sat silently during the opening remarks, which started with an admonition from Board President Amy Bogost that any disruption “will be handled swiftly with responsible individuals subject to disciplinary action and/or citations for the disruption.”
At about 2 minutes into the meeting, the union group stood and silently walked out when Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman spoke to address the regents.
The campaign for union recognition took shape two years ago at a summit by faculty and campus advocates seeking “to do something about the diminishing conditions in the education system,” Shelton said at the rally before the meeting.
“And one of the things that we decided to do that day was to push for union recognition in the education system,” he said. “And for too long our voices as workers had been ignored by administration after administration after administration on campuses across the education system.”
A university system spokesman said Thursday that campuses rely on shared governance for faculty and staff input.
“Leadership at our universities and at the Universities of Wisconsin Administration meet regularly with shared governance groups to consult on a wide range of matters,” said Mark Pitsch, director of media relations for the Universities of Wisconsin. “These shared governance groups are authorized by state statute and regent policy as the official, elected bodies to represent faculty and staff.”
Campus union leaders contend, however, the shared governance system is ineffectual.
Speaking at the rally before the regents’ meeting, Lauren Gantz, an English professor at UW-Stevens Point, said there has been “very little discussion in shared governance” to work out details of a partnership with another college, and “no real concern for the working conditions of our faculty and academic staff” in the arrangement.
Gantz, who is co-president of an AFT faculty and staff union at UW-Stevens Point, said in an interview that among the top issues for faculty and staff seeking union representation was workload.
“We’ve lost a lot of personnel, both faculty and academic and university staff,” Gantz said. “We’ve had repeated discussions about the burnout conditions on our campus, and we’d like to be able to actually take some concrete steps to deal with that rather than slapping a Band-Aid on things.”
A rally speaker, Stephanie Spehar, former president of the faculty and staff union at the UW Oshkosh, said that when the university was confronted with a deficit of $18 million in 2023, “our administration did not consult with any of us workers” about how to address the deficit. “If they had done that, if we had meet and confer, I think we would have had very different outcomes,” she said.
Shelton said in an interview the union’s meet-and-confer proposal includes provisions that would require the union to demonstrate support from 35% of an individual university’s faculty and staff on a petition or a total of 500 people.
“This is not like some small minority of people who are pushing for this,” he said.
The union is asking for meet-and-confer discussion because collective bargaining is currently off limits as a result of the 2011 law known as Act 10, stripping most public employees in Wisconsin of most union rights. Although the law is now the subject of a lawsuit and a Dane County circuit court judge found it unconstitutional, the law remains in effect while the case is appealed.
The meet-and-confer is just a first step, however, Shelton told the rally. “And then next year, it’s flipping the Legislature” from a Republican majority to a Democratic one “and pushing for a collective bargaining bill in the UW system,” he said. “Because every single worker deserves to have a seat at the table and collective bargaining.”

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, arrives before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before a U.S. Senate Finance Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Safe and affordable housing is out of reach for too many Idaho families, and we all pay the price when rents are too high. 
U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is working to alleviate these housing challenges through the introduction of the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act. This bipartisan package includes long-term policy solutions that are needed to address our state’s housing challenges – including more than 40 provisions aimed at cutting red tape to access federal housing assistance, building more homes, and updating outdated programs. 
Rents are unaffordable for the average Idaho renter. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s 2025 Out of Reach Report, an Idaho renter needs to earn nearly $28 an hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment, and renters living in the Boise area must earn $35 an hour. However, the average Idaho renter only earns $19 an hour – indicating a significant gap between Idaho wages and Idaho rents. For a minimum-wage worker earning $7.25 an hour, that means clocking more than 150 hours a week – essentially four full-time jobs – just to keep a roof above their family’s heads.  
School disruption is a significant – and overlooked – impact of housing loss for Idaho kids

In addition to Idaho’s high rents, our state is also experiencing a shortage of nearly 25,000  affordable and available homes for renters with low incomes. A home is affordable when a family spends no more than 30 percent of their household income on housing. 
That means almost 25,000 Idaho families are paying more than they can afford on rent and likely only one emergency expense away from facing eviction. These families must also make tough choices every month between paying for rent, nutritious food, health care, school supplies, gas, and other basic necessities. 
The ROAD to Housing Act of 2025 aims to alleviate these barriers by offering long-term policy solutions that strengthen our housing system for the future. It’s a chance to make progress on the housing challenges Idaho faces by creating stability, expanding opportunity, and ensuring families have a path to affordable and stable homes. 
It creates an annual fund to help states and cities reform zoning laws, encourage smaller homes like duplexes and backyard apartments, and tackle the roadblocks that stop new housing from being built. It also strengthens Housing and Urban Development programs with funding for repairs to aging homes, streamlined housing vouchers, and expanded support for rural communities, veterans, and people experiencing homelessness. 
Housing is about more than four walls. When families have a safe, affordable place to live, kids do better in school, parents can focus on work, and low-income households can begin to build stability instead of falling further behind. Strong housing policy also strengthens local economies; businesses thrive when workers can afford to live nearby and take the jobs they’re trained for. 
As of Aug. 1, 2025, the Road to Housing Act of 2025 passed the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. It is now on track for consideration by the full Senate.

Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, speaks into the microphone at his first game as LSU's public address announcer. (Courtesy of Dixon McMakin) Dixon McMakin, the new public address announcer at LSU’s Tiger Stadium, has a complex relationship with the state’s flagship university. 
Son of 1970s LSU baseball star Wally McMakin, he is undoubtedly an LSU sports fanatic. But as an attorney, he has sued the school. And as a legislator, he has leaned hard on the university, even publicly joking about cutting its budget. 
McMakin, a 39-year-old Republican, has represented House District 68 in the Louisiana Legislature since January 2024. He’s also a financial adviser, insurance broker and an attorney who isn’t afraid to take on his alma mater. 
In addition to taking over this year from Dan Borne as the Voice of Tiger Stadium, McMakin is the radio play-by-play commentator for Catholic High football. He has worked as a public address announcer for LSU volleyball and softball games since 2020. 
He is paid for his PA work but does not have a contract with the university, McMakin said in an interview with the Illuminator and Tiger Rag. LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell said McMakin is paid $125 per game. 
“This was not a political pick,” McMakin said of his receiving the Tiger Stadium announcer’s job. “I just happened to be a guy that was elected when I got picked.” 
He is undoubtedly a Baton Rouge boy, born to one icon and stepson to another, retired longtime WBRZ-TV news anchor Andrea Clesi McMakin. 
McMakin got his undergraduate, MBA and law degrees from LSU, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. His wife, Bess Casserleigh, a WBRZ anchor, is one of the most visible women in the city. 
Behind his purple and gold exterior, Tiger Stadium’s new announcer is also among the most conservative legislators at the Capitol and at times a vocal critic of the state’s flagship university. 
“Any critique comes from a great admiration and love more than anything else,” McMakin said of his alma mater.

Full-court press
Before his Sept. 6 debut in Tiger Stadium for Louisiana Tech vs. LSU, McMakin’s voice rose to prominence in a Baton Rouge courtroom. 
In the 2022 lawsuit McMakin v. LSU, he sued the university to obtain records for Donald Abels, a former LSU Greek Life official accused of using fake social media profiles in 2019 to entrap underage fraternity recruits in underage drinking. Because no laws were broken, LSU handled the matter internally. Abels, who denied the accusations, faced no repercussions and left the school in 2021.
The decision against McMakin set a precedent the university has used to swat down similar requests for its personnel records. Having his name associated with closing off public records didn’t sit right with McMakin, who has a mixed voting record on open government issues but has generally been an advocate for government transparency. 
McMakin’s first goal after being elected was to undo that precedent and get the records he wanted. He quickly filed legislation to remove privacy protections over personnel records for all public employees in Louisiana. His proposal, which lawmakers approved overwhelmingly, would have undermined court decisions that put up significant roadblocks for records related to investigations into public employee misconduct. 
Gov. Jeff Landry vetoed the bill, citing concerns over revealing “sensitive information” such as payroll deductions, prescription medications and emergency contacts. 
Despite the setback, McMakin’s occasional crusades on behalf of LSU students have continued. 
McMakin was among the legislators who intervened this past spring on behalf of an LSU student government presidential ticket whose campaign was disqualified twice. The candidates, former state Senate student workers Alex Foret and Isabelle Tatman, were first accused of bribery and then campaign finance violations. The student-led University Court added their names back to the ballot in both instances, but they ultimately lost the election. 
McMakin has also criticized the university’s protection of the LSU Campus Mounds, believed to be among the oldest manmade structures in the United States. The mounds are also considered to be culturally significant, having been built by Native Americans thousands of years ago. 
Before fences were erected to protect the mounds, they had been worn down by pedestrians and tailgaters. 
McMakin has posted on social media numerous times, calling on LSU to “tear down the fence,” even threatening earlier this year to cut the university’s budget, remarks which he characterized as tongue in cheek in an interview. 
“It’s all built on the idea that I want the flagship university to be the very best and look the very best at everything,” McMakin said.

Laughing as a legislator 
State lawmakers on both sides of the aisle interviewed for this report described McMakin as an incredibly personable lawmaker with an unrelenting sense of humor. 
“He makes me laugh all the time,” Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, said of McMakin, who he sits next to on the House floor. 
Riser and McMakin both filed legislation earlier this year to subsidize college athletics. 
Riser’s bill, which passed, will allow all Division I athletic programs in Louisiana to receive an estimated $2 million in taxpayer dollars annually from sports gambling tax revenue. While fairly insignificant to a major college power such as LSU, the money will go a long way for the state’s smaller D1 schools.   
McMakin’s bill would have exempted athlete name, image and likeness income from state taxes. It failed to gain the needed support, with opponents disliking the optics of giving a tax break to highly compensated college athletes while increasing sales taxes for most citizens. 
McMakin said he is considering bringing the bill back next year. 
His other legislative interests have varied. McMakin’s voting record is extremely conservative, even for his right-of-center district. But that has made him a key ally of Landry and increased his influence in the Republican supermajority legislature. 
The flashiest of his conservative proposals, such as calling a constitutional convention or phasing out the individual income tax, have largely stalled. Other Republican staples, such as restricting panhandling or forbidding people without legal status in the United States from obtaining a Louisiana driver’s license, have fared better. 
McMakin has also had several successful proposals with no partisan tint, including a new law that prohibits universities from charging their student media outlets for public records. It passed the legislature unanimously before earning Landry’s signature. 
Those who have noticed McMakin’s joking flair as an announcer at LSU games have keyed in on it as a central theme in all of his professional endeavors. 
“He does go down there and is really loud and tries to be funny,” Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, said of McMakin’s House floor speeches. “That’s his personality, kind of clowning, not in a negative way.” 
McMakin once pantomimed holding a horse’s reins, trotting back and forth behind a legislator presenting a bill on the horse racing industry.
While some of his peers consider his style at the Capitol to be humorous, they note that he knows when to turn it off. 
For instance, McMakin used his booming voice to rage against the pharmacy chain CVS Health, which sent text messages to state employees threatening to shut down its pharmacies in Louisiana if lawmakers approved a bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers. The “middlemen” companies oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers, including the state of Louisiana.   
“Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,” McMakin said in a House speech on the final day of the legislative session. Lawmakers declined to bring the bill up for a vote. 
McMakin is not the only legislator to take on a big role at a university they represent, though he will certainly be the most high profile. 
State law prohibits individuals from being employed or holding office in two separate branches of government, though some have held legislative seats and worked in higher education, which falls under the executive branch. State Rep. Barbara Carpenter, D-Baton Rouge, is currently the dean of international education at Southern University and also represents the university in the legislature. This dual office-holding has typically gone unchallenged. 
Political observers have noted the possibility of conflicts of interests in these situations requires these legislators to walk a tighter rope. McMakin’s first opportunity to demonstrate how he’ll handle his split allegiances will come when the legislature convenes in March. 
“Anything I’ve ever said or done for LSU was to try to make it better, to compete with the other flagships,” he added.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/McMakin-hz-1024x594.jpg,,,2025-09-19 06:57:09.347029
