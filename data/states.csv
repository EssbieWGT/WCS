U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, a Democrat from Nashua, has represented New Hampshire’s 2nd District in Congress for just over three months. While she acknowledges the hectic nature of becoming a lawmaker during President Donald Trump’s second term, Goodlander made a point to emphasize some basics in an interview with the Bulletin this week: the housing market, health care, and child care prices.
“I think our system is being tested right now in ways that we’ve never seen before,” she said, during a visit Tuesday to Monadnock Community Hospital. “Government’s not functioning at the federal level in the way that it ordinarily functions where, when, as a member of Congress, I ask a question of the Department of Health and Human Services, and we get answers to that question.”
Goodlander harkened back to her work on Trump’s first impeachment trial. Prior to becoming a congresswoman, Goodlander worked in a number of non-elected government roles, including as an adviser to several U.S. senators and in the Biden administration. An attorney, she served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in late 2019 when the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump over a phone call he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy threatening to withhold military aid unless Zelenskyy announced an investigation of Joe Biden. The Republican-led Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump in early 2020. Goodlander compared the administration’s recent actions to those that motivated her and her colleagues to impeach Trump during his first term.
“The case that we brought is really, at bottom, what we’re seeing play out every single day with this administration,” she said. “We’re seeing abuses of power of all varieties, including of the variety that was like the direct case that we brought back in 2019.”
She condemned the Trump administration sending hundreds of migrants to a Salvadoran prison without due process, decried Trump’s tariff strategy as a senseless trade war conducted at ordinary Americans’ expense, and called for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has been embroiled in controversy over mishandling classified information, to resign. Goodlander said that if Democrats were in the majority, she would support an impeachment investigation into Trump.
“There has been no inquiry that has started,” she said. “But what I can tell you is that we’ve seen a pattern and a practice over the course of this second Trump administration that repeated itself in the first and so yes, I do believe that there would be credible grounds to really conduct a thorough investigation. But I want to stress that I really believe that there shouldn’t be casual talk about impeachment proceedings. This is a punishment that our Constitution really reserves for a very, very select subset of offenses. We’re talking treason and high crimes.”
Goodlander said it’s a priority of hers to help her party win a majority in the House of Representatives during 2026’s midterm elections.
“The system our Constitution creates is of three co-equal branches,” she said. “And we need a check on this administration.”
Goodlander cited this as one of the reasons she decided against giving up her seat in the House to run for Senate in 2026. When Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who has represented New Hampshire in the Senate since 2008, announced she wouldn’t seek reelection last month, Goodlander openly considered joining the race to replace her. However, she announced last week she would not launch a campaign, instead endorsing U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who remains the only candidate in that race so far.
“I’m really grateful, and I’m humbled by the outreach that I got from people all across the state who encouraged me to take a look at the Senate seat,” she said. “The job I’m in right now, I’m on Day 109. … I want to dedicate all of my energy towards ensuring that we have a House of Representatives, which is the body that’s closest to the people.”
Throughout communication with constituents, Goodlander said she’s heard consistently about the rising cost of housing, child care, and health care. As such, those are priorities for her, she said.
“Our system is just simply not working for so many hard-working people,” she said. “And we’re in an environment right now where the big fight is about how we’re going to dedicate federal resources and federal programming. And I just can’t think of a more wrong approach than the approach that we see the Republican majority in Congress taking and this administration taking, which is to fund trillions of dollars in tax breaks on the backs of hard-working people, and that’s going to mean higher health care costs. That’s going to mean higher costs across the board.”
She singled out housing among these issues as one she hears about constantly.
“Housing is a cornerstone of the American dream, and it is so far out of reach for far too many people,” she said, pointing to rapidly increasing rent and home sale prices in New Hampshire.
Asked whether she thinks the constant controversies swirling around the White House are a distraction to addressing issues like housing, Goodlander said, “We’ve got to do both at once.”
“We are seeing people — Republicans, independents, Democrats — who are stepping up and speaking out and want to be involved in a way that I don’t think we’ve seen in a long time in this country,” she said. “And this is what gives me a lot of hope: the people who are coming from across the ideological spectrum, some of whom I’m sure voted for President Trump, but did not vote for what they’re seeing happen here right now. They did not vote for the biggest cuts to Medicaid in American history. They did not vote for an indiscriminate, reckless, senseless set of trade wars that are jacking up costs and putting small businesses out of business. This is not what they voted for.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/goodlandertalks-e1745527961692-1024x780.jpg,,,2025-04-25 05:00:27.117092

Unsurprisingly, most of that benefit comes in the form of greater future earnings of kids who attend pre-K and then show up to kindergarten prepared to learn, the analysis said.
“Seven dollars of every $10 of benefits generated by a universal prekindergarten program come from future labor market earnings of children,” Scioto Analysis Principal Rob Moore said in a written statement accompanying the report. “According to the evidence we have, universal prekindergarten could be a strong long-term economic development investment for Ohio.”
The Ohio state government doesn’t fund universal pre-K. Some cities, including Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, and Toledo, have funded pre-K programs that are less than universal. 
Head Start is a federal pre-K program, but in Ohio and most other states, eligibility is generally restricted to families living at or below federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s less than $42,000 a year.
Ohio near bottom in preschool spending compared to other states

The Scioto Analysis report cited research showing that universal pre-K can benefit kids from middle-income families almost as much as it does those from poor ones.
In Ohio, 57% of three and four-year-olds were enrolled in pre-K in 2022. Using the Washington State Institute for Public Policy’s benefit-cost analysis of universal prekindergarten, the Scioto Analysis report modeled the impact on the economy if 71% of Ohio’s preschoolers went to prekindergarten.
It found that adding 29,000 Ohio kids to the program would benefit the economy by cutting the time kids would later spend repeating grades, in prison, or needing special education. But by far and away, the biggest benefit was in kids’ future earnings.
“This benefit occurs because children develop essential cognitive and social skills during prekindergarten which lead to higher academic achievement and better job prospects,” the report said.
In its draft of the biennial budget, the Republican leadership of the Ohio House has been generous to the state’s wealthiest interests.

The billionaire Haslam family wants $600 million to move the Browns out of downtown Cleveland and into a new stadium in Brook Park. House Finance Committee Chairman Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, built that funding into the budget, calling it “a once-in-a-lifetime project.” He added that new stadiums are “huge economic drivers.”
However, most economists who have studied them would disagree. 
They say stadiums by and large don’t create new spending. Instead, they shift existing discretionary spending from one part of a regional economy to another, experts say 
“The empirical evidence shows repeatedly that stadium subsidies fail to generate new tax revenue and new jobs or attract new businesses,” the Tax Foundation said in an October report. “While attending a sporting event or a concert in a new, publicly subsidized venue might benefit fans of the team or those who attend the event, those subsidies shift spending that would have occurred in other parts of the city or state in the absence of a new sports stadium or arena.”
Meanwhile, by developing intellectual capital, public education provides multifaceted benefits to the economy, experts say.
“Research shows that individuals who graduate and have access to quality education throughout primary and secondary school are more likely to find gainful employment, have stable families, and be active and productive citizens,” Dana Mitra of Pennsylvania State University said in a research report. “They are also less likely to commit serious crimes, less likely to place high demands on the public health care system, and less likely to be enrolled in welfare assistance programs.” 
However that may be, the Ohio House budget would slash funding for public education far below what’s called for under a 2021 plan to make it sufficient to meet the requirements of the Ohio Constitution. 
The Fair School Funding Plan calls for $666 million in new spending on public education. The Republican House budget would provide only $226 million.

(Photo from Akron Police body camera footage.)Ohio activists are starting to gather signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would end qualified immunity — a protection for police and other government officials that prevents citizens from suing them.
When an Akron police officer caused an accident that crushed four cars, Steven Rockich expected some sort of remedy.
“I could not believe my eyes, man, I was like what the heck?” Rockich said, evaluating the damage.
But he didn’t get it.
He told us in January that even though the officer was found liable for causing the damage, he would be the one paying the price.
“The towing that I had to pay out-of-pocket was over $600, and then my car was worth over $5,000, so it’s all out the window — just smashed,” Rockich said.
State law prevents government officials from being held liable for civil damages unless the victim can prove that the officer violated their constitutional rights, which activist Marije Rivers explained is an uphill battle.
“It’s hard to prove that exact, because you would initially need full evidence, with redactions, with opinions, with point of views, audio,” Rivers said. “It’s so hard to get it exactly right.”
This is why she is collecting signatures for the Ohio Coalition to End Qualified Immunity — and is working to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal would take away this protection and allow victims to sue for damages.

WEWS investigators found thousands of at-fault crashes by emergency vehicles piling up across the state during the past five years.
But Ohio Fraternal Order of Police President Jay McDonald argued that this is necessary to shield officers who are just trying to do their jobs.
“If I am worried about whether or not I’m going to get sued and lose my house and put my family at risk, then I’m also going to be worried about whether I should proactively police that neighborhood,” McDonald said.
But when it comes to car crash damage, we asked who should pay for it.
“Well, right now there’s existing frameworks to pay for that,” he responded. “We don’t need a complete expansion of litigation rights that could cause taxes to go up, could cause cops to cease working in this profession.”
Rivers said current legal remedies tend to be ineffective.
“The city will fund and insure what they want to fund and insure,” she said.
But this won’t just hurt police, McDonald warned.
“This impacts children’s services workers, teachers, custodial people at schools,” he said. “We’re exposing the lunch lady at your local elementary school to litigation that doesn’t exist today.”
Attorney General Dave Yost has also been fighting against the amendment, but recently, a federal court forced him to approve the petition, so that Rivers and others can start collecting the about 415,000 signatures needed by early July.
Until then, Rockich is footing the bill.
“They said that they’re not going to pay anything for what just happened because it’s full immunity,” he said.
Activists are trying to get it on the November ballot.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)Lace up your court shoes because April is National Pickleball Month. It’s also — apparently — National Afternoon Tea Month, National Brunch Month and National Canine Fitness Month.
So maybe you should be playing pickleball with Fido before a brunch date and afternoon tea?
Today I am petitioning for a new designation for April: it’s National School Statistics Month.
This is the time of the year when educational statistics and rankings scream for our attention. For our uniquely American media that rank schools against each other, it’s also the moment to pit business schools against each other and even teachers against each other.
As Fido knows, it’s a dog eat dog world.
In the upcoming days, high school seniors who have been accepted at a few different universities will choose their home for next year. They will consider the rank of one school against another: “Should I go to the No. 159 school in the nation because they are providing a greater scholarship than the No. 102 school in the nation?”
Meanwhile, rising juniors and seniors in high school are consulting rankings and lists to map out their college visits this summer and fall.
The most popular months for parents to move houses, according to multiple moving companies, are during the summer. (Welcome to National Moving Month in a few days when May begins!) Parents will be consulting school rankings, graduation rates and student-teacher ratios. Choosing a new neighborhood is really about choosing the best neighborhood elementary school.
April is also a common month for students choosing a course schedule for next fall. While some college students choose classes based on personal or professional interests, they also are scouting the professors and teachers who typically teach each course. Who gives the most homework? Whose class would you take again?
The internet will give you those answers too.
The trouble with all of these rankings, as they compare schools who are wildly different, is the air of certainty that they promise. Consider the statistical precision offered by certifying one high school as the No. 1 school over a No. 2 school. Let alone — gasp! — a No. 7 school.
Even with the many algorithms, reviews and databases that ranking services promise to employ, the rankings are often misleading.
 
RateMyProfessors.com
College instructors share a queasy feeling when this website gets mentioned. Those who are bold enough to log on to RateMyProfessors.com quickly get the feeling that they are a plate of fries being reviewed on Yelp! (“Too salty indeed!”)
What insights does RateMyProfessors.com provide from University of Kansas students who previously took my courses?

3 out of 5 for quality, 3 out of 5 for difficulty: “Eric Thomas was a good but not great professor. Had some meh moments but also some fun ones.”
5 out of 5 for quality, 2 out of 5 for difficulty: “MY KING. its (sic) a big class and you get put in a random group and that group will grade you at the end of the quarter but most of you (sic) grade is daily group class work and tests. GREAT GUY”
4 out of 5 for quality, 4 out of 5 for difficulty: “Hes (sic) alright”

Clearly, I need to teach a bit more grammar. And need to elevate my “meh” energy.
Yesterday during office hours, a student told me she had been unsure about registering for my class. In the end, she said she signed up for it only after scrolling those RateMyProfessors.com reviews. I’m wondering which glowing (or angry) review hooked her.
The website provides a preposterous sample, of course. After teaching more than 2,000 students during 11 years at KU, 43 have left these curt reviews summing up 16 weeks in my class with a few syllables.
I can’t argue that students should trust other students because they often have smart observations. But as any instructor knows, the students who drench you in feedback are usually the A+ achievers who loved your class, or the students who failed and see the rating as a chance to exact revenge.
Hence, a 2023 review of me: “When you talk to him in private, he could not possibly care less about you.” Ouch.
We can be grateful for the progress that RateMyProfessors.com no longer uses “hotness” as a part of their rating system. For years, students used the site’s infamous chili pepper to rate the attractiveness and wardrobe of their instructors. Thankfully, that yucky metric fell away in 2018.
And yes, I did try to use the Wayback Machine to see if I could recall how many chili peppers I had earned. But alas, that metric is lost. (And yes, my vanity score just skyrocketed. How many mirrors did I earn?)
 
Niche.com rankings
This week, the Kansas City Star relayed rankings from the educational website Niche. The headline promises empirical certainty: “These 15 high schools are some of the highest ranked in the KC area for 2025.”
The results are summarized with the top 10 overall schools, according to the website, which boasts: “Niche has the most comprehensive data on U.S. schools and neighborhoods. We rigorously analyze dozens of public data sets and over 100 million reviews and survey responses to help you understand what a place is really like.”
I am not convinced. The data are opaque to visitors. Average ACT and SAT test scores are reported — but it’s unclear when students achieved these scores. The website summarizes the “Culture & Safety” of some schools with as few as 10 survey responses for a particular school. To trust a website like this — and report its findings as fact — demands more transparency.
Whether you trust them or not, the rankings tout suburban schools that hug the Kansas-Missouri state line as being the 10 best. Half of the schools are private and charge more than $15,000 per year. It’s a mash-up of schools from affluent areas charging more than $50,000 for a high school education. They should be good.
That being said, I have personally visited each of these schools, and they are excellent — but in totally different ways. It’s laughable to rank them, from a private high school with fewer than 200 students to a public high school with more than 1,700 students, this bluntly.
 
College rankings
U.S. News and World Report invented both the folly and fortune of these college rankings. Each September, their rankings trumpet the best universities in the nation while dunking on others. (Today’s teens shopping for colleges aren’t likely to know that U.S. News and World Report was once a magazine you saw many places, but mostly in doctor’s and dentist’s offices.)
Other publications have responded with rankings to rival and mock the lists from U.S. News and World Report. In its 20th year, Washington Monthly released its rankings, calling them “our answer to U.S. News and World Report, which relies on crude and easily manipulated measures of wealth, exclusivity, and prestige. We rank liberal arts colleges — four-year institutions that award almost exclusively bachelor’s degrees and that focus on arts and sciences rather than professional programs — based on their contribution to the public good.”
The numbers are right there, as transparent as we readers would hope. And the mission is precise. Rather than trying to summarize the entirety of a university, the staff hopes to evaluate “social mobility, research, and promoting public service.”
If those are your values, the rankings suggest, these are your metrics.
Washington Monthly goes further, providing even more specific rankings, “America’s Best and Worst Colleges for Women in STEM.” According to the rankings, Fort Hays State University is the second worst in the country in graduating women with a chemistry degree and 10th worst in graduating women with a biology degree. Wichita State’s electrical engineering ranks near the bottom of that discipline with only 8.6 of graduates who are female. I wish that I could report that any Kansas schools achieved spots on the “best” list.
The ruthlessly narrow goal of these rankings is admirable. Washington Monthly is saying: “We will put a specific band of statistics in context for you. We can’t tell you everything about a university, but you can trust us on this.” The publication’s humility and focus are rare in the business of publishing educational rankings. 
It’s hard to be humble when everyone wants to be No. 1.

(Stock photo from Getty Images)More than 50 years ago, the Ohio Environmental Council was formed by a group of ordinary Ohioans. Their motivation? Making sure events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire never happened again. 
Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its state-level counterpart, the Ohio EPA, Ohio’s water resources were under serious threat. It was so filled with industrial pollutants, the Cuyahoga River — a body of water — caught fire, not once, but multiple times during the 1960s. During this same time period, Ohio’s Great Lake Erie was declared dead. 
Our air quality wasn’t much better. The air quality in Youngstown, Cleveland, and Steubenville was among the worst in the nation. Industrial waste was dumped on private property, while even more ended up in poorly lined dumpsites, contaminating our soil and leaching into groundwater. Fifty years ago, our national bird, the bald eagle, was on the verge of extinction.
In 1970, Richard Nixon established the U.S. EPA with a mission to clean up pollution, establish environmental standards and regulations, and develop policies for protecting the environment. 
Today, we enjoy markedly better air quality than we did fifty years ago. People row and fish in our state’s lakes and rivers. We’ve cleaned up many industrial brownfields and former mine sites. We’ve adopted highways and raised awareness about the importance of litter prevention. Bald eagles are routinely spotted nesting in counties around the state. The days of private landowners uncovering barrels of toxic sludge in their backyards are long gone.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Or are they? 
According to U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, “‘President Trump has been very outspoken about his desire for Americans to be able to access clean air and clean water. We want air, land, water to be cleaner, safer, healthier.” 
And yet, at the same time, Zeldin has announced a sweeping plan to allow far more heavy metals and toxins into the air from power plants, relax rules prohibiting mercury and arsenic from getting into our drinking water, and make it harder for neighborhoods downwind, or downstream of pollution to do anything about it.
We are old enough to remember an Ohio where bald eagle sightings were rare. Where children weren’t allowed to swim in or even touch lake waters. And where smog, haze and air quality alerts were the norm and not the exception. Without the federal government’s oversight of polluters, we risk those days returning.
In the absence of federal support, Ohio’s state and local government agencies will have to pick up the slack. Do we have the resources to tackle this enormous challenge?
We pay taxes so our government will provide the basic services and protections we need to keep our communities safe, healthy, and livable. Without the US EPA upholding its end of the bargain, it’s hard to see how we’re going to protect the progress Ohioans fought so hard to make.
Ohioans deserve better than a return to the bad old days of pollution.

(Courtesy of National Medical Association)Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.










It's not just health insurance. It's a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro


Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
 Bias and language barriers

Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
 ‘Ripple effect’

Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

She and the lawmakers urged the immediate return of her husband from a maximum security prison in El Salvador. (Photo by Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)As the whole world is now aware, on March 12, 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; three days later, he was sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). While the Trump administration initially stated that Mr. Garcia’s removal to El Salvador was an administrative error, it now alleges that Garcia was a member of MS-13 to justify his removal.
Mr. Garcia was sent to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order that barred the U.S. from deporting him to that country, based on a finding that he would be persecuted if returned there. He was sent to El Salvador without receiving any form of due process prior to his removal. And he was sent to El Salvador despite his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura’s pleas that he be returned to her and their children.
Now reports have emerged that in 2021, Ms. Sura filed for a protective order against Mr. Garcia. A protective order is a civil remedy that enables a court to order that a person not assault, threaten, harass, or otherwise abuse the person who has requested the order, with whom that person generally has a familial or intimate relationship.
The protective order can also put into place a number of other conditions designed to foster safety for a person who has been abused by an intimate partner or family member, including requirements that a person have no contact with and stay away from another’s home, school, or workplace. In Maryland, the issuance of a final order of protection requires either that the person alleged to have done harm agrees to the order or that a judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that abuse has occurred.

Views of writers are their own.




What Ms. Sura received, however, was a temporary protective order. Temporary orders are emergency measures put into place to provide safety until such time as a final hearing can be held. Temporary protective orders require less proof than final protective.
A court must find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that abuse has occurred. That order can be issued based on the testimony of the person who has been harmed and any supporting evidence they might have. Temporary orders are ex parte orders—only one side appears at the hearing.
There has never been a final contested hearing on the allegations raised by Ms. Sura because Ms. Sura — like many people subjected to abuse — chose not to pursue the final order.  Ms. Sura has subsequently said that she and Mr. Garcia were able to address their issues through counseling and that their marriage grew stronger as a result.
The Trump administration has used Ms. Sura’s protective order filing to undermine her claim that Mr. Garcia is a good man, a loving father. The protective order case has become a smoke screen to deflect attention from the administration’s blatantly illegal actions.
The administration’s actions will almost certainly dissuade people from seeking protective orders. Immigrant victims of violence are already reluctant to seek protective orders for fear of the impact on their partners and their families. Knowing that your partner could disappear into a prison that has been described as a “gulag,” a prison that is well known for torture and inhumane conditions, will prevent people from asking for protection that they may desperately need.
A temporary protective order is not grounds for deportation. Even a final protective order, entered after a contested hearing and a judge’s ruling that abuse has occurred, is not grounds for deportation. Nothing about Ms. Sura’s request for assistance from the court justifies the administration’s actions.
Intimate partner violence is frequently used as a justification for regressive carceral policies. Concerns about domestic violence have been used to justify opposition to bail reform and discovery reform in New York and sentencing reform in Maryland and Oklahoma.
The anti-domestic violence movement has recognized its contribution to the rise of mass incarceration and the disproportionate impact mass incarceration has on communities of color. Left unchallenged, Mr. Garcia’s removal becomes another example of how the anti-violence movement has allowed domestic violence to be co-opted in the name of punishment and persecution.
The failure of the anti-violence movement to stand up for the rule of law in this case will further embolden those who use the anti-violence movement to serve their own ends.
The Trump administration hopes that the domestic violence allegations against Mr. Garcia will divert us from the illegality of their actions. We should not be diverted. And the anti-violence movement should say so.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5508-e1744228152867.jpg,,,2025-04-25 05:00:27.117092
,California,2025-04-25 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"As Harris ponders run for California governor, is she prepared for the daunting job?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/kamala-harris-california-governor-run/,"California's future governor will have to deal with its housing shortage, homelessness, poverty, uncertain water supply, educational deficiencies and budget deficits.","A couple of weeks ago, Kamala Harris got the full New York Times treatment — a lengthy article speculating whether she would run for governor of California next year or prepare for another shot at the White House in 2028.
As the Times is wont to do, the piece was full of quotes and suppositions from anonymous sources.
“Interviews with more than three dozen of Ms. Harris’s advisers, former aides, allies and friends reveal a politician — known, as much as anything, for her caution — standing at perhaps her most fateful crossroads yet,” the Times said in a piece with four bylines.
“After 22 years as an elected official, she must decide whether, or how, to continue her political career in an environment that was remade by her defeat.
“Some Harris aides believe she would automatically be the front-runner in a crowded primary field, thanks to her name recognition and wide network of donors and supporters.
“But many more Democrats argue against another Harris-for-President bid: The 2028 election will be a contest for the party’s future in which she would be perceived as a figure of the past, the reasoning goes. Others say Democrats will not nominate another woman, fearing the country is too sexist for her to win.”
The article more or less pointed to a gubernatorial run rather than waiting for 2028.
“Ms. Harris has good reason for leaning toward a run for governor, according to people who have spoken with her,” the Times said. “She has watched with horror as institutions Democrats care about — universities, law firms and more — have caved under pressure. And she believes that as governor of the nation’s most populous blue state, she would have a powerful platform from which to push back against Mr. Trump and his policies, and to defend Democratic priorities and values.”
There are two things wrong with the article.
The first is that it cast Harris’ situation almost entirely in terms of advancing her political career, an example of political journalism’s tendency to cover politics as something like reporting on sports events — who’s winning, who’s losing, who’s up and who’s down — rather than a prelude to governance.
That approach, while appealing to political junkies, completely ignores the issues that a politician might face if he or she is fortunate enough to be elected. In this case, the Times implied that the 2026 election for a governor who would lead the world’s fourth-largest economy is just about opposition to Donald Trump and nothing else.
The article contained not one sentence about the California issues Harris would inherit from Gavin Newsom were she to become governor — such thorny matters as a perpetual housing shortage, homelessness, poverty, an uncertain water supply, educational deficiencies and chronic state budget deficits.

Commentary 
As Democratic candidates for governor increase, they wait for Harris to decide 

by Dan Walters 





Having ignored those issues, all of which predate Trump, the Times article’s second deficiency is that it contained nothing about Harris’ abilities, or lack thereof, to confront them. And there is good reason to doubt whether she would be up to the job.
During her climb up the political ladder, Harris’ record was mixed — at best.  As the state’s attorney general she was best known for tightly orchestrated media events rather than substantive action. She even ducked the Capitol’s debates about changing the criminal justice system.
As a senator she authored no noteworthy legislation, not even on California-centered matters, while the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein steadfastly carried the state’s political water. Harris’ campaign for president in 2020 was a disaster, and after being chosen as Joe Biden’s running mate she did little of note as vice president.
Governing an extremely complex state such as California is a daunting task, as any past governor could attest, not a consolation prize for losing a presidential contest.

Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton - the architect of the House budget - prepares to present the spending plan to the House on April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The majority of Statehouse Democrats opposed the 2025 budget — crafted over four months and passed by Republicans early Friday morning — decrying unvetted last-minute additions and cuts.
For chief House budget architect Rep. Jeff Thompson, the budget was one that “lives within our means” following a grim financial forecast the week before.
House Speaker Todd Huston gave a robust defense — and rare floor appearance — in favor of the legislation after nearly two hours of debate.

“This budget does so much. It continues to invest in K-12 education in every way. Even with a surprise shortfall in revenue, we made sure we protected K-12 and we did that,” said Huston, R-Fishers. “… House Bill 1001 builds on … what’s taking place in Indiana. It builds on that success. When we see a challenge — and when we get a challenge — we meet it and we excel through it.” 
Democrats largely opposed the measure, citing the lack of funds for child care and Medicaid waiver waitlists while wealthy Hoosiers get tax dollars to send their children to private schools.
“This budget doesn’t just keep our government running, it impacts the real people — the Hoosiers — that are depending on us. They’re counting on us to pass a budget that, yes, will get balanced. But, more importantly, one that reflects their needs and values,” said Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton. “… Unfortunately, this budget falls short of that.”
Included in the last version of the budget is an expansion of school choice voucher eligibility, meaning that even families earning more than $220,000 — an estimated 3,000 students — will qualify.
One member from each party crossed caucus lines in the House, but it moved out of the chamber on a 66-27 vote. 
The bill fared roughly the same in the Senate, where two Republicans voted against the proposal but one Democrat supported it, for a final vote of 39-11. 
It now moves to Gov. Mike Braun for his signature. 
 Democrats lament funding shortfalls

The budget didn’t only impact K-12 education, but also the state’s various higher education institutions.
Rep. Matt Pierce, a Democrat from Bloomington, railed against last-minute language, slipped in without public testimony, that would give Braun complete control over the Indiana University Board of Trustees. 
Other provisions would require reviews of tenured professors for productivity and publicly posted syllabi. 
“April 24, 2025, is a date that will live in infamy,” said Pierce, who is employed by IU. “The faculty of our state universities were suddenly and deliberately attacked by the Republican supermajority.”

Rep. Chris Campbell highlighted another $1 million budget cut to a housing first program. Those dollars caused homelessness rates to drop by 14% in 2017, she said. 
“Without this program our communities rely on to assist the unhoused, we should expect homelessness to not only continue but to likely increase,” said the West Lafayette Democrat. “I don’t understand how a legislature that has spent a lot of this session trying to criminalize homelessness is now trying to eliminate the one tool we have been using since 2017.”
The latter portion refers to an effort that would crack down on homelessness by making “street camping” on public property a crime. That language appeared in a handful of different bills but didn’t cross the finish line before the legislators left Indianapolis. 
Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, criticized the elimination of public broadcasting and trails funding. She said she would have supported cuts to the line items in light of the state’s finances, but “zeroing out these programs is a mistake that tells us they may never come back.”
But the narrowed eligibility for subsidized child care would make the shortage of options for parents worse, not better, she said. 
“We can’t afford to make that cut in this budget. This is actually, exactly the moment we should be stepping up our investment in child care. Or, at least maintaining it,” she said. “But, instead, this budget steps back, choosing to invest in the wealthiest who don’t need it instead of those who do.”
In response to Democratic concerns in the Senate, Sen. Ryan Misher, the bill’s sponsor, said the measure builds for the future.
“I know there’s really no one going home feeling like they had a big win here — not a year that anybody would feel like it’s a big win,” concluded the Mishawaka Republican. “I think the best way to look at it is that it could have been much worse.”
 Republicans add their concerns

While no House Republicans other than Thompson and Huston spoke on the budget, a handful of Senate Republicans chimed in — including two with several qualms.
Sen. Mike Young criticized his fellow Republicans for adding “14 pieces of language that have nothing to do with the budget,” including language on carbon sequestration. He also bemoaned individual line item increases while taxes on gas continue to grow. 

“There’s all kinds of things in this current budget,” said Young. “… I think I would’ve looked at more of the cutting than I would about more of the spending which they did.”
Additionally, cigarette taxes will increase by $2 per pack, with proportional increases for other forms of tobacco. Those dollars will bring in an estimated $850 million in the next biennium.
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, said he was struggling to support that tax increase but focused on the positives.
“There’s too much good in there to not vote for this budget,” he said.
While Young voted against the measure, Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, supported it — despite her reservations.
“We don’t have enough money for health care and for Medicaid, but we can give a millionaire a voucher to send their kids to private school. It’s unconscionable,” said Becker. “… But the biggest thing I’m disappointed in is the Dolly Parton Imagination Library and the fact that we didn’t fund it.”
That line item was $6 million in the last budget cycle. First Lady Maureen Braun has vowed to raise those funds.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA federal judge in Atlanta is set to rule on a complaint filed by a group of 133 international college students who say the administration of President Donald Trump illegally and capriciously tried to take away their ability to study in the United States.
Following a Thursday hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert said she will decide by the end of the month whether to issue a ruling protecting the students, who include 26 Georgia students studying at schools including the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University and Emory University.
Last week, Calvert issued a 14-day temporary order allowing the students to keep studying.
The students say they were not given any warning before being cut off from their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System records, or SEVIS, which is maintained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and allows them to continue studying in the states.
The students say ICE did not tell them why their SEVIS statuses were revoked, but many suspect it was in relation to minor run-ins with law enforcement in the states, sometimes years ago. Many of the students report misdemeanor charges including public intoxication or reckless driving. Attorneys for the students say none of them have been accused of any crime that could result in SEVIS suspension under ICE’s own rules.
Much of Thursday’s arguments dealt with whether Calvert’s court is the right venue to deal with the plaintiffs who are not studying in Georgia.
Attorney David Powell with the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued that each plaintiff has unique circumstances and their cases should be heard separately.
Attorney Charles Kuck, representing the students, said it makes sense for the students to join their cases together because they all faced the same issue: the unexpected revocation of their SEVIS records.
Kuck said his office has heard from nearly 700 people from across the country not currently involved in the case but in similar situations as his clients and plans to file a class action lawsuit in the coming days.
Kuck said there are at least 40 lawsuits pending across the country and at least 17 other courts have put temporary orders into place like the one Calvert issued last week.
“When you think about it, there’s anywhere from 4,000 to 5,000, maybe 7,000 of these students,” he said to reporters outside the courthouse after the hearing. “Do the courts and U.S. attorneys really want to defend 7,000 lawsuits? They’re going to lose every single one of them, because the things we talked about today weren’t about the individuals, they were about the group. And, clearly, the individual is going to be protected in this. So we’re going to bring a class action and try to protect the whole group.”

Unlike any budget year in memory, they are doing so in the context of the threat of unprecedented federal funding cuts and a shaky economy that could have a devastating impact on people across Connecticut, including on the community nonprofits that serve the most vulnerable in our state.
It’s understandable that some believe the current climate means the state should dig in, backfill federal cuts only and protect the reserves we have. But there are two good reasons that make this the right time to go a step further and make investments in health and human service programs that help Connecticut’s people keep their heads above water and healthy.

Gian Carl Casa
First, after more than a decade of underfunding, nonprofit community programs are already closing and waiting lists are growing. Federal cuts would exacerbate an existing crisis, turning it into disaster for thousands of people here.
And to be clear, community nonprofits are not charities. They are highly skilled organizations that contract with the state to provide vital services, including mental health and addiction treatment, day and residential programs for people with disabilities, shelter for families, and support for skill training and job search for people leaving incarceration.
Second, if the economy slows and heads towards recession, the needs of residents will go up;  recessions are when services are most needed.  Fears of a recession should not mean Connecticut holds off on spending on programs that serve our most vulnerable people. A failure to invest in community nonprofits will limit access to vital services.
Today there is more than $4 billion in Connecticut’s “Rainy Day Fund.”  A projected surplus this fiscal year of $1.8 billion will bring the total to more than $6 billion.  It’s time to use those taxpayer funds to support programs that support Connecticut’s residents. This isn’t just a rainy day – it’s already storming and federal cuts would make it a monsoon.
Our state has a bipartisan history of caring. We appreciate that all sides of the budget discussions are looking for the best way to help people. But it is not the time to acquiesce in advance to federal cuts, it is a time to make sure they don’t worsen current problems.
More than a half-million Connecticut residents depend on community nonprofits. Tens of thousands of residents work to serve them.  Our state leaders need to meet the challenges for those vulnerable people by responding to the existing crisis and anticipating any federal spending cuts with investment
Already, the status quo doesn’t meet the need; the situation will be dire if demand for services increases due to a slowing economy.

On April 9, the day the stock market soared following the administration’s announcement that it was pausing the hefty tariffs on dozens of countries around the globe, Ingraham informed her Fox viewers that Trump had just made a “brilliant move,” that he was a genius, and that all of his critics had egg on their faces.
Not to be outdone, Hannity used his Fox platform to refer to Trump’s backing down following one of the largest market meltdowns in years as the “art of the deal” while insisting that it was a huge win for the President and the country.
Never mind that the stock market was still down by thousands of points from just before Trump’s decision to impose the largest tariffs we have seen in decades. Never mind that Trump has launched a trade war with China with no end in sight, a war for which the Eastern superpower seems better prepared to navigate than the United States.
Ingraham and Hannity are apparently not concerned about the reality that millions of Americans close to retirement are down significant sums in their investment accounts. The two Fox anchors seemed oblivious to the fact that most leading economists are predicting higher prices for consumers as a result of Trump’s tariffs and many are warning about the threat of a global recession.
Fox’s evening anchors have betrayed the original slogan of the news channel, which was “fair and balanced” reporting. Many of its news broadcasters like Ingraham and Hannity do not even pretend to be fair and balanced, opting instead to feed their viewers a steady diet of pro-Trump propaganda.
For example, if you were expecting to hear any real critique of the current administration over their handling of the Signal chat breach (in which the editor of the Atlantic Magazine was added to a group chat of Cabinet members that were discussing plans to attack Yemen), you would not find it in the Fox Evening News. Instead, what you got to see was Laura Ingraham interviewing Mike Waltz, the official that had added the reporter to the chat, while the two used this opportunity to trash the Atlantic Magazine editor who disclosed this security breach.
Likewise, if you were hoping to learn why the Trump administration, with the help of DOGE, fired thousands of essential workers from the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, or Veteran Affairs, only to rehire these workers days later, watching Hannity’s program on Fox will not help you. With Hannity, you are more likely to get a softball interview of Trump and Musk in which the host heaps praise on the two men.

For years now, Ingraham and Hannity have echoed the Trump mantra that immigrants are invading and taking over our country even though the evidence does not support this claim. The two Fox anchors never bothered to contradict Trump and Vance during the 2024 Presidential election cycle when they made the outrageous allegation that Haitian migrants living in Springfield Ohio were eating the dogs of that community. By serving as proxies for the Trump administration, Ingraham and Hannity use their nightly shows to misinform their millions of viewers and insult their intelligence.
We should not fault Ingraham and Hannity or the Fox media corporation for offering their viewers a conservative angle on the news of the day. Most media outlets bring a particular perspective and value system to bear on the issues they cover and how they choose to tell their stories.
However, in a democratic society, the press and, media in general, are expected to report on the facts and convey to its readers and viewers accurate information. More than that, good media is supposed to hold the government accountable for its decisions and actions, which is why we refer to the media as the fourth branch of government.
Ingraham and Hannity long ago abandoned the mission of a free and robust media in a democratic society for the sake of operating as lackeys and cheerleaders for President Trump. Whether they are doing this to curry favor with Trump, to raise the ratings of the Fox network, or to benefit themselves financially is not important. 
What is critical to understand is that in functioning as the President’s poodles they have betrayed their responsibility to their audience, to the profession of journalism, as well as to our democracy.

The numbers speak for themselves.
A multi-billion-dollar boost to the economy
A 10,000-seat stadium that would be home to Connecticut’s MLS NEXT Pro soccer team, a planned National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) team, and a venue for year-round entertainment, is the anchor that makes this entire vision possible. Without it, the surrounding (much larger) investments in housing, retail, and public spaces will not materialize.

The development would be one of the largest capital projects in Connecticut’s history, with nearly three-fourths of funding coming from private sources. Total economic impact is projected to reach $2.2 billion, sustaining nearly 700 new full-time jobs annually on average. This isn’t speculation – it’s a data-driven projection of how large-scale, mixed-use developments can drive prosperity. 
Beyond job creation, the financial returns to the state and local governments are undeniable. The CCEA analysis projects generation of $600 million in incremental tax revenue, far exceeding the level of public investment. In a time when Connecticut is seeking sustainable revenue sources without burdening taxpayers, this development represents a win-win scenario. 
An alternative scenario featuring a 22,500-seat stadium that would host a top-tier men’s Major League Soccer (MLS) team and an NWSL team remains on the table. Total economic impact increases to $3.4 billion with the larger stadium, with over 1,300 new jobs added annually and over $1 billion in new tax revenue.
Critically, the rapidly growing engagement with and excitement around soccer would draw thousands from across the region including from neighboring states to Bridgeport and Connecticut. That dynamic will deliver benefits well beyond what the CCEA study can fully capture. 
A mixed-use vision that solves pressing challenges 
At its core, this project is about building a vibrant, interconnected, welcoming community. With over 1,000 new apartment units, the development directly addresses Connecticut’s housing shortage, providing modern living spaces – including affordable live-work units – in a transit-friendly location. A four-star hotel will attract visitors and boost tourism revenue, while the retail and dining spaces will offer new opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs. 
The inclusion of a public park and riverwalk ensures that this project benefits everyone, not just those who live or work nearby. By aligning with the broader Trust for the Public Land’s 20-mile shoreline pathway project, the project is making a long-term investment in walkability, health, recreation, and environmental stewardship. 
Catalyst for additional investment  
The chosen site – currently a neglected, underutilized area – represents an opportunity to connect Bridgeport’s waterfront with its downtown core, raising property values and drawing new investment. With direct access to the train station, ferry terminal, major highways and bus routes, the development will serve as an accessible destination for residents throughout Connecticut and neighboring states, boosting quality of life. 
It will also serve as a highly visible symbol of a resurgent, reimagined Connecticut; a clear signal to investors, businesses, and residents that Connecticut is ready to compete. It’s a chance to move beyond outdated perceptions and embrace a modern vision for economic growth and community engagement. 
Metro markets across the country have leveraged sports-anchored mixed-use developments to reinvigorate urban centers, enhance their visibility, attract businesses, and cultivate a sense of local pride. Connecticut needs development like this to assert itself as a dynamic market unto itself – a place where people want to live, work and play – not just a drive-thru state connecting New York and Boston. This development would make Connecticut nationally visible and invigorate its image. 
Defining moment for Connecticut 
This development is not just another construction project – it’s a moment for redefining Connecticut’s future. The economic case is clear: billions in impact, thousands of jobs, and hundreds of millions in new revenue. The social and cultural benefits are equally compelling: improved housing, vibrant public spaces, and a premier sports venue that will put Connecticut on the map. 
As policymakers and the public weigh this opportunity, I urge them to consider what’s at stake. This development is a necessary investment in Connecticut’s long-term success. Uncertainty at the national level only underscores the importance of this project to Connecticut’s economy. Now is the time to be bold, to embrace growth, and to make this transformative vision a reality.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Lawmakers in the Washington state House advanced a bill addressing student and parental rights on Thursday, clearing the way for it to reach the governor’s desk. 
Debate around the bill has been some of the most divisive of this year’s session. The legislation largely stems from a citizen initiative lawmakers approved last year that granted certain rights to parents of public school students under age 18. This included the ability for parents to easily access school materials, such as textbooks, curriculum, and their child’s medical records. 
When Democrats agreed to pass that initiative, they said they would revisit it if it clashed with other state and federal laws. That’s what they said this year’s legislation was about. 
“​​It is creating a lot of confusion for parents, for educators, for the local school directors, all of whom are trying to independently interpret the law; that is a recipe for disaster,” said Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, D-Seattle, who chairs the House Education Committee. 
House Bill 1296 passed on a 59-39, party-line vote. 
“This bill creates that clarity to make sure that it’s not just some voices, but all voices are heard,” said Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, has not publicly taken a position on the bill.
On Thursday, when Democrats denied a Republican motion to invalidate changes made in the Senate, one Republican lawmaker rose to shout at the speaker presiding over the chamber, Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton. 
“Not only do you take rules and break them,” yelled Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, without being called upon. “You break your own rules!”
The sudden disruption derailed progress on the bill for hours. Dufault was not present in the chamber for the ensuing floor debate on the bill and participated virtually instead. And there was an increased Washington State Patrol presence in the House. 
Republicans have hammered the Democratic effort throughout the session, framing it as a strategy to gut the initiative.
“Parents are afraid,” said Rep. Deb Manjarrez, R-Wapato.
“They didn’t want information to be kept from them about their child, I don’t want information kept from me about my child,” she said.
The bill includes language around gender issues and diversity, equity and inclusion. Republicans previously introduced unsuccessful amendments to prevent transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports and entering girls’ locker rooms.  
Under the legislation, a new complaint process would be established, and the bill directs the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to investigate complaints from students, parents, and others if schools fail to comply with state laws in areas like civil rights, nondiscrimination, harassment, and the physical restraint or isolation of students. 
The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction would have to take numerous steps to intervene, with the consequences for school officials and districts becoming more severe in cases where they are found to be willfully disobeying state law. 
As a last resort, the office could withhold up to 20% of a district’s state funds and redirect that money toward resolving the issues the state has identified.  
Republicans claim this will take control away from local school districts and is too punitive toward schools.
The bill itself states: “Local control is not absolute and must also be balanced against the need to ensure all students have access to a healthy, safe learning environment that celebrates and protects their diversity and civil rights.”
School districts could not terminate, demote, suspend, or take any other negative action against a school employee for supporting students exercising their legal rights or for teaching about historically marginalized and underrepresented groups. 
Nine specific student rights are also outlined, such as the right to receive an education in a safe and supportive learning environment, free of harassment and bullying. The bill makes it clear that students are free to exercise constitutionally protected rights at school.
It also directs schools to develop promotional materials that incorporate these rights and make this information widely accessible to all students. 
The legislation keeps parts of the initiative that allow parents to review school curriculum and textbooks, and require school districts to “immediately” notify parents if a student is a victim of abuse, sexual misconduct, or assault. 
It would enable parents to opt their child out of any survey, analysis, or evaluation regarding political affiliations, sexual behavior, religious practices, and more. 
New parental rights would also be added, including ones for parents to be notified of their child’s unexcused absences and to engage in efforts to reduce those absences and to request information about special education programs and determine eligibility. 
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, disagreed with Republicans’ criticisms. “While it may have been said that this bill guts parental rights that were passed from the initiative,” she said, “I believe this bill extends parental rights to more parents.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1586-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-25 00:02:35.029750

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)One-hundred-and-seven days after the General Assembly convened, this year’s legislative session came to a close early Friday morning after a marathon day at the Statehouse.
Dozens of bills sprinted across the finish line in the final days — and hours — before the sine die gavel strike brought policymaking business to a close.
Thursday alone saw more than two dozen proposals sent to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
And although the next state two-year state budget was the highlight of the night, debate swirled around other major bills, too, including those dealing with education “deregulation,” pharmaceutical pricing and public retiree bonuses.
Lawmakers also compromised on measures to connect Hoosiers to broadband; curb local energy project moratoriums; address K-12 chronic absenteeism; reinstate an A-F school grading system; and create separate bans on marijuana advertising and lab-cultivated meat.
Final education bills add — and delete — rules for schools
Tensions rose in the Senate before the chamber voted, barely, to send a Republican-backed education “deregulation” measure to the governor.
Heated debate on House Enrolled Act 1002 centered around last-minute conference committee changes, which included a dozen new code repeals. 
Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, was displeased with the rush to approve a long bill with new language.
“I can’t be in the dang room because I don’t know what’s in it,” Young said.

After the extremely narrow 27-21 vote, he approached the floor mic again — this time raising his voice.
“This is bull crap. You’ve got a 116-page bill. You’ve got 30 minutes to read it. We should have more time than that,” said Young, the only senator to refrain from voting. Twelve of his GOP colleagues cast unfavorable votes alongside Democrats. That’s after the House voted the bill out 61-25.
“I am so mad about this,” Young continued. “Our one job is to do what’s right for our constituents, and we can’t do it if we don’t have a chance to read the dang bill.”
Democrats, including Indianapolis Sen. Andrea Hunley, agreed that the bill required “a little bit more scrutiny.”
She referenced a repealed requirement for charter schools to publish economic interest statements. Also removed was an existing requirement for administrators to contact employment references before hiring teachers or other school personnel.
Despite its length, the legislation will strike multiple sections of current state education code.










This is bull crap. You've got a 116-page bill. You've got 30 minutes to read it. We should have more time than that.


– Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis


Examples include the removal of dozens of “may” provisions, eliminating specific COVID-19 pandemic requirements and striking duplicate code. Republican bill author Rep. Bob Behning estimated that the cuts would reduce state education regulations by nearly 10%.
There were bipartisan concerns earlier in the session about the bill’s deletion of existing requirements for teachers to complete training in social and emotional learning (SEL) trauma-informed care and cultural competency.
Some of that language was added back in the final version to ensure teachers are prepared to “(support) students who have experienced trauma that may interfere with a student’s academic functioning.”
Other legislation to further address widespread chronic school absences among Hoosier students earned mostly bipartisan support in both chambers; an 84-8 vote in the House and a 48-2 in the Senate.
Sen. Stacey Donato’s Senate Enrolled Act 482 specifically seeks to beef up the state’s absenteeism statute.
The measure has multiple parts, including a new definition in state code for chronically absent, specified in the bill as missing 10% or more of the school year, regardless of whether it is excused. Another provision allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken. 
A final section of the bill prohibits K-8 students from expulsion “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant. Current law permits students in those grades to be expelled for missing too much school.
Indiana officials say chronic absenteeism rates are improving, but there’s still more work ahead

In the final days of the session, however, a conference committee added language to sunset the expulsion prohibition on July 1, 2026. After that date, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.
The latest attendance numbers released by the Indiana Department of Education last fall reported that 17.8% of K-12 students — roughly 219,00 kids — were “chronically absent” during the most recent 2023-24 school year, meaning they missed at least 18 days.
There was less consensus on a different bill to bring back a statewide letter grade system for Indiana’s K-12 schools. It was sent straight to Braun after a quick 65-25 House vote. 
Earlier this week, lawmakers appeared to disagree on a final draft of House Enrolled Act 1498. Any serious conflicts were quashed behind closed doors; Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, called his measure for a final concurrence vote in the House Thursday evening, signaling a truce with the opposing Senate chamber.
Behning said his bill seeks to put the state education board’s recently unveiled accountability draft — or something like it — into action.
In its final form, the legislation will strip back much of the previous accountability framework and task Indiana’s State Board of Education (SBOE) with building a new A-F rule — that looks beyond just academic performance and graduation rates — by the end of 2025.
Once approved by the governor, a new round of grades will be assigned to Hoosier schools around the start of the 2026-27 academic year.
Although the state board is responsible for hammering out the particulars, the bill does require the new grading system’s methodology to be based on data from the state education department’s existing GPS dashboard and proficiency rates from state assessments, including the IREAD. It also has to prioritize students earning new diploma seals recently approved by the state board.










Yes, we certainly should hold people accountable. We should hold school leaders accountable. We should hold our children accountable. We should hold our parents accountable. But I don't think we should give them a label of an F (to show) that you’re failing.


– Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary


School grades have been effectively suspended since 2018, when Indiana shifted from ISTEP to a new state standardized test and later grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic.
House Democrats “still had a problem” with the final draft, said Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary.
“We do feel like we need to look at our school accountability process, but we don’t feel like we need to hold the Department of Education accountable for using the model of A through F,” he said.
“Yes, we certainly should hold people accountable. We should hold school leaders accountable. We should hold our children accountable. We should hold our parents accountable. But I don’t think we should give them a label of an F (to show) that you’re failing,” Smith continued, saying he preferred an earlier idea to give schools a “need for improvement” designation, rather than a “bad” letter grade. “I just don’t think that we need to do this.”
Crackdowns on energy moratoriums, lab-grown meat and marijuana advertising
A bid to boost Indiana’s electricity supply — by side-stepping often-hostile local zoning authorities — squeaked through to the governor despite opposition from advocates of local control and renewable energy.
A negotiated compromise for Senate Enrolled Act 425 just barely earned the constitutionally required majority of supportive votes during a 51-40 vote in the House. It enjoyed stronger margins in the Senate, with a 31-19 tally.
Under the legislation, the owner of a proposed power plant wouldn’t have to seek any local zoning approval in certain circumstances. But the Senate explicitly excluded solar and wind installations.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said it’s ironic that a small modular nuclear reactor — “which uses radioactive fuel and will generate radioactive waste” — would encounter less local scrutiny than solar panels and wind turbines.
“It’s not consistent with the rhetoric that we hear on this floor all the time about how we are an ‘all the above’ energy state,” Pierce added.

The measure’s House sponsor, Rep. Ed Soliday, has maintained the Senate wouldn’t allow it.
“There was just no hope of putting it back in,” he said Wednesday. “… We went back to them several times and they said ‘no.’”
The eased requirements apply if a project is located on land that already hosts an electric generation facility — even it’s not operational — or a former mine. State regulators would also have to either grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity for construction or decline jurisdiction.
Senate Enrolled Act 425 also aims to stop “abuse” of moratoriums on electric generation projects by local authorities. It caps them to one year and prohibits renewals.
“I’ve seen how moratoriums can be abused,” Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, said Monday.
He argued the “real purpose” of moratorium is to create a “pause” while a local government hurries to adopt an ordinance. But some keep moving the “goal posts.”
“If there’s a certain type of development your jurisdiction does not want, then just say ‘no’ upfront and save all the headache,” Culp said.
Additionally, lab-cultivated meat could soon be banned from production or sale in Indiana for two years with violators to face $10,000 per-day fines.

That’s if Braun approves of House Enrolled Act 1425, which is coming his way after final votes of 74-15 in the House and 43-7.
But a state study of the products’ safety was shelved as lawmakers look to cut spending.
“We were supposed to have a study, I guess to determine what we would do after the moratorium, and apparently the fiscal people said we’re broke, so take the study out,” Pierce said. “So it makes me wonder what we’re going to actually be learning in the next two years.”
The Senate introduced the study and a one-year moratorium following pronounced confusion in that chamber’s committee. In addition to cutting the study, the final version of the legislation extends the moratorium to two years.
In another governor-bound proposal, those advertising marijuana within state lines could face fines of up to $15,000 apiece under a once-inconspicuous agency bill.
Also in the co-opted House Enrolled Act 1390 — originally focused on the Bureau of Motor Vehicles — are contentious regulations for towing and overgrown rural intersections.
The advertising ban would also apply to the rest of Indiana’s Schedule I list of controlled substances. Contracts locked down before the measure’s passage would be exempt. Hoosiers who live around the edges of the state have seen billboards and other advertising pop up because adjoining states have legalized marijuana.
Other provisions would set standards for how law enforcement agencies handle their towing contractors, how much companies can charge for emergency towing, how owners can recover their towed vehicles and more.

Both concepts landed in the final bill draft after being stripped out three weeks ago. In between, they were added to a bill about the sale of utility trailers and then removed.
Lawmakers also folded in a weaker take on a tragedy-sparked push for better sightlines at overgrown, uncontrolled rural intersections. Counties would be able to mow or maintain vegetation in state- or county-owned right-of-way with permission from the Indiana Department of Transportation. The onus was previously on landowners.
The legislation retained plenty of Bureau of Motor Vehicles changes, too.
It would allow the agency to issue electronic registration certificates, requires that toll road operators invoice drivers within a year, caps the amount private driving skills trainers can charge for exams, and more. One other provision allows for real-time electronic insurance verification after accidents. The current system is unwieldy and often results in license suspensions.
It eased through the House in an 81-9 vote, but encountered greater opposition in the Senate’s 31-19 vote.
 Negotiated Senate measures focus on PBMs, ‘squatters’


Large numbers of Hoosiers will now be carved out of a bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Senate Enrolled Act 140 will require insurers and PBMs ensure network adequacy and restricts anticompetitive practices — but Medicaid, managed care organizations and the state employee health plan are all exempt due to concerns about cost increases.
Instead, the issue of contracting under Medicaid and the state employee health plan is punted to an interim study committee — though at least one sponsor said it was “kind of up to debate” whether or not there would be an added cost.

“We don’t have a fully transparent model. So the fact that there could be a fiscal on it — and with this current budget situation — that’s what’s putting the pause on it,” said Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, before a Thursday committee.
A bill seeking to define a “squatter” encountered several hurdles this session, too, with critics concerned about whether vague language would unintentionally harm tenants with informal or unwritten rental agreements.
Under the finalized Senate Enrolled Act 157, law enforcement officers can remove an individual on a property without the permission of the owner within 48 hours, unless there is “credible evidence that the person is not a squatter.”
It would also penalize someone who tries to evict someone who might have a right to the property.
“We don’t want an unscrupulous landlord to be able to use the wrong date or something very simple like that as a means to abuse this part of the code,” said Rep. Joanna King from the floor.
Still, the changes weren’t enough for a handful of lawmakers. Pierce, a Democrat who voted no, previously indicated his doubts that such a law was necessary.
However, it got a unanimous nod in the Senate — its originating chamber — and now goes to the governor.
What’s next for 13th checks, broadband?

Indiana’s public sector retirees are set to get a coveted bonus by October under legislation on its way to Braun — but with a 5% discount.
The thousands of former state and local employees who live off pension benefits that don’t keep up with inflation would’ve gotten nothing after Senate edits. But they would’ve won several years worth of full-amount bonuses through the original version of House Enrolled Act 1221.
“The 5% cut, it’s not what we wanted. One year is not what we wanted. But, we live to … advocate for another day,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis.
“This is the spot we landed on to preserve something,” Rep. Mike Karickhoff, R-Kokomo, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle after the 90-0 vote. He authored the legislation.

The 13th check would range from $143 to $428, based on years of service for former teachers; excise, conservation and gaming officers; and most other retirees. That’s instead of the typical $150 to $450 range. Former Indiana State Police employees would get checks for 0.95% — instead of 1% — of their maximum annual pension amounts.
The bonuses would cost about $31.8 million, with the 5% cut saving about $1.7 million. That’s according to an earlier fiscal analysis, which estimated the full-amount bonuses would’ve totaled $33.5 million in the 2026 fiscal year.
Others were dissatisfied, arguing that a dismal revenue forecast shouldn’t affect the checks. They’re paid out of supplemental reserve accounts — featuring money from retirees themselves and employer matches — not the General Fund.
Pierce accused the Senate of “insisting” on the cut to “send a message” of fiscal responsibility. He called it a “kick in the teeth.”
In the Senate, however, the 39-11 vote featured opposition exclusively from worried Republicans.
“The math is not math-ing,” said Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis.
Under one of the final bills approved this session, a whopping $870 million in federal incentives could be on the way to help Indiana connect its last 150,000 Hoosiers to high-speed internet. That’s if the state’s own service providers don’t get in the way, though.
‘Number-one obstructionist’: Electricity co-ops lambasted for slow broadband rollout

Lawmakers’ attempt to mediate utility pole attachment disputes between electric utilities and telecommunications companies crossed the legislative finish line Thursday night, after languishing on the Senate’s calendar for four days.
“Obviously, I passed on this bill a lot of times,” Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, told his colleagues. “I had a lot of consternation whether … it was time for this.”
Senate Enrolled Act 502 would give both sides a 60-day deadline to meet after a government broadband grant contract is executed. They’d have four months to reach a project management agreement after the National Telecommunications Information Administration approves the Indiana Broadband Office’s proposal for spending the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) money.
It also sets detailed deadlines for cooperation if they can’t concur. And the office could set up a “rapid response mediation process” when disputes arise — pulling back from the hefty fines previously considered.
That’s the compromise lawmakers reached in the House after several rounds of edits. Zay filed a motion to concur with that chamber’s changes, but waited to call it for a vote.
“I wasn’t certain whether to bring it forward this year or wait until next year when we’re in the throes of the BEAD program,” he confessed.
Ultimately, he decided that having “this process in place will be a great start as implementation hopefully begins later this year,” adding that lawmakers could simply adjust it next year if needed.
Zay’s proposal sailed through the Senate on a concurrence for of 47-2. It heads to Braun for final approval.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Education’s attempt to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in schools by threatening to withhold federal funding from schools that refuse to comply.
U.S. District of Judge Stephanie Gallagher wrote Thursday that the court isn’t required to assess whether policies from the department “are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
But the court “is constitutionally required to closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires. The government did not,” the judge wrote.
“The Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claim, have demonstrated that they will be irreparably harmed absent preliminary relief, and have shown the equities and public interest favor them,” she wrote in a 48-page ruling.
While Gallagher focused on the process behind the policy, another federal judge blocked the attempted DEI ban based on the effects the policy would have if it was allowed to take effect.
U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty, in New Hampshire said in her 82-page ruling Thursday that a preliminary injunction was proper because the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to win on their claims that the policy is unconstitutionally vague, that it infringed on teachers’ First Amendment rights, that it would cause actual harm and that it overstepped the federal agency’s authority, among other claims.
Brown joins another lawsuit against Trump administration, taking on Education Department

And yet another judge, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich in the District of Columbia, ruled from the bench Thursday that the government could not enforce its demand that schools certify by April 24 that they were in compliance with the anti-DEI rule because the policy was so vague that schools could not know if they were in compliance or not. Threatening the loss of federal funding “without sufficiently defining the conduct that might trigger liability, violates the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on vagueness,” Friedrich said in a brief 16-page ruling.
The rulings by Friedrich and Gallagher — both of whom were appointed by President Donald Trump (R) in his first term — are effective nationwide. The preliminary injunction by McCafferty, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama (D), is nationwide as well, but only in effect at schools where plaintiffs in her case — the National Education Association, its New Hampshire chapter, and the Center for Black Educator Development — are represented.
Since being sworn in to his second term in January, Trump has pushed for the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies in federal agencies, colleges and universities and K-12 schools.
The lawsuits stem from a Feb. 14 “Dear Colleague letter” from the Education Department to schools across the country that reminded K-12 schools, colleges and universities that if they do not comply with civil rights law “face potential loss of federal funding.”
But the letter, and supporting documentation, went on to declare that DEI programs violate the law as just another form of racial discrimination, using terms like “pervasive and repugnant,” “toxic,” and “insidious” instruction that use “crude racial stereotypes” to divide students.
That was followed by an April 3 letter to state education agencies given 10 days — later extended to April 24 — to certify their compliance with federal DEI ban in order to continue receiving federal assistance.
The letter was quickly challenged. In addition to the New Hampshire plaintiffs, the NAACP filed suit in Washington, D.C., and the American Federation of Teachers, its Maryland chapter and the American Sociological Association – later joined by a school district in Eugene, Oregon — sued in Maryland.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A spokesperson for the Department of Education did not respond to emails Thursday seeking comment on the multiple court rulings. But education advocates were elated.
“Today’s decision from the court affirms what we already know – the Trump administration is unlawfully threatening educators who meet the diverse needs of every student and undermining our public education system,” AFT Maryland President Kenya Campbell said in a statement. “This preliminary injunction pauses the chaos caused by targeting and attacking vital communities and temporarily protects the critical funding schools, from our K-12 schools to our higher education institutions, rely on.”
Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement that, “Our fight is far from over, but today’s decision is a victory for Black and Brown students across the country, whose right to an equal education has been directly threatened by this Administration’s corrosive actions and misinterpretations of civil rights law.”
“We look forward to prevailing against their cruel attempts to undermine the mission of the U.S. Department of Education and relegate children of color, students with disabilities, and poor students to a second-class education in a throwback to the era before Brown v. Board of Education,” he said of the 1954 Supreme Court ruling the ended the “separate but equal” doctrine that allowed for segregated schools.
‘Reaffirming its commitment’
While the court challenges were pending, Maryland school officials were working on their own response to the DEI certification letter that had been due to federal officials by Thursday.
According to a letter from State Superintendent Carey Wright, the state will continue to affirm its commitment to upholding civil rights laws. In doing that, all 24 school system superintendents signed a certification of compliance letter that was sent via email to the federal department’s Office of Civil Rights.

Wright also mentions the New Hampshire case, in which the plaintiffs had reached a short-term agreement with the department to delay implementation of the certification, which was extended Thursday by McCafferty’s ruling.
“While MSDE [Maryland State Department of Education] is unaware of any legal authority obligating it to comply with USDE’s request, MSDE is reaffirming its commitment to complying with Title VI and other relevant federal laws,” Wright wrote.
Wright and state Board of Education President Joshua Michael issued a joint statement in a video for stakeholders.
“Above all, our charge remains to ensure that all students have equal access to a high-quality education — all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, neighborhood, disability, socioeconomic status, or the language spoken at home, Michael said. “Not only is this our moral calling, but Maryland law gives us this charge.”
As for the case in Maryland, Gallagher did reject the plaintiffs’ request to require that the Trump administration restore DEI and civil rights guidance from previous administrations on its website. She also ruled the current department can maintain an online portal titled “End DEI,” through which community members can report instances of discrimination.
“The government is entitled to express its viewpoint on its website and to maintain a reporting portal for Title VI and Equal Protection concerns, so long as it does not actually pursue enforcement actions that are not in accordance with existing law,” the judge wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pb250082_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 00:02:35.029750

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Dissatisfaction with the “status quo” is driving Jon Hansen and Karla Lems to run for South Dakota governor and lieutenant governor, they said.
The pair officially announced their 2026 campaign to hundreds of supporters Thursday at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls. The crowd included property rights advocates against eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines, “election integrity” activists and over a dozen Republican lawmakers.
Hansen, who currently serves as state House speaker, will seek the Republican Party’s nomination for governor, with Lems, his second in command in the House, running to serve as his lieutenant governor.
The two, along with speakers who introduced them, said elected officials too often put the “people’s interests” second to special interests. To resounding applause, they said that’s caused a wave of opposition to establishment politicians, a referred state pipeline law that voters rejected in November, and ousted incumbent state lawmakers in last June’s primary election.
“Grassroots patriots from all across the great state of South Dakota are standing up and we are saying in record numbers, ‘No more corruption, no more waste and abuse, no more tax on our land and our liberties and our way of life,’” Hansen said to the crowd. “Today renews the coming of the end for all of that.”

If elected, Hansen pledged to “clean up” the system by cutting state government and spending. He also promised to create “education choice grants” for alternative and private school education, and sign an executive order to “define man and woman, end the woke and restore common sense.” Hansen said he plans to stop offering “corporate welfare” as well.
Republican governors and lawmakers for decades have invested millions of tax dollars in bonds, loans and grants to entice businesses to build and expand in the state. That includes funding for farmers and value-added operations, as well as support for larger investments such as Tru Shrimp.
Hansen cited the Tru Shrimp deal as an example of “corporate welfare.”
State and local officials committed $6.5 million in taxpayer money for a low-interest loan six years ago for Tru Shrimp to build a facility in Madison. The company has not built the facility, even though it was expected to break ground in 2024. The company, which has since changed its name to Iterro, announced it’s “more than halfway” to its fundraising goal to begin the Madison project earlier this year.
“I think it’s just unnecessary government mingling, and it’s risky business, and they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars to do it,” Hansen said of the deal. “It’s that sort of stuff that we want to say ‘no more’ to. Let’s just get back to the free market, low tax and low regulation.”
A Dell Rapids lawyer, Hansen has spent a decade in the South Dakota House of Representatives. The 39-year-old was elected House speaker for the most recent legislative session after serving as speaker pro tempore from 2021 to 2022.
Lems, from Canton, owns a coffee shop and property management business. The 56-year-old entered the state political fray in 2022 and was elected as House speaker pro tempore during the most recent legislative session, the first woman to hold the position in state history.
The two are riding the momentum of private property rights and anti-abortion successes in the last year.

Both have been leading forces on property rights in the Legislature, culminating in an eminent domain ban for carbon capture pipelines signed into law this year. The legislation contributed to the Public Utilities Commission’s recent denial of Summit Carbon Solutions’ second permit application to build a portion of its $9 billion pipeline through the state.
Hansen would sometimes be introduced as “our governor” during rallies in opposition to Summit’s pipeline. He told attendees at the event Thursday that under his leadership, the “only thing that’s going to get sequestered are leftist climate policies” — a reference to Summit’s planned underground “sequestration” of carbon dioxide in North Dakota. Meanwhile, Republican President Donald Trump championed carbon capture and storage this week, highlighting it as part of his agenda to improve American energy production.
When asked about Trump’s support of carbon sequestration, Hansen said “when it comes to taking people’s land and using it without their consent in order to build a risky pipeline across their property, that’s a big no.”

Hansen has also focused on anti-abortion legislation and tightening South Dakota’s election laws in the Legislature. Now vice president of South Dakota Right to Life and co-chair of the Life Defense Fund, he organized a campaign last year that fended off a ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Hansen and Lems are the first to announce their candidacy for the governor’s race, though other prominent South Dakota politicians have said they’re considering their own bids, including Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden and Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson. Other Republicans frequently mentioned as possible candidates include Attorney General Marty Jackley, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, who briefly considered a run against Johnson for U.S. House last year.
Rhoden, who formerly served as lieutenant governor, changed the name of his campaign fundraising committee to “Rhoden for Governor” in February. His lieutenant governor, Tony Venhuizen, created a new campaign fundraising committee the same month.
The Legislature changed the process for choosing lieutenant governor nominees this year. The new law allows candidates for governor to choose their running mate, rather than relying on political party conventions to nominate them.
If more than one person from each party seeks the nomination, party voters will choose their nominee for governor in the primary election on June 2, 2026. The winners will advance to the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.
Rhoden is currently serving the remainder of the second term won by former Gov. Kristi Noem, who would’ve been term-limited at the end of 2026. She resigned earlier this year to accept the top job at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

In a statement, the U.S. Army said that Col. Sheyla Baez Ramirez had been suspended as garrison commander at Fort McCoy. 
The statement said that the suspension “is not related to any misconduct,” though the base drew recent criticism for not displaying pictures of Trump and Hegseth, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. On X, formerly known as Twitter, the Department of Defense posted a picture showing Trump’s portrait missing from  a leadership wall and Hegseth’s turned so only the back of the picture was visible. The post declared: “Regarding the Ft. McCoy Chain of Command wall controversy…. WE FIXED IT! Also, an investigation has begun to figure out exactly what happened.”
Spokespeople from the Department of Defense and Fort McCoy’s 88th Readiness Division declined to comment, but told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Ramirez has “not been relieved of command.” A subsequent statement on the U.S. Army’s website said that neither Ramirez nor anyone else on the fort’s leadership team had directed the removal of the portraits. After Ramirez was suspended, Hegseth shared a post on X mentioning the commander’s suspension.

It appears to be a case of differing interpretations of state law regarding the hiring process, and clearly represents a new interpretation of the law from the governor’s office.
Allen Simpson of Lincoln, a long-time PERB member who had headed the board’s personnel committee, told the Examiner that the committee recently recommended the hiring of the current interim director/deputy director of the agency, Tyler Cummings. He would have filled the vacancy left when the past director, former State Treasurer and State Sen. John Murante, resigned in December.
Same process followed
Simpson said the PERB search committee followed the same process as it had in hiring the previous three directors — do a search, and then let the governor approve it.
“They’re not going to get a better candidate than Tyler Cummings,” Simpson added.
He said he resigned from the board on Monday feeling that if the governor did not agree with his committee’s pick, “you probably shouldn’t stay on.”
“I’m trying to say this in the most politically correct way possible,” said Simpson, who, like Pillen, is a Republican.
However, later Thursday, Pillen’s spokeswoman, Laura Strimple, emailed that the governor hadn’t rejected anyone.
Former Nebraska lawmaker expresses concern about major changes to school retirement plan 

Strimple said that state law requires PERB to “work with the Governor” in selecting a director and that the Governor shall approve the applicant before the appointment proceeds to the Legislature.
The state law cited by Strimple clearly states that it is the responsibility of the PERB Board “to appoint a director to administer the systems under the direction of the board. The appointment shall be subject to the approval of the Governor and a majority of the Legislature.”
An Examiner reporter could not find a clause in the chapter of state law, 84-1503, cited that mentions “working with” the governor to select a director. And Strimple was not immediately available Thursday evening to clarify.
Surfaced in legislative debate 
In her earlier statement, Strimple said that “Gov. Pillen looks forward to working with the Board to identify a highly experienced leader for NPERS.”
She said that applications for the job, which had paid $205,000-a-year, are now due by May 22.
When asked about the differing interpretations of law, Simpson said that while he’s not an attorney, “I can read a statute as well as anyone else.” The personnel committee, he said, used the same process as it had in three previous selection processes, and the governor had approved all three.
Simpson added that he hoped that Cummings would still be considered to become director because he is highly qualified and has the respect of the retirement system staff.
The issue of the reopened search for a PERB director was raised during debate in the State Legislature over a bill making major changes to the state teachers retirement plan.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill that would mandate the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to screen state wards for Social Security benefit eligibility advanced Thursday to the second round of debate in the Legislature. 
Legislative Bill 275, which State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha named her priority legislation, moved forward on a 34-0 vote.
DHHS currently intercepts the Social Security benefits belonging to children in foster care and uses those funds to offset the costs of the youths’ care, according to Hunt’s statement of intent. Her bill would “bring Nebraska in line with federal law to provide further accountability, transparency, and conservation of a portion of the funds in a trust account for the youth’s own use when they exit state care.”
There was little to no debate surrounding the bill Thursday, except for some questioning of its financial impact on the state’s general funds by two Republican lawmakers. 
Hunt insisted that her amended bill would impact the state budget less than her original proposal, but that it would still give kids in foster care access to more of their Social Security money than they have today.

With the override vote on House Bill 69, lawmakers were given a chance to rise above political posturing and provide the first real increase to the base student allocation, or BSA, in nearly a decade. They failed. Seven no votes. That’s all it took to deny our public schools the $1,000 per-student increase so many have been fighting for, not for political gain, but for survival. Our students, educators and families are not abstract line items in a budget. We are not “special interests.” We are the very people who hold up the future of this state. And yet, 27 elected officials chose to turn their backs on us. Their “No” votes were loud and clear: They do not believe our children, especially those in underfunded, rural, and urban schools deserve a fully resourced, safe, and equitable education. They chose the governor’s austerity politics over our students’ needs. They chose silence in classrooms over music. Larger class sizes over individualized attention. Closures over community.
Let’s be honest: This was never just about numbers. This was about priorities. Those who voted against the override would like us to believe Alaska can’t afford to fund its public education system. But for the last seven years, they found money for everything but schools for tax credits, bloated bureaucracies, private interests and the Permanent Fund Dividend, which somehow remains sacred while our kids go without updated textbooks, working heat or school counselors. Meanwhile, school districts across the state now brace for catastrophic consequences. Layoffs. School closures. Slashed programs. And most devastatingly, students losing opportunities they may never get back. As a mother of five, a teacher, and the Alaska education chair for the NAACP Tri State Area Conference, I am furious. But I am not surprised. We’ve seen this coming. We’ve been warning them. We’ve testified, rallied and begged. This veto was a betrayal. The failure to override it was a choice. Let me be clear: This is not over.
And to be clear this doesn’t just impact students and teachers. It affects all of us. When schools suffer, communities suffer. When education is unstable, workforce readiness declines, mental health needs go unmet, and family stress skyrockets. Local businesses lose future workers. Property values drop. Crime and disengagement increase. These outcomes do not stay confined to the walls of a school they ripple through every neighborhood, every economy, every generation. Well-funded public education is a public good. It is the bedrock of a strong democracy, a healthy economy, and a just society. Undermining it undermines us all. To those who stood with us the 33 House and Senate members who voted to override we see you. We thank you. And to the others: we’ll be seeing you, too. Because this is not just about a failed vote. It’s about a fight for the soul of public education in Alaska and we are not backing down.

[…[...]","The Missoula County Court House pictured on December 20, 2020.Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks peppered questions at a lawyer for the State of Montana in a hearing Thursday about whether a bill that bans gender-affirming care for minors is constitutional.
In 2023, the Montana Legislature adopted, and Gov. Greg Gianforte signed, Senate Bill 99, which banned gender-affirming care for minors in Montana. The bill also opened up providers to punishment and civil actions.
A coalition of minors and providers sued the state, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court found the District Court in Missoula was correct in temporarily blocking the law based on privacy rights in the state Constitution.
Thursday, Marks heard arguments for summary judgment, or a decision without a trial based on the facts already presented.
ACLU of Montana lawyer Alex Rate argued the case, Cross et al v. State of Montana, is parallel to abortion lawsuits in which courts have granted summary judgment based on the state’s constitutional right to privacy.
Those abortion cases have been unanimously upheld by the Montana Supreme Court.
In a separate case regarding an executive order, Rate said, “the federal court there said, quote, the evidence supporting gender affirming care for adolescents is as robust as the evidence supporting other pediatric treatments.”
However, Michael Noonan and Thane Johnson for the State of Montana said a trial is warranted.
Noonan said the parties disagree on many material facts, such as the harms of gender-affirming care, and experts are offering differing opinions that need to be sorted out.
“A trial is the appropriate time to evaluate the merits of the competing evidence presented in this case,” Noonan said.
State argues it’s protecting minors
In his argument, Noonan said the state Constitution gives the state the power to protect minors in Article 2 Section 15, and SB 99 “clearly enhances the protection of minors.”
He said care can leave people infertile or irreversibly physically damaged, it isn’t proven to reduce the risk of suicide, and some countries in Europe, which had been the “vanguard” of such treatments, have since reversed course.
Meanwhile, Noonan said, some people in the U.S. end up rushed into gender-affirming care, without an adequate or even any psychological evaluation.
When the government has a “compelling interest,” such as protecting a minor, it can enforce a law designed to be narrow enough to address that interest.
In one of many questions for Noonan, Marks said he wanted to know why the law bans the treatment altogether.
Instead, Marks said, it could have required extra evaluations before allowing a patient to grant “informed consent,” a voluntary decision to receive a medical intervention with knowledge of its risks and benefits.
“I don’t see this as narrowly tailored to the problem you’re addressing. Can you help me with that?” Marks said.
Marks also said the idea that people under 18 can’t give informed consent doesn’t seem to be supported by Montana law.
Noonan said Montana’s approach in SB 99 aligns with Europe’s approach, which starts with psychotherapy, but doesn’t rush into gender-affirming care.
He said in the U.S. minors are being hurried into treatments that might be unnecessary, and they don’t get the “full scope” of what might alleviate their gender dysphoria, the condition of feeling like one’s gender is out of alignment with one’s sex at birth.
But Marks said under the law, even minors who had gone through an extensive evaluation and continued to experience gender dysphoria would not be able to receive gender-affirming care.
“Doesn’t that seem problematic?” Marks said.
The judge also said Montana offers a higher degree of privacy protection than other states.
Additionally, Marks said he struggled with the idea that the legislature could ban a certain treatment because the possibility of a negative outcome, a conclusion he saw in the state’s argument.
For example: What about a concern stemming from a debunked claim that measles vaccines cause problems?
Noonan argued the parallel didn’t apply: “There was one study that’s been clearly debunked, and the medical consensus, at least I would say globally, is that vaccines are fine. We don’t have the same facts here.”
Marks, though, said he wrestled with the idea the state had a legitimate position in its blanket ban on gender-affirming care when minors already can give consent to treatments that can result in other serious harms or even death, such as surgery to remove a brain tumor.
“Under Montana law, this is literally the only treatment that a child cannot give informed consent to,” Marks said. “ … Why do you think that’s a defensible position?”
Noonan said adolescents don’t always choose wisely, it’s not a lifelong ban, and the decisions are heavy and consequential, such as infertility.
“Can they even weigh what that means in the future, and will that matter to them?” Noonan said.
Plaintiffs show framework for summary judgment
Rate said the state offered claims about gender-affirming care from “experts who don’t treat gender dysphoria” and witnesses who don’t have any connection to Montana.
He said it had to look to Europe for its arguments, although no country offers a ban as “draconian” as Montana’s, and the two that the state identified are in the United Kingdom, which he said allows hormones at 16.
He said the “true justification for Senate Bill 99” is “animus, plain and simple.”
Rate, for the ACLU of Montana, said the case is actually simple and straightforward.
Rate said the cases that offer the legal framework are abortion cases in Montana, which have been decided on summary judgment without trial “almost without exception.”
The plaintiffs are Phoebe Cross, a transgender minor, and parents Molly and Paul Cross; a couple of medical providers Juanita Hodax and Katherine Mistretta, on behalf of themselves and their patients; and a John Doe and Jane Doe.
Their legal team also includes ACLU’s National LGBT & HIV Project, Lambda Legal, and Perkins Coie.
As for the legal framework, Rate said the right to privacy for abortion is parallel in this case for gender-affirming care, and privacy is protected in the Montana Constitution.
“Health care decisions should be made between an individual and their health care providers, not by the legislature, not by the executive, not by the courts,” Rate said.
He said the state had argued that abortion comes with great risk of complications, and the state had a right to protect its citizens.
But Rate said in Weems et al. vs. State of Montana and other cases, the court found the state could not show the laws were narrowly tailored to address the concern.
He also pointed to rulings in Planned Parenthood vs. the state of Montana and Armstrong vs. the State of Montana.
Additionally, he said, the state’s argument about a high health risk didn’t hold up when compared to abortion.
In another parallel case, he said the court found a medical protocol — endorsed by major medical organizations — was prohibited for abortion care, but the identical protocol was allowed for miscarriages.
But in that case, the court found there can’t be “a bona fide health risk” if the protocols are the same, he said. Rather, Rate said, “the state made a values judgment that it doesn’t like abortion.”
In fact, he said, in another case about parental consent, the state argued a minor was not mature enough to decide to get an abortion, but the court struck down that law as well, finding the state’s interest wasn’t compelling, or narrowly tailored.
The state argued some people regret gender-affirming care, and Rate said some people periodically regret abortion too, but that doesn’t justify making it illegal.
Even if the judge accepted the state’s “overly inflated” data point that 30% of people who experience such care regret it — “which we vigorously dispute” — he said it would still mean 70% don’t regret it, but would be banned from receiving it.
Even in the Cross case, he said, the court has provided a clear roadmap to strike down SB 99 as unconstitutional.
Rate also shared the results of gender-affirming care for one of the team’s clients.
“Our client Phoebe Cross has flourished as a result of receiving gender affirming care,” Rate said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201220_mslabuildings_tm_024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 23:01:45.583261

The latest bill would also nix a proposed carveout for some single-family homes and shorten the time that new construction would be exempt from the cap.
The news provides a potential middle-ground resolution for a bill that is a top priority for progressives and a policy idea that failed to win approval in Olympia last year. 
Rep. Nicole Macri, D-Seattle, said Thursday that “I know that there will be many tenants around the state who will have wished for a stronger policy, but this bill brings important protections.”
Lawmakers once appeared set to push through a 7% cap despite staunch opposition from Republicans, some moderate Democrats and many landlords. 
But the Senate thwarted that plan this month when lawmakers raised the limit to 10% plus inflation in a surprising move that squeaked through by a single vote. The Democratic senator who proposed the change said at the time that a 7% cap “is dangerous.”
Republicans and a smattering of Democrats also moved successfully in the Senate to exempt single-family home rentals not owned by a real estate development trust or company, carving out a sizable chunk of landlords from the potential cap.
Advocates argued the Senate’s changes “gutted” the legislation.
The compromise measure removes the single-family home exemption.
Through the process, lawmakers had also moved to exempt new buildings from the cap for their first 15 years. Negotiators dropped that period down to 12 years in the new plan.
The legislation would still expire after 15 years, as the Senate had proposed.
The House and Senate could vote on the new version of House Bill 1217 as soon as Friday evening. The legislative session is slated to end Sunday.
If both chambers pass the bill and the governor signs it, the policy would go into effect immediately.
Democrats last year pushed for such a cap on rent increases, only to have moderate members of their own party and Republicans block progress. They believe a known limit on increases would provide stability to renters who could be forced out of their homes by steep rent hikes.
“I think this is life-changing legislation for a lot of families across Washington state,” said House Housing Committee Chair Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds.
Republicans have argued the cap would force builders out of the state and put landlords in a bind as they struggle to keep up with inflationary maintenance costs and property taxes.
On Thursday, conservative lawmakers expressed frustration about being shut out of the negotiating process, and continued to decry the proposal.
“I do believe that the policy that’s before me tonight is going to be devastating for our housing providers, and we need housing providers to be a part of the solution in the housing crisis that we have,” said Rep. Sam Low, R-Lake Stevens.
Through all the debates on what is, perhaps, the most contentious policy bill of the legislative session, Gov. Bob Ferguson has remained mum on his feelings about it.
The negotiated bill otherwise contains many of the provisions included in earlier iterations.
For example, landlords also could not raise rent by any amount in the first 12 months of a tenancy. If landlords violate the new law, tenants or the state attorney general’s office could bring litigation.
Buildings owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities would be exempt from the limits. The same goes for duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes if the owner lives in one of the units.
The legislation also looks to cap rent increases at 5% per year for manufactured home tenants.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 23:01:45.583261

(Photo by Lisa Phu/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections has reported three in-custody deaths in the month of April so far, bringing the total reported this year to five in-custody deaths. 
Nathaniel David Leask, 49, died on April 3 in the Anchorage Correctional Complex. He was remanded just six days prior, for “multiple probation violations” according to the department.
The ACLU of Alaska first reported that Leask died by suicide, and said according to witnesses that he lay for more than three hours before correctional staff began attempting life-saving measures. It was the second in-custody suicide this year. The civil rights group has called for more resources for mental health care, and greater oversight and accountability from the Department of Corrections in protocols surrounding in-custody deaths, and preventing more deaths. 
The Alaska Department of Public Safety confirmed Leask’s death was a suicide on Thursday, through department spokesperson Austin McDaniel. 
“Troopers were notified at 8:40 pm on April 3 that 49-year-old Ketchikan resident Nathaniel Leask had died at Anchorage Correctional Center inside of a general housing cell. An investigation conducted by the Alaska State Troopers determined that Leask’s injuries were self-inflicted. Next of kin have been notified, and his body was sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office,” he said in an email statement. 
Alaska state troopers conduct investigations into all in-custody deaths, “just as we would for any other unanticipated death that occurs in Alaska,” McDaniel said. “Our primary duty is to determine if any criminal conduct contributed to the decedent’s death.”
Also in April, two people died in-custody that McDaniel said were “medically expected deaths.”
Marcias Zorita Reinhold, 83, died in Hiland Mountain Correctional Center in Eagle River on April 8. She had been incarcerated since 1998, according to the department.
Lena Lola Lynn, 63, died in Goose Creek Correctional Center in Wasilla on Sunday, April 20. She was remanded on June 21, 2024, for “parole violations related to prior convictions,” the department said.
DOC has reported five in-custody deaths so far this year. 
Pedro George Rubke, 78, died on Feb. 4, in Goose Creek Correctional Center. He had been incarcerated since 2012. 
Reginald Eugene Childers Jr., 42, died on March 3 at the Anchorage Correctional Complex. He was remanded on January 3, and was incarcerated pretrial. According to the State Troopers, he was found unresponsive in a cell and transported to a hospital where he later died. The death was deemed a suicide. 
The recent deaths bring the tally to at least 70 deaths in custody of DOC jails and prisons since 2020, with at least 18 deaths reported as suicides, according to the department. 
DOC declined to comment on the recent death incidents on Thursday. Betsy Holley, a department spokesperson, said internal investigations are ongoing.
“​​Our processes remain consistent: every inmate death is treated with the utmost seriousness,” she said by email. “Each case undergoes a thorough internal review by both our Medical and Institutions Divisions, as well as an external and independent review by the Department of Public Safety and the State Medical Examiner. Of the three deaths referenced, two were anticipated by medical personnel—specific details of which we are legally prohibited from sharing due to HIPAA regulations.”
There have been three wrongful death lawsuits filed against DOC since 2022. In March, the family of Lewis Jordan Jr. and the ACLU of Alaska filed a lawsuit for the 53-year-old’s death in Goose Creek Correctional Center in 2023 alleging staff displayed “deliberate indifference” and ignored his pleas for medical attention for an ear infection. His condition deteriorated into fatal meningitis, and he later died after weeks in a coma and his family had to remove him from life support.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Democrats, progressive groups and constituents in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District are keeping up the pressure on Republican U.S. Rep Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton as the GOP’s narrow House majority closes in on drastic federal budget cuts that could have a big impact in the battleground district.
More than 100 people gathered Thursday in a high school auditorium in Thornton for the latest in a series of “People’s Town Halls” organized by the Democratic National Committee across the country, in districts where Republican members of Congress have declined to hold in-person town halls themselves. In place of Evans, attendees asked questions of Rep. Greg Casar, a Democrat in his second term representing Texas’ 35th District.
“My title actually isn’t congressman. The title is representative,” Casar told the crowd. “And the person that is supposed to be representing you here in Colorado is not acting like a representative. He’s acting like an employee of the Trump-Musk organization, and he’s not going to show up and answer your questions.”

Casar and Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib shared the stage with a cardboard cutout of Evans — complete with chicken legs for a lawmaker who Rebecca Miller, a hospice nurse criticizing Evans’ support for Medicaid cuts, said was too “chicken” to hold a proper town hall.
“I’m sure you recognize my voice, since I call you at least once a week,” Miller told the cutout. “Hey Gabe, did you know that 25% of your constituents … are on Medicaid? That’s 73,000 people that you’re getting ready to kick off their health care.”
Evans and his fellow Republicans in Congress are pursuing a major rewrite of the federal budget, and have approved an initial plan calling for trillions of dollars in tax cuts paired with trillions more in cuts to spending programs, including $880 billion in cuts to be made by the committee that oversees Medicaid. That legislative effort has coincided with an unprecedented executive power grab by President Donald Trump’s administration, which has attempted to shut down congressionally-authorized agencies and departments, freeze spending programs, order mass layoffs of federal workers, and take other actions that run contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution.
After multiple House Republicans faced backlash from constituents over the GOP agenda during town halls earlier this year, party leaders advised their members to stop holding in-person events, Politico reported.
Evans, serving his first two-year term after defeating former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by about 2,500 votes in the 2024 election, appears to have listened. To date, he has held just a single telephone town hall, answering a select handful of questions on a call that many constituents reported was plagued by technical issues.

“They were told by House Speaker Mike Johnson not to have town halls, so they’re just doing what they’re told,” Casar said.
Though he represents one of the country’s most evenly divided congressional districts, Evans — a former Arvada police officer and Army veteran who served one term in the state Legislature before running for Congress — has done little to distance himself from Trump and his agenda. He has endorsed Trump’s plans to carry out the mass deportations of more than 12 million immigrants in the country without authorization and backed the president’s chaotic efforts to launch a global trade war.
In a statement, Delanie Bomar, an Evans spokesperson, called Casar a far-left activist “who wants to see socialism and transgenderism take over America.”
“He represents the total opposite of Congressman Gabe Evans’ commonsense and winning plan of improving public safety, the immigration system, and the economy,” Bomar said. “Any day with Greg Casar in Colorado’s 8th District is a day that helps re-elect Gabe Evans in 2026.”
With Evans absent, critics of the Republican agenda have sought to fill the vacuum with events of their own, including a March 22 event in Northglenn organized by local groups. Last month, more than 10,000 people turned out for a rally in Greeley to hear from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who taunted Evans from the stage for refusing to meet with his constituents.
Thursday’s town hall was jointly organized by the DNC and the Colorado Democratic Party. Two other events are planned for this weekend: a Medicaid-focused event organized by labor groups, scheduled for Friday evening at the Thornton Community Center; and a town hall at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the Moxie Theater in Greeley.
Medicaid cuts
The 8th District is Colorado’s most diverse — about 40% of its residents are Latino — and most competitive House seat. Drawn by an independent redistricting commission after the 2020 census awarded Colorado an additional congressional seat, it extends from Denver’s northern suburbs to Greeley and more rural areas in southern Weld County.
With Republicans holding just a three-vote majority in the House, the 8th District race could again prove crucial in determining control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. Caraveo earlier this month announced she would seek to win her old seat back next year, but first she faces a primary contest against Democratic state Rep. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City.
Murib said that despite Democrats’ relatively strong performance in Colorado in 2024, the loss of the 8th District race was a disappointment the party is eager to make up for next year.
“We are not going to let Gabe Evans continue to be employee of the month for Donald Trump,” Murib said. “We are not going to continue to let this cardboard cutout stay away from the people.”
Polls show that cuts to Medicaid, which provides health care to more than 1 in 5 Americans, are deeply unpopular, with 82% of Americans believing that funding for the program should be increased or kept the same, according to a March KFF survey.
Evans has defended House Republicans’ budget resolution, which mandates the $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees Medicaid spending, by falsely claiming that there are “a wide range of places where those cost savings can be found.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicaid comprises 93% of the spending that could be cut by the committee. As a result, the GOP’s budget requires a minimum of $700 billion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years — or a 10% reduction in projected spending.
Evans sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will be responsible for implementing the Medicaid cuts required by the budget plan. Casar noted that with Republicans holding only a razor-thin majority, it would only require a handful of GOP House members to “replace the chicken legs with normal legs” to derail the budget plan.
“Your organizing from here over the course of the next few weeks could save Medicaid as we know it,” Casar said. “That’s why I got on a plane all the way over here to do this. … I know we can and will do it.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House overwhelmingly rejected an Education Savings Account bill Thursday night, a day after the governor vetoed a similar bill.
House members voted 78-14 against Senate Bill 2400, which sought to provide private school vouchers plus Education Savings Accounts for public school and homeschooled students.
In vetoing House Bill 1540, which only benefited private school students, Gov. Kelly Armstrong urged lawmakers to move the competing proposal forward.
Armstrong vetoes North Dakota private school voucher bill, but signals support for competing bill

But the $110 million price tag to the Senate bill is likely why many opposed it, said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson.
Lefor, who supported the bill, said he doesn’t see a path for an Education Savings Account proposal to come back this session.
“I’m a strong advocate for school choice, and I will continue to be,” Lefor said.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, included vouchers for private school students ranging from $1,000 to $3,500 per student, depending on household income. The dollars could be spent on tuition or other qualifying educational expenses.
Public school and homeschooled students would be eligible for $1,000 for educational expenses. Private school students attending schools that don’t participate in the program would be eligible for $500.
The House Education Committee voted 11-3 to give the bill a do-not-pass recommendation. Rep. Dori Hauck, R-Hebron, a member of the committee, said members were concerned about the complexity of the bill and the administrative burden to oversee it.
“Questions remain about how easily DPI (Department of Public Instruction) could implement, manage and expand the system without significant additional staffing and resources,” Hauck said.
Supporters have advocated for expanding educational opportunities for students and giving parents more power over their children’s education. Opponents objected to spending public dollars to pay for private school tuition. Axtman’s bill included $3 million in the event it passed and was challenged by a lawsuit.
Armstrong advocated for a school choice bill that benefited all students, not only those who attend private school. Others questioned spending additional money on public school students when the state already invests in K-12 education.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, the chief sponsor of the bill vetoed by Armstrong, said he believes it will be difficult to get enough support to overturn the governor’s veto.
Koppelman said he plans to introduce a bill during the 2027 legislative session that is “a bit more wide sweeping.” 
“We’ll come back next session,” he said. 
Lawmakers began the legislative session with five Education Savings Account bills, but none of the proposals remain under consideration. 
Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown, said he voted against bills with public dollars for private school tuition because he represents a rural area that doesn’t have private schools.
“I guess this session just wasn’t the right time,” Vigesaa said.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Legislature’s Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) deadlocked Thursday on whether to object to a proposed administrative rule that would guide the conduct of election observers at polling places. 
The 5-5 vote moves the rule one step closer to going into effect because if the committee doesn’t take any action, it will be returned to the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) to be implemented. 
Even though the rule was written by WEC with input from an advisory committee that included members of right-wing election conspiracy groups, election skeptics opposed the rule’s passage at a number of public hearings. 
At a hearing on Monday, 2020 election deniers — including former state Rep. Janel Brandtjen — testified in opposition to the rule because they believed it didn’t do enough to protect the rights of election observers. Lawmakers on the committee, including its co-chair, Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), complained that the rule was written without enough input from legislators. 
Despite that opposition, Rep. Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca) joined with the committee’s four Democrats, Sens. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) and Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Reps. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) and Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) to vote against the motion objecting to the rule’s passage. 
In Monday’s hearing, election commissioner Don Millis said the rule gives the state the best chance to clarify how election observers should conduct themselves while protecting the rights of voters. 
“I don’t agree with everything in the rule, but I don’t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good,” he said. “Without this rule, municipal clerks have wide ranging authorities to manage polling places as they see fit. There’s no reasonable argument that observers are better off without this rule.”
While Thursday’s vote is a step toward implementation, the rule is still in the committee until May 11, according to the office of the committee’s other co-chair, Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater). The committee could vote on the issue again before then.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers questioned the qualifications of the mental health department’s chief financial officer after he was unable to provide basic information about the agency’s budget shortfall and why it cannot pay its bills. 
Lawmakers spent three hours peppering Skip Leonard with questions about the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ $43 million deficit, what steps they’ve taken to fill the gap, and how a $6.2 million supplemental request would be enough to carry the agency through the end of the fiscal year. 
Leonard, the agency’s interim chief financial officer tasked with managing the agency’s over $610 million budget, was unable to give specific examples to many questions, but promised a renewed budget request of the Legislature by next week. 
Leonard’s testimony, which was made under oath, filled the second day of a special House committee hearing investigating the agency’s finances. Lawmakers are probing reports of financial disarray at the agency as well as why some provider contracts were abruptly cut or canceled. Allie Friesen, the mental health commissioner, who testified last week has pointed fingers at previous administrations for financial problems and a failure to make proper budget requests.

During her testimony, Friesen told lawmakers to ask Leonard for specifics about the agency’s financial shortfalls.
Frustration visibly built among lawmakers throughout the meeting as Leonard and the agency’s general counsel, Christina Green, were unable to explain the numbers being presented.  
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow, asked Leonard about his qualifications to be the chief financial officer of a state agency. 
Leonard said he was formerly a city manager who has dealt with large budgets, but is not a certified public accountant and has no experience leading finances for a state agency. 
“I’m guessing I’m not the only one in here at this point that’s mildly confused at the CFO of the agency not being able to be the one that can do a deep dive into issues,” Marti said. “I’m appreciating what you’re bringing to the table … but if the chief financial officer of the (agency) is more of a visionary on community outreach and not diving deep into these issues, I find that concerning.” 
Leonard said he was not initially hired to be a CFO. Leonard’s LinkedIn profile lists his initial role with the agency as “executive partnership consultant,” which he began in November. He said he received “no formal training” from the agency when he became interim CFO. 
He said he first became aware of the deficit around 4 p.m. Feb. 21 after an agency budget director brought it to his attention. At first, agency officials believed the deficit was $63.7 million, but after further investigation, they later lowered the shortfall to $43 million. Leonard also said the agency spent $9.5 million from its budget for the current fiscal year on last year’s debts.
Marti said Leonard’s hourly pay rate adds up to $343,000 if he were to be employed full time for a year at his current hourly rate of $165 per hour. No listing has been posted for a permanent CFO yet, as Leonard said they’re waiting until the agency “gets through” its current budget situation.
Marti said in the last year, the agency hired 20 employees with salaries $100,000 or more. He said 12 more had their salaries raised to that level, and another 13 were hired with salaries under six figures. 
Rep. Ellyn Hefner, D-Oklahoma City, also questioned Leonard’s apparent lack of understanding on specifics of the agency’s finances. 
“Respectfully, Mr. Leonard, do you recognize your lack of knowledge and skill?” she said. “Why would you stay in this position, with all these months going by, making critical decisions that have definitely hit providers in our districts?”
After the hearing, Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chaired the special committee, said he still has a lot of questions, and it’s concerning that there isn’t more clarity and certainty in the two months since the department leaders were made aware of the deficit. 
“We started all of this to have more confidence in the numbers that have been presented,” he said. “I don’t know that I have any more confidence today than the day when we started. But we’re committed to getting this information so that we can make the best decisions that we can before sine die.”
He said he’s not sure why the agency only needs a $6.2 million supplemental.

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, also said during the hearing that he doesn’t understand how the supplemental budget request could cover such a large deficit. 
“Essentially, the department had a $9.5 million structural deficit from the jump,” he said. “And you’re short and you’re only asking for $6.2 million. I would say, publicly, that’s great if all we need is $6.2 million, but Mr. Leonard, the math is just not adding up.”
Leonard, who said he assumed the interim role in January, said he “can’t answer all those questions completely,” but told lawmakers $2.9 million in contracts were cut, the agency found $8 million in “fixed utilization savings,” and another $3.5 million to $4 million in contract cuts within the department. 
Lawmakers also asked the mental health department’s general counsel, Green, questions focused on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements signed by executive staff within the agency. 
Green said state law doesn’t allow or preclude state agencies from having employees sign such agreements and said they were requested by Friesen to prevent information from being leaked from executive staff meetings on sensitive internal investigations. 
Green said she drafted an initial NDA from an existing agency draft, but later found it was too restrictive as it would allow the agency to pursue monetary damages against employees. She then created a second, briefer confidentiality agreement. 
Leonard and Green said signing the agreements was optional. Leonard and Green both signed such agreements. 
Rep. Chris Kannady, R-Oklahoma City, said there was “indication” that the agency’s director of workplace violence and behavioral threat assessment had held a meeting with those asked to sign the agreements, threatening to go “full cop mode” if they weren’t signed. 
Green and Leonard both said they were not present at the meeting, didn’t know who attended, or what was discussed. 
House officials hope to hold additional hearings next week, including one with Regina Birchum, executive director of the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency. LOFT is also investigating the mental health department’s finances in addition to the committee, the state auditor and a “special investigator.”

Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, filed the resolution Thursday, citing the limited time board members had to review the final draft of the standards and the “magnitude of the decision” they made. Pugh leads the Senate Education Committee.
The resolution states “questions exist regarding the transparency of the subject matter standard adoption process.” Pugh also noted the standards would cost $33 million to implement with new textbooks and classroom materials.
Academic standards dictate what topics public schools must teach to students. The social studies standards have attracted significant controversy over their inclusion of Bible stories and the last-minute addition of language suggesting there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results.
Pugh is the first Republican lawmaker to publicly support rejecting the proposed standards. It is also the first time any lawmakers have suggested disapproving the standards for science. 
He did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday evening.
To reject the standards would send them back to the state Board of Education for further review, which is what at least one board member, Ryan Deatherage, has said he hopes the Legislature will do. The current standards, approved in 2019, would remain in effect until a new version is approved.
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday encouraged the Legislature to take action on the standards and raised doubts about the integrity of the board’s approval process. Stitt alleged officials at the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed board members a different version of the standards from what they ultimately voted on.

State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who leads the agency and the board, said Thursday this is untrue. Records from the Education Department indicate the board members received the updated version of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before they took a vote the following morning on Feb. 27.
Making changes to the proposed draft based on public comment and input from focus groups has long been a common practice at the Education Department, Walters said.
Deatherage and two other recent appointees to the board, Chris Van Denhende and Mike Tinney, said Walters failed to notify them that changes had been made to the standards from the original draft posted for public comment in December. The board met Thursday for the first time since it approved the standards in February.
Walters said he couldn’t control whether the board members read the materials provided to them nor that the governor placed them on the board at the end of the 10-month process to develop the new standards.
“All those board members, we didn’t have their information,” Walters said after the meeting Thursday. “We’re sitting here trying to struggle to make sure they can actually legally sit for the (Feb. 27) meeting. So, that’s kind of the behind-the-scenes of what we were trying to do to get a board meeting off. So I say all that to say they knew that they’d been updated.”
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions earlier this month to similarly reject the social studies standards in full.
However, Republican leaders of the House and Senate said there hasn’t been enough consensus among the GOP supermajority to ensure a rejection of the standards would pass in either chamber.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said Thursday the “decision has not been made” on how senators will proceed in light of the governor’s comments this week.
“It is open,” Paxton said. “We are looking at it again.”
Pugh’s resolution would need to pass both the House and Senate by May 1 to reject the standards.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said a vote from his Republican caucus “doesn’t look likely.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The data center industry that powers everything online is reshaping the energy marketplace and Pennsylvania is poised to see an economic boost as companies like Amazon and Microsoft move into the state.
But regulators must strike a balance between feeding a data center’s voracious appetite for electricity and ensuring that the lights stay on and costs remain reasonable for regular people, members of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission heard Thursday.
“Pennsylvania is an attractive location for data center operators due to low cost rural land and property taxes, as well as the currently abundant supply of natural gas and excess electricity,” Allison Kaster, director of the commission’s Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement, said.
And the demand for data is constantly increasing, said Michael Fradette, an energy expert for Amazon Data Services, which last year purchased a data center campus in Luzerne County that will eventually consume about as much electricity as the city of Pittsburgh.
In addition to critical government and financial operations, video conferencing, remote learning, telehealth, artificial intelligence and online gaming all run off data centers. And those are competing with other sectors, such as transportation, heating and cooling and manufacturing, where the demand for electricity is also growing, Fradette said.
“We recognize the need for a balanced approach that supports technology, technological advancement, sustainable energy practices and fair cost allocation,” said Fradette, who was one of four data center industry experts who testified before the PUC.
On the other side of the electric meter are the electricity companies that distribute power for homes, offices and industry and the grid operator. Pennsylvania’s grid is operated by PJM Interconnection, which also serves all or part of 12 northeast and midwest states by ensuring there’s enough power generation to meet demands.
PJM estimates that its peak demand will grow nearly 17% by 2035. While it faces its own problems connecting new powerplants fast enough to satisfy that growth, the task of ensuring the electrical infrastructure is up to the challenge falls largely to electricity distribution companies such as PECO Energy, PPL Electric Utilities and FirstEnergy Pennsylvania Electric Co.
“This potential demand growth is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before,” Richard Webster, vice president for regulatory policy & strategy at Peco, said. Webster was one of four electricity company representatives who testified.
The cost of maintaining and upgrading electricity infrastructure by local electric utilities is passed along to customers according to rates that are approved by the PUC. But the demand from data centers will require electric utilities to build new substations and infrastructure.
PUC Chairman Stephen DeFrank said the commission’s goal is to develop a regulatory structure – known as a tariff – for data centers and other large-load customers that allows them to connect to the grid quickly, while ensuring that consumers aren’t left to pay the cost for projects that don’t pan out.
That’s likely to include financial security requirements to cover the cost of engineering studies and construction. The tariff may include incentives for developers who build their own infrastructure and equipment, which often requires long lead times. 
“If they build that out, and decide not to come, well that’s their dime. It’s not the rate payer’s dime, and that’s what we’re concerned about,” DeFrank told the Capital-Star.
At the same time, the commission needs to ensure that developers who want to build in Pennsylvania can do so on a schedule that makes sense for business. 
“We will never have a load-growth opportunity in our lifetime again like this,” DeFrank said. “This is the industrial revolution for the information age. This is equivalent to … the printing press.”
The PUC will accept written public comments until May 27 and replies to comments until June 11. Instructions for submitting comments are on the hearing website.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/three-mile-island-2024-1024x767.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 20:59:34.382003

Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne, listens to bills in the House Chamber on April 24, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Much of the compromise reached for House Enrolled Act 1004 mirrors what left the Senate earlier this month. Penalties for five nonprofit health systems exceeding “price caps” have now been pushed off into 2029 — after the Office of Management and Budget identifies the “average hospital rate” for certain inpatient and outpatient services. 
The final version retained a provision to strip nonprofit hospitals of their tax-exempt status under Indiana code as well as enhanced reporting metrics. 
“Even with those changes, we are making meaningful, incremental changes to provide relief to our constituents,” said author Rep. Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne. 
Most House Democrats opposed the bill, citing concerns about what losing a nonprofit status could mean for a community. 
“(The) loss of nonprofit state versus a penalty will impact what benefits are provided to the community to keep Hoosiers healthier and prevent the unnecessary use of hospital services,” said Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis. 
A provision allowing the state to phase out the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers low- and moderate-income Hoosiers, if federal funds are not allocated also gave her pause. 
“There is nothing in this bill that ensures that patients will pay less for quality health care, but there is a lot of red tape,” she continued. “And there is an increase in administration and labor fees, so we will be voting no.”
Shackleford and 22 other lawmakers — including one Republican — voted against the bill in the House. 
For the first time, the state will also institute a Managed Care Assessment Fee, similar to the provider tax known as the Hospital Assessment Fee, which could reap a maximum $1.4 billion annually — though the rate would need to be negotiated with the federal government. 
  Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks against legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Additionally, insurer negotiations with hospitals will be separated from Medicare Advantage deals — even if the insurer offers both. Combined with a reconfigured Hospital Assessment Fee that will leverage a larger federal reimbursement to health systems, Republicans said rural hospitals notched some wins. 
“Two-thirds of Indiana nonprofit hospitals benefited more from the federal, state and local tax breaks than they invested back into their communities,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. “… this bill is going to put more dollars into our rural systems all across the state.”
But reliable opposing Sens. Liz Brown and Tyler Johnson — Republicans from Fort Wayne and Leo, respectively — shared their discontent with setting pricing standards for any industry. Both have ties to Parkview Health, one of the five systems named in the bill, which recently announced a deal to purchase a struggling hospital in Cass County that would have otherwise closed.
“If they lose their not-for-profit status, they lose their license. Which means they can’t operate at all … they have to close their doors,” Brown said. 
She worried that, under such a situation, a for-profit chain would only buy certain facilities, leaving out the rural hospitals that depend on their nonprofit status.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A powerful Alaska Senate committee is considering a draft of Alaska’s state operating budget that would cut more than $200 million from a version adopted earlier this month by the state House.
The Senate Finance Committee unveiled the first draft of its operating budget proposal during a Thursday morning meeting in the Capitol at Juneau.
The biggest item on the committee’s chopping block was a significant public school funding increase. The House voted for an $81 million bump in K-12 public school funding above what lawmakers and Gov. Mike Dunleavy approved last year. 
That increase is gone in the Senate’s budget, as is almost every other budget addition proposed by the House. Dunleavy proposed budget increases as well — for state troopers, health care and additional staff in various state departments — and almost all of those were eliminated, too.
“Those were eliminated from the budget, along with the request that the governor had for all other increments, because of our financial condition,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and the member of the finance committee in charge of writing its draft budget for state services and programs.
Despite cuts, notable deficit remains
Even with the Senate’s cuts, preliminary figures show that the operating budget — when combined with other budget bills — still contains a deficit of between $70 million and $140 million.
That figure will almost certainly change, because some costs — particularly labor contracts — have not yet been determined.
“We are still in deficit mode. There is still work that needs to be done on this budget to have it balance,” Hoffman said.
The bipartisan majority in charge of the state Senate has vowed to write a balanced budget that does not require spending from savings. 
The document revealed Thursday keeps to that pledge. Unlike the House version of the budget, there’s no section unlocking the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the $2.8 billion fund that is the state’s largest savings account.
The committee’s proposal keeps a roughly $1,400 Permanent Fund dividend approved by the House; at $950 million, that is the third-largest item in the budget, behind education and health spending, respectively.
Among the committee’s few additions are additions to the state’s wildfire-response and disaster-response funds. These additions would bring the funds up to the amount needed to pay for average annual expenses over the past five years.
Cuts to child care and corrections proposals
The committee’s proposed elimination of House-adopted increases are much more significant. 
Among them: Permanently closing part of Spring Creek prison to save $7.5 million per year, eliminating double-overtime pay for some prison guards to save $6 million per year, cutting teacher recruitment programs to save $1 million per year, reversing a funding increase for Parents as Teachers and the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, eliminating grants to child advocacy centers to save $5.5 million, and eliminating more than $13 million intended to improve access to child care.
Funding increases proposed by the House for senior services were eliminated, as was money for athletics programs and research facilities at the University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Hoffman noted that no action taken by the finance committee is final. The budget bill is subject to amendments in committee, debate on the Senate floor, and then any differences between the House and Senate may be negotiated in a conference committee whose task will be to find a compromise between the two drafts.
“There’s a large difference between the House and Senate at this time. There’s a lot of work left to do at the conference table,” he said.

He was put to death Thursday April, 24 2025. (Alabama Department of Corrections)The state of Alabama executed James Osgood by lethal injection Thursday for his role in the 2010 rape and murder of Tracy Brown.
It was the second execution conducted by the state this year.
“I haven’t said her name since that day,” Osgood said before the start of the execution according to media witnesses. “I felt like it was disrespectful to say it. But then sometimes I felt like it was disrespectful not to. Today, it will be the first time I say her name. ‘Tracy, I apologize.’”
Osgood, 55, was pronounced dead at 6:35 p.m,, according to a news release from Gov. Kay Ivey, which referred to Brown by the last name of Wilemon. Court records used Brown to identify the victim.
“The murder of Tracy Wilemon was premeditated, gruesome and disturbing, and tonight, the state carried out the death sentence of James Osgood,” Ivey said in her news release. “Both Mr. Osgood and his accomplice – who will never see the light of day – from the moment they were inspired by a Hollywood torture scene, set out to commit this heinous crime against Ms. Wilemon and are now paying the price.
“I pray that her loved ones can feel some sense of closure today,” Ivey said.
Media witnesses did not observe any complications with the execution. The curtain opened at 6:05 p.m. and witnesses saw some labored breathing along with Osgood moving his fingers until he stopped moving all together at 6:18 p.m. Staff then closed the curtain at 6:25 p.m.
Osgood and his then girlfriend, Tonya Van Dyke, accompanied Brown to her home in 2010 and then proceeded to sexually assault and kill her.
Van Dyke pleaded guilty for her role in Brown’s death in exchange for the district attorney removing the death penalty from consideration. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Osgood was convicted of two counts of capital murder in 2014, the second charge due to the fact the murder was committed during a sexual assault.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the Chilton County trial court in 2016, ruling that the trial judge had made an error in the instructions to the jury during the penalty phase of the trial.
In 2018, just as the court was about to empanel a jury for the case, Osgood requested that he be put to death because he said he believes in an “eye for an eye” approach.
The state executed Demetrius Frazier in February for the rape and murder of Pauline Brown in Birmingham in 1991. Earlier this year, Ivey commuted the sentence of Robin “Rocky” Myers from the death penalty to life in prison, saying she was not convinced of his guilt.
“This evening, the State of Alabama executed James Osgood for a crime that he committed 15 years ago,” said Alison Mollman, ACLU of Alabama legal director, the attorney who represented him. “Although Mr. Osgood had many years of appeals remaining in his case, he volunteered for execution to demonstrate his atonement and, in his words, to complete the sentence he received in his case—death by lethal injection. While he knows that no words or expressed remorse can repair the harm that his previous actions caused, he hopes that his decision brings the victim’s family closer to healing.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/James-Osgood-horizontal-2025-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-04-24 20:59:34.382003

(Nevada Gaming Commission stream screengrab)The Nevada Gaming Commission approved a stipulated agreement Thursday stemming from a complaint filed last week by the Nevada Gaming Control Board against MGM Resorts International. The complaint alleged MGM allowed three illegal bookmakers to gamble at the company’s properties, despite knowledge of, or suspicions about their sources of income. 
“One bad apple can ruin years of great work,” Nevada Gaming Commissioner and former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki said moments before the Commission approved the $8.5 million stipulated fine agreed to by MGM. 
But a few bad apples can prove costly, if not damaging, to the state’s largest casino conglomerate, which won praise from regulators, even as they imposed the massive fine for allowing the bookmakers to gamble on more than 700 separate days at the MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan, which the company later purchased.  
“2,600 customers in the last 10 years have been banned from your property,” Krolicki noted. “46,000 SARS (suspicious activity reports) have been filed. That is a culture of compliance. You should be proud of it.”
“I do feel that this is a much different situation than what we’ve seen in other cases,” Commissioner Rosa Solis-Rainey said. “MGM did have a strong culture of compliance, not just because they were already in trouble. It’s something that you had long before the trouble arose.”
MGM long sought to be a leader in gaming compliance, said Scott Scherer, a former Gaming Control Board member who represented the company before the commission and serves on its compliance committee. 
“Unfortunately, this case exposed one of the weaknesses in that program – when employees forget their responsibilities or decide not to fulfill those responsibilities, whether it is because they are going rogue, or because they think that’s what their customers, supervisors, or peers would want them to do.”
Scherer added that “all culpable employees had either left the company voluntarily before these issues came to light, or have been terminated…”  
“This is not an organization where compliance is a priority until it’s inconvenient for the business,” MGM General Counsel John McManus told the commission. “Compliance is what makes the business possible.”
McManus said although MGM could have done better, the company was consistent with industry best practices. 
“I’m not here to beat up on individual former employees who made poor decisions and mistakes that many of them, all of them really, paid a significant price for,” McManus said.
Former MGM Grand president Scott Sibella entered a guilty plea in federal court for failing to file a suspicious activity report in 2018.  He also agreed to give up his Nevada gaming license for five years. 
Commissioner Abbi Silver recused herself from the MGM item, citing her long friendship with Sibella. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating MGM and Resorts World. The Nevada Gaming Commission last month approved a stipulated agreement in which Resorts World agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine.

Arkansans must bring a valid driver’s license and pay a $12 fee to obtain a birth certificate. More information about obtaining birth certificates is available on the health department’s website. 
Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration officials earlier this week announced driver’s license offices in five cities would also have extended hours Saturday to assist Arkansans attempting to acquire their REAL IDs ahead of next month’s deadline. 
Offices in Little Rock, Fayetteville, Jonesboro, Texarkana and Monticello will be open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Appointments are recommended but not required, and can be scheduled on the finance department’s website.
REAL IDs began with a 2005 law passed by Congress in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
REAL IDs are signified by a gold star on a driver’s license or state-issued ID card. The state finance department has issued roughly 140,000 REAL IDs since Jan. 1, including 52,000 in March, bringing the statewide total to roughly 800,000, DFA Secretary Jim Hudson said in a Tuesday press conference.

Laramie, Platte and Teton County voters are among plaintiffs arguing several state election laws “impermissibly discriminate” against their constitutionally protected rights. 
The post Wyoming’s crossover-voting ban, closed primary elections challenged in court appeared first on WyoFile .","A group of Wyoming voters, former political candidates and a retired lawmaker are challenging several state election laws in a sweeping complaint filed in Laramie County District Court this month. 
Originally filed in August, the lawsuit initially sought to overturn the state’s prohibition on failed primary candidates appearing on the general election ballot as independents, known as a “sore loser law.” 
Now, the plaintiffs are also challenging the state’s closed primary election system and its limits on how and when Wyoming voters may affiliate with a political party, according to an amended complaint filed April 18. 
The laws violate the Wyoming Constitution’s guarantee of “political equality,” the plaintiffs argue, and “impermissibly discriminate against candidates and voters not affiliated with a major political party.” 
Among the plaintiffs are Matt Malcom of Laramie County and Jeff Thomas of Platte County. Both ran as Republicans for legislative seats but lost in the 2024 primary election. And state law prevented both from running as independent candidates in the general election. 
Jim Roscoe, a former independent lawmaker from Wilson, and Jim Rooks, a former Jackson Town Council member, are also plaintiffs in the case alongside Joshua Malcom, a registered voter of Laramie County, and Christina Kitchen, a registered voter of Teton County.

The suit names Chuck Gray, in his capacity as secretary of state, as the defendant. Gray did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by press time. Previously, he said he supported the law prohibiting primary election runner-ups from running as independents in the general election.
“The statute is there for a good reason,” Gray told WyoFile last August.
How we got here
For decades, Wyoming had a partially open primary election system. That meant voters were restricted to casting ballots in races that aligned with their political party affiliation, which they were allowed to change on election day and during most of the early voting period.
The one time voters couldn’t change affiliation included the two weeks leading up to election day. Then in 2023, Wyoming lawmakers extended that period to 96 days leading up to the primary election in order to ban what’s known as crossover-voting. 
The new timeline lines up with the candidate filing period, requiring voters to affiliate with a party before the slate of candidates has been finalized. 
Supporters said the law was needed to stop registered Democrats, minor party and unaffiliated voters from changing their party affiliation in order to participate as Republicans in the primary election. 
They also pointed to the 2018 primary election when Gov. Mark Gordon secured the Republican nomination in the governor’s race. Gordon’s opponents said he was only able to win due to the support of “crossover” Democrats. Those claims were shown to be statistically unfounded, but endured nonetheless.
Plaintiffs 
The new party affiliation law prevented Joshua Malcom, one of the plaintiffs, from casting a vote for his brother, Matthew, in the 2024 primary election for House District 61.
Joshua is a Laramie County unaffiliated voter because he “does not wish to be a member of any political party,” according to the suit. As a result, however, Joshua could not cast a vote for his preferred candidate, his brother, because he is not a registered Republican. 
Joshua was further precluded from doing so when Matthew was not allowed to run as an independent candidate, the lawsuit states. 
Enacted in 1973, Wyoming’s “sore loser law” stipulates “an unsuccessful candidate for office at a primary election whose name is printed on any party ballot may not accept nomination for the same office at the next general election.” 
In Teton County, plaintiff Christina Kitchen was prevented from voting for her brother-in-law, Jim Rooks, when he ran as a Democrat for the Teton County Commission in 2024. Kitchen was a registered Republican at the time. 
“The ability to change affiliation to vote in the primary of her choice has been and remains important to Kitchen because of her desire to vote for the person she deems most qualified and who supports her views rather than those who are affiliated with a particular political party,” according to the complaint. 
The law also prohibited Rooks, another plaintiff in the case, from running as an independent in the general election after he lost his primary election bid.

In 2022, Jim Roscoe declined to seek reelection for House District 22, which he’d represented as the Legislature’s sole independent. That lack of an affiliation has prevented him from participating in Wyoming’s primary elections. 
Roscoe believes, according to the lawsuit, that Wyoming’s major political parties “have become increasingly dominated by platforms and views of those in control of the national parties, extreme in their views, rhetoric, and actions, and unduly hostile to the members of opposing parties.”
As such, he “has an interest in and believes that giving Wyoming voters a greater number of candidate choices and more opportunities to elect independent candidates unaffiliated with any political party will help moderate the above-described trends he sees in Wyoming’s political parties.”
The complaint
The lawsuit highlights several sections of the Wyoming Constitution, including its “Equal Political Rights” provision. 
“Since equality in the enjoyment of natural and civil rights is only made sure through political equality, the laws of this state effecting the political rights and privileges of its citizens shall be without distinction of race, color, sex, or any other circumstance or condition whatsoever (emphasis added by plaintiffs) other than individual incompetency, or unworthiness duly ascertained by a court of competent jurisdiction,” Article 1, Section 3 reads. 
The complaint also points to other sections of the constitution that require the Legislature to craft laws so that “the names of all candidates for the same office, to be voted for at any election, shall be printed on the same ballot,” and that “elections shall be open, free and equal, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent an untrammeled exercise of the right of suffrage.” 
As such, the plaintiffs are asking the court for a declaratory judgment, or to clarify their legal rights and the obligations of the state.

Screenshot via Court TVBURLINGTON — A New Hampshire man has been sentenced to 42½ years in prison for shooting and killing his wife in a camper in Bolton. They had traveled to Vermont to mark their one-year wedding anniversary. Judge John Pacht handed down the jail term to 45-year-old Joseph Ferlazzo Jr. during a nearly daylong hearing Thursday in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. A jury convicted Ferlazzo of first-degree murder in December in the fatal shooting of his 22-year-old wife, Emily Ferlazzo, in October 2021. First-degree murder carries a sentence of 35 years to life in prison. The sentence of more than four decades behind bars for Joseph Ferlazzo was less than what the prosecution urged — at least 50 years — and more than what the defense had sought, which was 15 years. “Emily Ferlazzo had a beautiful, beautiful voice and I’m not just referring to her singing which we heard today,” Pacht said as he delivered the sentence, recalling a video played of her earlier in Thursday’s hearing.“It extended to all areas of her life,” the judge said. “It was a voice that deserved to be heard. It was a voice that deserved to grow, mature, and if necessary to heal, and it deserved to do that for a long happy life.”But, Pacht said, that didn’t happen as her life ended far too soon. “And,” the judge said, “it was cut short at the hands of Joseph Ferlazzo.” Pacht called it a “horrendous” crime and a case of “extreme” domestic violence. READ MORE





 


Jury convicts New Hampshire man of first-degree murder in fatal shooting of his wife in Bolton

Murder and cover-up During the trial, the prosecution had argued that Joseph Ferlazzo shot and killed Emily Ferlazzo after an argument in their camper van, hours after they arrived in Bolton to visit with relatives and celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary. In reaching its verdict in December, the jury rejected Joseph Ferlazzo’s testimony that he acted in self-defense. The shooting, according to the prosecution, took place after Emily Ferlazzo told him she no longer wanted to be with him. A video statement Joseph Ferlazzo provided to police after his arrest in which he admitted to shooting and killing his wife made no mention of a self-defense claim. Ferlazzo was arrested four days after the killing, when he was spotted by a state trooper at a St. Albans convenience store, according to charging documents in the case and trial testimony. After the killing, according to the prosecution, he worked to cover up the crime and claimed that his wife was missing. Police later found her dismembered remains inside the camper van. Ferlazzo, a Northfield, New Hampshire, resident at the time of his arrest, had been employed as a tattoo artist. Emily Ferlazzo had worked as a nurse. Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George, who prosecuted the case along with Deputy State’s Attorney Sally Adams, said during the hearing Thursday that asking for the prison term of 50 years to life for Joseph Ferlazzo was not a decision made lightly.George said she took into consideration the violent acts he committed, the many lies he told, the cover-up he tried to carry out after the killing, including the dismemberment of his wife’s body, and his attempts to shift blame for his actions to Emily Ferlazzo that were “not corroborated by any shred of evidence.”During her sentencing argument for a much lesser prison term, Margaret Jansch, Joseph Ferlazzo’s attorney, told the judge that her client had no prior criminal record. She also called Thomas Powell, a forensic psychologist, to take the witness stand. He testified that he found Joseph Ferlazzo had displayed “elements of a personality disorder.”  ‘Strong’ and ‘compassionate’Emily Ferlazzo’s family members and friends filled the courtroom seats Thursday in the gallery behind the prosecution, many wearing red shirts emblazoned with her name and the words, “Love Shouldn’t Hurt.” Some delivered victim impact statements while others had a victim advocate read them on their behalf.They described Emily as a person who cared for others, loved animals, enjoyed singing, dancing and all things “glittery” and “sparkly.” They also spoke of the hole her death had left in their lives, from brothers who no longer had their sister to a best friend who lost the person she confided in. A video was played in the courtroom of Adrienne Bass, Emily Ferlazzo’s mother, speaking of her daughter, punctuated by photos and videos from Emily Ferlazzo’s life.  Bass didn’t use Joseph Ferlazzo’s name during her statement, referring to him as “the convicted,” and she talked about how he controlled and abused her daughter during their relationship. Bass said her daughter was “strong” and “compassionate,” and loved children and dreamed of having babies of her own one day.“The big sister, the only daughter, first granddaughter and great-granddaughter, niece and cousin, a best friend – these were the labels given to Emily in her life,” Bass said of her daughter. “A mother, an auntie, a grandmother, a best friend – the labels that she was denied the day she was murdered.”  Jansch, Joseph Ferlazzo’s attorney, read in the courtroom about a half-dozen letters from people who knew her client and wrote in support of him, from his friends who knew him for several years to a past cellmate.Ferlazzo also spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, appearing to read from a paper he was holding.“This event doesn’t define me or who I am,” Ferlazzo said, adding, “I admit that my reaction was too strong and it’s haunted me every day and every night.”He then addressed Emily Ferlazzo’s mother directly though he didn’t look at her as she sat about 20 feet away from him.“Adrienne, I’m so incredibly sorry for what happened,” Joseph Ferlazzo said, and then continued to suggest that his actions that night were in self-defense. “The whole thing was so fast.”As he was speaking, Emily Ferlazzo’s mother got up and walked out of the courtroom, as did several other of her family members.Pacht, the judge, spoke directly to Joseph Ferlazzo as he closed out the hearing.“Mr. Ferlazzo, there are things you can do good while you are incarcerated,” Pacht said to him. “Live your life and try and see where you can grow.”  His attorney said following Thursday’s hearing that an appeal was expected. Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘A voice that deserved to be heard’: judge recalls victim and sentences her killer to 42½ years.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/joseph-farlazzo.jpg?fit=1024%2C708&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 20:04:58.549812

Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
Senate Bill 5390 would raise the price of the annual state public lands pass to $45 from $30 for two vehicles. Transaction fees can apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. 
The Discover Pass allows motor vehicle access to more than 100 state parks and hundreds of other recreation sites on state land. 
The increase would take effect on Oct. 1, 2025. 
An earlier version of the bill would’ve upped the price in July. The House also stripped language from a Senate-approved version of the bill that would have permitted people to use the passes in up to three different vehicles instead of the two allowed under current law.
In the House, the bill passed on Tuesday on a 52-46 vote, with seven Democrats joining Republicans in opposition. The Senate voted 27-21 to accept the House’s rewrite on Thursday, with two Democrats and all Republicans voting against the bill.
The bill would still allow for various discounts for seniors, disabled veterans, families of foster children, and volunteers.
This would be the first increase to the price of the pass since it was introduced about 14 years ago, after budget cuts to state parks and recreation areas around the 2008 recession. 
Democratic lawmakers say the increase would help protect state parks from drastic cuts amid the multibillion-dollar deficit the state is currently facing. 
Revenue from pass sales goes to Washington State Parks, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of Natural Resources, with Washington State Parks receiving the bulk of the revenue.  
The bill also calls for the Office of Financial Management to review the cost of the pass every four years and recommend to the Legislature if adjustments to the price need to be made to account for inflation. 
A work group would also be created to review the efficiency of the funding for state parks and recreational areas and submit a report to the Legislature by Dec. 1, 2026.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tent-camping-campground-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-04-24 20:04:58.549812

A federal judge on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of state Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, after a jury deadlocked in their deliberations over whether Jones agreed to take bribes from red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-government cooperator Omar Maani in 2019, then lied to the FBI about it.

The senator, who’s served 16 years in Springfield since he replaced his father — former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr. — was charged with three counts of bribery and lying to the FBI. Before they began deliberating Monday, jurors heard eight days of arguments, evidence and testimony, including from Jones himself.

The jury sent an initial note indicating they were at a stalemate on two of the counts late Wednesday, which was met with a legally required instruction from the judge encouraging further deliberations Thursday morning. But nearly 23 hours into deliberations early Thursday afternoon, the jury sent another note telling the judge they’d deadlocked on all three counts.

“The jury cannot come to a unanimous verdict on all three counts,” the note read. “No one is willing to surrender their honest beliefs.”

After polling individual members of the jury while white noise blasted through the courtroom’s speakers, U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood said the majority of jurors believed further deliberations would be unlikely to change anything.

The judge then declared a mistrial over the objections of Jones’ attorneys, who wanted the jury to keep deliberating.

“The lack of unanimity in jury room is evidence the government has not met its burden beyond a reasonable doubt,” Jones attorney Joshua Adams told the judge.

But the judge said case law did not support forcing the jury to keep deliberating for that reason and cited the number of hours it had spent in the jury room and the complexity of the case as weighing in favor of a mistrial, which prosecutors supported. She then set the next hearing in the case for June 10.

Jones’ face was placid as Judge Wood went through her rationale to declare a mistrial. While he had several family members present for each day of trial, the courtroom gallery was filled mostly with members of the media.

On his way out of the courtroom, Jones remarked that now he’d have to “go back to work.”

Flanked by his attorneys, Jones gave a brief statement before leaving the Dirksen Federal Courthouse with his stepmother Thursday evening.

“I want to thank the judge, thank the jury, thank the prosecution and most importantly, thank my lawyers,” he said. “I look forward to another fight.”

Jones’ father, the former Senate president, attended most days of trial, listening as his son was accused of benefitting from nepotism and he was accused of having practicing politics that included accepting personal favors.

It’s the third high-profile federal public corruption trial in seven months to end in a hung jury. In February, jurors deliberating former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan’s case deadlocked on six of the 23 counts while convicting him on 10 and acquitting on seven. And in September, a judge had to declare a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on all five counts alleging the former president of AT&T Illinois bribed Madigan in 2017.

In closing arguments Monday, Jones’ attorney Vic Henderson accused the feds of employing the “Dirksen two-step,"" referring to the Dirksen Federal Courthouse where a parade of elected officials have either gone to trial or pleaded guilty over the years. He asked jurors to set aside any bias they might have against Chicago politicians given the “long history” of corruption cases brought to the courthouse.

“It has happened time and time and time again in this building,” Henderson said. “So when yet another government official comes here and is charged, there’s this feeling, ‘Here we go again.’ ... But judge asked each and every one of you if you can be fair.”

Jones last week made the risky decision to testify in his own defense. The last time a sitting state official took the witness stand in their own corruption trial was 20 years ago, when then-state Rep. Patricia Bailey testified in a bench trial before being convicted on election fraud and forgery charges.

During their closing arguments Monday, prosecutors poked holes in Jones’ claims both on the witness stand and to the FBI during a Sept. 24, 2019, interview at his home that Maani made him uncomfortable. Jones last week told the jury that he was trying to avoid taking money from Maani, saying he gave off the vibe of a “used car salesman” and that he was aware Maani was trying to bribe him.

As the pair dined at Jones’ favorite Chicago steakhouse on July 17, 2019, Maani pushed Jones to give him a number for a campaign contribution. After demurring, Jones finally came up with a figure: $5,000.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” Jones said after Maani pushed him to come up with a number. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office and I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job while he’s in school. … Do you all have any positions available?”

In closing arguments, Henderson said at that point in the dinner, the senator still believed Maani was trying to participate in a “legitimate fundraiser,” and was just trying to make good on a promise he made to help his former intern find a part-time job.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri said the fact that Jones was still willing to move forward with Maani even after the FBI cooperator hinted that the contribution and job would be part of a bribe indicate that Jones had no objections — despite his testimony six years later.

Kolluri showed the jury an email Jones sent to Maani the week after their July 2019 meeting.

“Had a great time at dinner last week, looking forward to the many more good times my friend,” Jones wrote in his July 24, 2019, email to Maani that contained his former intern’s resume.

“Is that a person who feels uncomfortable around Omar Maani?” Kolluri asked the jury. “Is that evidence of a person who doesn’t want to accept a bribe? No. This is evidence of someone who knows and is a willing participant in this process.”

Road to trial

Even without testifying in his own defense, Jones is also an anomaly as the only sitting state official in more than a decade to take his case to trial; in 2014, then-state Rep. Derrick Smith was convicted on bribery charges. And while not a state official, former Chicago Alderman Patrick Daley Thompson went to trial while still a member of the City Council and resigned the same day of his conviction in 2022.

But the feds’ wide-ranging public corruption probe first made public in 2018 has mostly resulted in elected officials either resigning or pleading guilty after being hit with charges.

Jones, however, told the jury last week that he decided to fight his charges even before they were filed. During a September 2021 meeting at federal offices downtown, the senator and his then-attorney watched the hours of secretly recorded meetings with Maani and the September 2019 FBI interview.

Jones claimed to the jury that after seeing the tapes in full, he concluded the feds “tried to twist what I was saying” when he was initially shown “snippets” of the recordings in February 2020 after his attorney received a letter that charges were imminent.

When charges finally came down in September 2022, Jones declined to resign, despite pressure from Senate leadership and even Gov. JB Pritzker. He won another four-year term to the Illinois Senate in November of that year, although the senator has remained barred from his previous leadership roles, including chairing a committee.

In addition to Jones’ surprise testimony, the jury also heard from Maani, whose own bribery charge was dismissed in 2023 in fulfillment of his deferred prosecution agreement. While on the witness stand, Maani acknowledged having paid bribes for nearly his entire career, which continued with the FBI’s blessing and assistance after he began cooperating with the feds in January 2018.

Maani’s cooperation led to guilty pleas from a handful of public officials involved with Maani and his businesses, including then-Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who received $75,000 in cash from Maani, never knowing the cash was provided by the FBI. At a dinner between the three in late June 2019, Sandoval hinted at benefits he received from Maani and told Jones that Maani “wants to be your friend.”

Maani testified that he worried Jones’ proposed legislation calling for a statewide study of red-light cameras would be a “prelude to a ban,” which would decimate his industry. Jones had refiled similar legislation for several years in a row, but the only time it got close to becoming law was in 2017 when the scope of the study was negotiated down to just the city of Chicago.

Since Maani’s company SafeSpeed operated only in the Chicago suburbs, Maani wanted Jones to limit his 2019 legislation in the same way.

After Maani agreed to both Jones’ $5,000 suggestion and the job request for his former intern at their July 2019 dinner, the senator then asked Maani, “What can I do about Chicago?”

According to the feds, that was the moment Jones agreed to the bribe.



[caption id=""attachment_64034"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] FBI cooperating witness Omar Maani was a co-owner of SafeSpeed, which operated red-light camera systems in Chicago’s southwest suburbs, including at the intersection of Archer and Harlem avenues in Summit. Maani was worried that state Sen. Emil Jones III’s repeated legislative proposals for a statewide study on red-light cameras was a “prelude to a ban.”[/caption]


Job for former intern

Prosecutors also called two FBI agents who worked on the case, as well as Jones’ former intern, Christopher Katz. In the summer of 2019, Katz had just received his associate’s degree and was about to start an architecture program at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Katz told the jury he needed “some money coming in” to help pay for school and was seeking Jones’ assistance to get a part-time job.

Read more: Sen. Jones sent spending money to former intern before getting him job feds say was a bribe

Jones testified that he’d asked Maani for help because he’d seen dozens of college students working at SafeSpeed when he was invited to tour the company’s offices in April 2019. Though Maani initially said Katz could work as a “reviewer” of red-light camera footage, by his next meeting with Jones a few weeks later, Maani told Jones he was reticent about having SafeSpeed hire Katz.

“It looks really goofy and concerning that we’re now hiring his intern with someone who’s sponsoring negative legislation against us,” Maani testified earlier this month.

Instead, Maani floated the idea of hiring Katz to work for him directly on a research project. And a few days later, Maani called Jones to tell him that he planned to put Katz “on my payroll” even though he didn’t have much work for him to do at the time.

“I just wanted to make sure that he’s the type of kid that, you know, when he gets a check and he’s not doing anything right away, that he’s, you know, he’s not gonna be spooked by that,” Maani said on an Aug. 12, 2019, wiretapped call. “He’s not gonna be weird and stuff. … Is he — would he be cool with that for a while? I mean, does he get it? Does he understand this?”

“Yeah, but um, make sure we find him some work,” Jones replied.

Katz ended up receiving a total of $1,800 in weekly payments from Maani over the course of six weeks until the feds’ investigation — and Maani’s role in it — was made public on Sept. 24, 2019.

“The defendant knew this was not a normal job,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam said Monday, pointing out Jones had told Katz he “got the job” in mid-July even before he’d sent Katz’s resume to Maani. “What that means is the defendant knew this was part of the bribe.”

A ‘quiet’ campaign contribution

In addition to being cautious about hiring Katz at SafeSpeed, Maani also told Jones he needed to “conceal” any campaign contribution he might make, telling the senator he was wary about his colleagues growing suspicious or generating a story for the news media.

At their third and final dinner on Aug. 8, 2019, Maani asked Jones how he could contribute to the senator’s campaign without it having to be reported on public campaign finance records.

Read more: FBI mole told Sen. Emil Jones III to suggest ‘creative’ way to accept $5K lest it ‘look goofy’

Jones suggested that Maani could help sponsor a job fair in his district, mentioning sponsors often pay for food or giveaways at the events. Jones explained during his testimony that in-kind contributions like those under $150 don’t need to be reported, and claimed he was thinking that Maani would pay for some boxes of pizza or a case of bottled water, though he didn’t mention the $150 threshold during their dinner conversation.

“Okay, and there’s enough stuff for me to cover for five grand?” Maani asked?

""You don’t necessarily have to — ” Jones began to answer before Maani cut him off, telling the senator he didn’t care how it was done, so long as “everything’s kinda quiet.”

After again telling Maani that event sponsors usually just paid for food, Jones again turned the conversation to his former intern.

“I’m not really worried so much with you helping me,” Jones said. “Just help Chris out.”

Jones’ attorney Henderson on Monday pointed to that moment in closing arguments as proof Jones was attempting to dissuade Maani from giving him any money. Henderson reiterated that Jones never brought up the contribution after it dawned on him that Maani was trying to bribe him.

“Why would somebody on the take say don’t give me any money?” Henderson asked. “Why would somebody who doesn’t know their calls are being listened to say, ‘don’t give me any money?’ Why? Because he’s not on the take.”

But Ardam said Maani’s references to wanting to “conceal” the contribution were “giant red flags.”

“The defendant knew this was a bribe,” Ardam said Monday. “A bribe is a crime, and crimes need to be hidden.”

Alleged lies to FBI

But when a pair of FBI agents knocked on Jones’ door the morning of Sept. 24, 2019, Jones denied having discussed with Maani how a campaign contribution could be made without having it publicly reported.

That was one of three specific lies the feds allege the senator told during the interview, which was secretly recorded. The agents told Jones they were investigating Sandoval, who later died after pleading guilty, but did not reveal they were also investigating Jones.

When Special Agent Timothy O’Brien asked whether he and Maani came up with an amount Maani was going to donate, Jones said, “no, no no.”

Kolluri on Monday told the jury that Jones’ response to that question “was intentional.”

“He knew he’d broken the law,"" the prosecutor said. “You’ve heard the recording of that interview and you know he was not truthful.”

In the interview, Jones also denied knowing that Katz was getting paid, despite he and Maani agreeing that $15 an hour was fair at their last dinner six weeks prior.

The feds also say Jones lied about his promise to “protect” Maani and SafeSpeed from then-state Rep. David McSweeney, R-Barrington Hills, a friend of Jones’ who was also in favor of legislation to study red-light cameras but only because he wanted to see the industry abolished in Illinois.

Kolluri on Monday told the jury the FBI agents were just two of the people or circumstances Jones blamed for landing him in court.

“Not once did he take any accountability for any of this or express any regret,” the prosecutor said. “But most importantly, he lied to you.”

Kolluri said that in addition to lying to the FBI, Jones lied on the witness stand.

“He had an answer for almost everything, the same thing he said Omar Maani did,” Kolluri said, hearkening back to Jones’ description of Maani in testimony last week. “But the problem with lying is it always catches up to you.”

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Hecklers interrupted a speech Thursday by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at a conference on opioid addiction in Nashville.
The Rx and Illicit Drug Summit 2025 drew law enforcement officials, addiction prevention counselors, social workers and public health officers to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center for the three-day event.
For years, Kennedy has drawn ire and disapproval for his anti-vaccine messages and, more recently, for belittling comments about people with autism and budget cuts in his department.
“Believe science!” shouted a protester before security rushed him from the room. Another protester held aloft a sign that read, “Vaccines save lives.”
Kennedy’s speech was apolitical and focused on his own history in recovery from an addiction to heroin and his recommendations for dealing with the nation’s opioid crisis — many of which focused less on medical or treatment solutions and more on the need to build community, embrace spirituality and take personal responsibility.
After touting a $4 billion budget at HHS, Kennedy said that “money alone won’t fix this.”
“We have a whole generation of children who have lost faith in our country and their future,” Kennedy said. “Policy should reestablish hope for the future.”

The Trump administration — and Kennedy — have proposed to restructure HHS, including dismantling the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), cutting research funding and funding for addiction treatment and mental health care.
“All these changes are impacting people on the ground,” Pleus said. “People who are struggling with addiction can’t get help already and now they’re going to have an even harder time.”
The conference was sponsored by HMP Global, which provides continuing medical education.
Past speakers have included former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump spoke to the group in 2019 during his first term in office.
In addition to Kennedy, 2025 speakers included U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Tennessee senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Dr. Ralph Alvarado, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Researchers at the University of Utah recently published a first-of-its-kind study that measures the impact dust has on melting snow in the Colorado River Basin.
Dust has long been credited to accelerating snowmelt in the Intermountain West. Blowing from arid regions and settling in the mountains, the dust darkens the snow, lowering its albedo — essentially, darker snow doesn’t reflect the sunlight as well, leading to more heat absorption and speeding up the melting process.
It’s particularly prevalent in the Colorado River Basin, with large mountain ranges like the San Juans, La Sals and Maroon Bells pushed up against dry expanses of desert. As drought continues to impact the region, dust events have worsened, depleting the snowpack at faster rates and complicating an already precarious situation for the Colorado River and the 40 million people who get their drinking water from it.
And while previous papers have recorded the impact dust has on snowmelt, University of Utah researchers are the first to study an area as large as the Colorado River headwaters, which spans multiple states. According to the university, there are no snowmelt models — streamflow forecasts in mountain basins essential for areas that rely on snowpack for water — that take dust into account.
“The degree of darkening caused by dust has been related to water forecasting errors. The water comes earlier than expected, and this can have real world impacts — for example if the ground is still frozen it’s too early for farmers to use. A reservoir manager can store early snowmelt, but they need the information to plan for that,” said McKenzie Skiles, associate professor at the university’s School of Environment, Society and Sustainability. “If we can start to build dust into the snowmelt forecast models, it will make water management decision-making more informed.”
Stiles is a co-lead author of the study, which was published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters in March.
Stiles and other researchers analyzed 23 years of satellite images, from 2021 to 2023, to observe snow darkened by dust in the spring months. They found that dust accelerated snowmelt in the Colorado River Basin every spring, even during less-dusty years.
During runoff season, typically between April and May, the snowpack melts about 10 to 15 millimeters each day. According to the study, dust deposition can accelerate snowmelt by 1 millimeter per hour during peak sunlight — during a “high-dust” year, that can factor out to about 10 extra millimeters each day.
“It’s not just how much dust gets deposited over a season, but also the timing of dust deposition that matters,” said Patrick Naple, doctoral candidate of geography at the University of Utah and lead author of the study. “Dust is very effective at speeding up melt because it’s most frequently deposited in the spring when days are getting longer and the sun more intense. Even an extra millimeter per hour can make the snowpack disappear several weeks earlier than without dust deposition.”
One of the most comprehensive analyses of dust and snowmelt yet, the university says this research could improve water forecasting and allocation for communities that rely on the Colorado River.

The bill (HB 317), sponsored by Miami-Dade Republican Tom Fabricio, has bitterly divided law enforcement in Florida. The Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association have both came out in opposition to  the bill. But the Florida Fraternal Order of Police and Florida Police Benevolent Association support it.
In committee meetings and again on the House floor on Thursday, Fabricio emphasized that his bill does not preclude individuals from making an anonymous complaint. However, the bill says that before any interrogations of the accused officer are to commence, that officer must be informed about the identity of the individual making the complaint.
Several House Democrats expressed concerns about the legislation.
“This bill builds walls around misconduct and discourages good officers and community members from speaking up,” said Broward County Rep. Daryl Campbell. “Under this bill, no officer can be investigated unless they receive a copy of a signed, sworn complaint. That sounds reasonable, until you remember how rare it is for whistleblowers, whether it’s civilians or fellow officers, to feel safe on the record, especially when it’s about someone within their own department.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOrlando Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis said, “False accusations are serious, but so is unchecked power.”
“This bill doesn’t protect justice, it protects silence,” she continued, adding that the Legislature last year passed measures severely restricting civilian review boards and enabling police, firefighters, and and paramedics to establish 25-foot no-go-zones around themselves while working.
“The Florida Police Chiefs Association and the Sheriffs Association both oppose this bill — that should tell us something,” said Bracy Davis. “I don’t just legislate for Tallahassee, I legislate through the lens of my district, a district representing all people, inclusive of of black, brown, and yes, blue lives. Let me clear: I back the blue, wholeheartedly, but I also back the Black and the brown.”
But Hillsborough County Republican Rep. Danny Alvarez, who in his job outside of the Legislature serves as general counsel for the Tampa Police Benevolent Association, blasted some of the Democrats’ remarks.
“At some point, you have to stop attacking the 99.8 [percent] and start supporting them,” he said. “At some point, you have to realize that the rhetoric that is absolutely anti-cop in this chamber has to be checked by your desire to have a safe and secure society with an accountability process that exists today. Cops are one of the most regulated people you have ever seen, and if you don’t believe that, go be one.”
The House passed the measure, 93-16, with several Democrats joining Republicans.
However, the Senate bill (SB 516), sponsored by Hillsborough County Republican Jay Collins, was never heard in any committee of that chamber, meaning the measure is effectively dead for this session.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislators authorized a few court closures Thursday while approving the biennial court officers bill. It’s the first time lawmakers are eliminating judges that are underutilized.
“Statewide, we have the right number of judicial officers,” said Fishers Republican Rep. Chris Jeter. “The question is, are they in the right places?”
Two weeks ago, the Senate added language taking away judges in 11 mostly rural counties. But the conference committee report — approved 83-5 in the House and 45-4 in the Senate — eliminates only one court in Blackford County, one court in Monroe County and one magistrate in Jennings County.
It also removes several unfilled magistrate positions in Marion County.
House Bill 1144 — which adds judges and magistrates in Elkhart, Hamilton, Lawrence and Vigo counties — had moved through the entire session without language abolishing courts.
Then, on April 10, hours before a committee deadline, an amendment was added in the Senate Appropriations Committee eliminating one court each in Blackford, Carroll, Gibson, Greene, Jennings, Monroe, Newton, Owen, Pulaski, Rush and Scott counties, along with six juvenile magistrate positions in Marion County.
State panel recommends judicial reallocation from low- to high-need counties

This provision was estimated to save the state approximately $748,885 in Fiscal Year 2027 and up to $2.75 M in Fiscal Year 2032, according to a fiscal analysis.
Lawmakers from those areas were deluged with concern from constituents.
The general idea of reallocation was discussed in a study committee in October 2024. Essentially, Indiana uses a weighted caseload study that assesses how much judicial time is needed for different types of cases. Then it looks at how many cases are filed to determine how many judges and magistrates are needed for the caseload.
For years, lawmakers have added state-funded court officers when the statistics have shown more judges are needed to handle additional cases. But as population has shifted away from some rural counties, they have never taken a judge away — even if the weighted caseload shows they have too many court officers.
The weighted caseload study shows, for instance, that Monroe County has 10 judges but only needs 7.87. Blackford County has two judges, but the study shows it needs less than one.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said “these are never easy decisions” but that population shifts mean some counties aren’t seeing as much crime or as many lawsuits.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said he doesn’t disagree with the premise but said the process should have been set out well in advance. He noted the House never heard testimony on eliminating judges.
He said Monroe County is losing a court because one of the judges announced she is retiring.
Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, thanked his colleagues for giving the Carroll County courts a reprieve. He said the Delphi double-murder case “really upset” the court system there.

House Bill 267, known as “Bobby’s Law,” has passed both chambers and been sent to Gov. Greg Gianforte, who is widely expected to sign it. 
The bill, carried by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, establishes the crime of aggravated vehicular homicide while under the influence. A conviction would mandate a three-year minimum prison sentence, a minimum fine of $10,000 and prevents a judge from delaying or suspending the sentence. 
“This bill sends a clear message: If you kill someone in this state while driving, and you’re extremely impaired, that you will finally face real justice,” Mitchell said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month. 
A recent Forbes rating of the worst states for drunk driving, based on the percent of traffic deaths caused by drunk drivers, ranked Montana No. 1, with 8.57 DUI-related fatalities per 100,000 drivers. 
Data from the Montana Department of Transportation shows that during the last decade, between 33% and 45% of all car crash fatalities in the state involve alcohol impairment, with Yellowstone, Big Horn, Missoula and Flathead Counties having the highest percentage of roadway fatalities involving alcohol. 
But beyond the data, the bill was personal for Mitchell, who was friends and neighbors with Bobby Dewbre, who was killed by a drunk driver in 2023. 
“The worst part of all this is that the person who killed him barely faced any consequences,” Mitchell said. “…I’ve worked with Bobby Dewbre’s family to craft a law to seek justice for other families who may face this horrific experience.”
More than 80 people testified in favor of the bill during its hearing before the House committee, and dozens showed up again to testify in the Senate.
Elizabeth McBride, Dewbre’s mother, and other members of his family testified about getting the call about her son’s death and what her family and community went through when the driver was charged with two misdemeanors. 
“We’re not suggesting that people stop drinking, but we are imploring you to send the clear message that getting drunk and then getting behind the wheel will not be tolerated,” McBride said. “…Drunk driving is a choice. It is not legal, and it is 100% avoidable.”
McBride helped found a nonprofit called Montana Bar Fairies, dedicated to “change the drinking and driving culture in Montana.” The organization, which has chapters in four counties, strongly advocated for Bobby’s law and works with local communities and bars to boost DUI awareness. 
One part of the group’s outreach involves sending out volunteers every weekend to leave $5 gift cards to local coffee shops on cars left in bar parking lots overnight, a small incentive they hope builds big results. 
Patricia Hinchey, director of the Bozeman chapter of Montana Bar Fairies, said that growing up in the state, she always had an earlier curfew than her friends due to the high number of impaired drivers on the road. 
“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to realize how unsafe Montana’s roadways are. Driving should not be something that makes me so fearful, but I’m scared to drive, not just at night, but at any time of the day,” Hinchey said. “This needs to change.”
The law, Mitchell said, fixes a gap in the legal system and increases accountability for individuals who make the choice to drive under the influence.
“We’ve heard from the Department of Transportation, law enforcement agencies, police groups, from county attorneys, bar owners, business owners and just average everyday residents across the state,” he said. The new law will show that “our state is finally committed to reducing these incidents and making roads safer for all residents and visitors.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1290950900-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 20:04:58.549812

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)As New Mexico’s population of seniors continues to grow, the state’s aging department is proposing expanded initiatives to help seniors maintain their autonomy while also supporting family caregivers.
The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department released a draft of its 2025-2029 State Plan on Aging on Thursday and is receiving feedback from the public and stakeholders through May 15. The document states that it is expected to go into effect in October 2025.
The plan details three goals to help New Mexicans age in place and reduce instances of abuse and neglect, including: administering programs to support seniors aging in their own homes, as well as their caregivers; responding to “social determinants of health,” such as food security, housing security and access to healthcare; and reducing instances of abuse, neglect and exploitation in the state while also preserving seniors’ autonomy.
According to the previous plan, more than 377,700 New Mexicans were 65 and older in 2018. This number grew to more than 391,200 in 2020 and is projected to grow by 122% by 2030, meaning more than 475,600 New Mexicans will be 65 and over. The current draft plan states that New Mexico is currently the 13th state in the U.S. with the highest percentage of population falling into this age category.
“In the past five years a lot has changed including the growth of our aging population and increased needs such as transportation access and caregiver support,” an unattributed written statement from the aging department to Source NM reads. “The new plan strives to address these changing needs including standing up new programs like New MexiCare that support family and friend caregivers.”
The New MexiCare program provides caregivers with financial and training support to then help aging New Mexicans remain in their own homes. The program is currently available in 31 of the state’s 33 counties, excepting Doña Ana and Bernalillo counties, but aging department representatives have said previously the goal is to eventually expand the program into those counties as well.
The department also noted in its statement that only an estimated 22% of the 60 and older population receive services such as home-delivered meals, congregate meals, transportation, case management, adult day care, respite services and homemaker services – all of which fall under the Older Americans Act Title III services and are provided by the Area Agencies on Aging in the state. 
“The advocacy responsibilities remain a quintessential aspect of the work that ALTSD engages in daily,” the statement reads.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)FAMU has named four finalists for president, with a final vote scheduled next month. How the search committee developed its list is under question, however, with some trustees saying there are “clouds hanging” over the process.
Under Florida law, presidential search committees, comprising university trustees, stakeholders, and a university system Board of Governors (BOG) member, work on a confidential search before presenting a list of finalists to the public and trustees.
FAMU trustees questioned Thursday whether to investigate the legality of the search so far. 
“Certainly, there may be a rumor mill,” FAMU Board of Trustees Chair Kristin Harper said during a virtual meeting Thursday, adding the board has an obligation to address those rumors. 
FAMU released its list of finalists Tuesday. the Tallahassee Democrat published the names on Monday. Harper questioned how the names of finalists were released to the newspaper before the university formally announced them, considering the nondisclosure agreement signed by the members of the committee. 
Harper called it “grossly unfair” that the names were released before the university announced them.
The list has four finalists, including University of Maryland Eastern Shore Provost Rondall Allen, University of Central Florida VP for Administration and Finance Gerald Hector, FAMU Chief Operating Officer Donald Palm, and former Florida Board of Education Chair Marva Johnson. 
The Democrat reported: “There has been wide speculation that [search committee chair Deveron] Gibbons insisted on adding Johnson” to an already existing list of three finalists. 
The Board of Governors is requesting information related to the search, according to FAMU trustees, although that request is not part of a formal investigation and does not pause the search, they said. The Phoenix did not receive a response to a Thursday request for comment from the BOG. 
The scope of the BOG request for information was unknown Thursday.

Pause or not?
Trustees debated whether it would be proper for FAMU to conduct its own investigation and pause the search before final interviews and a vote is taken during the week of May 12. 
“There are too many clouds hanging over this process,” trustee Earnie Ellison said. He served on the Florida Atlantic University Board of Trustees when that university suspended a presidential search due to ethics concerns.
“We are not just potted plants,” FAMU Trustee Belvin Perry Jr., a former judge, said, adding that the board has its own fiduciary duty. 
Gibbons insisted FAMU “has conducted a transparent, inclusive process.”
“This is almost laughable. We have run a very clean process,” Gibbons said, objecting to a pause on the search. 
“We are being reactionary to a group of people who are hurling around rumors and innuendo,” Gibbons said, decrying a “witch-hunt.”
Eight trustees voted against pausing the search to hire an independent consultant to investigate the process, while five supported doing so.
From outside the process, Leon County Commissioner Bill Proctor, a political science instructor at FAMU, has called one finalist “weak” but did not specify which one, the Democrat reported. Proctor said “the public now believes the process of a search is a farce,” and called on trustees to “peer through the haze of this Hanky Panky Express and restart the search process.”
The search began after former President Larry Robinson stepped down after announcing a $237 million gift that was later found to be fraudulent. 
While lawmakers at the Capitol struggle to reach an agreement on a state budget, Trustee Kelvin Lawson said FAMU is “on thin ice” as lawmakers decide how much money the school will receive next fiscal year. 
“I don’t think we have enough facts or precedent to stop or slow this process,” Lawson said.
Presidential search tension
Presidential searches have been a major topic of discussion in the Florida Capitol this session, with the House passing a bill with broad support that would eliminate the confidentiality of presidential searches and end BOG involvement.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has worked to install political allies as presidents of public universities, said he will veto the bill if it gets to his desk.
Johnson was appointed to the Florida Board of Education by former Gov. Rick Scott and was appointed by DeSantis to serve on the Florida Scholar’s Academy Board of Trustees. That’s an education program for juvenile offenders.

Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.

Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.











It's not just health insurance. It's a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”

Bias and language barriers

Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”

‘Ripple effect’

Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

Free.,Trump DOJ asks U.S. Supreme Court to reverse ruling allowing transgender troops,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-doj-asks-us-supreme-court-reverse-ruling-allowing-transgender-troops,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday to block a lower court’s decision allowing transgender individuals to continue enlisting and serving in the armed forces.Administration officials are seeking a stay of a broad district court ruling in late March that applied to all troops rather than only to those who challenged President Donald Trump’s executive order in court. The U.S. Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit upheld the lower court’s ruling Friday.The government contends its policy does not discriminate against an entire class of people, but rather finds a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria to be disqualifying. Gender dysphoria is recognized by medical professionals as distress caused by an incongruence between a person’s gender identity and their sex at birth.In its application to the Supreme Court Thursday afternoon, the Department of Justice argued it’s likely to succeed in the case because the newly adopted policy does not differ widely from those in place under former secretaries of defense.“The policy was based in part on the findings of a panel of experts convened during the first Trump Administration, which found that service by individuals with gender dysphoria was contrary to ‘military effectiveness and lethality,’” wrote John Sauer, Trump’s solicitor general.Sauer also argued the district court’s universal order violated the power of the president.Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27, asserting the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.” Further, the order said that being transgender is “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued the new policy a month later, reversing former President Joe Biden’s order allowing service members to transition and serve openly under their preferred gender identity.Trump’s order immediately drew court challenges, including a separate case now in the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.A Department of Justice attorney arguing before the D.C. Circuit Tuesday alerted the judges that the administration would “imminently” appeal the 9th Circuit decision to the Supreme Court.Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Foundation, who are representing plaintiffs in the 9th Circuit case, released a statement in response Tuesday asserting, “Transgender service members have been openly serving our country with honor and distinction for almost a decade and have met and are meeting every neutral service-based standard.”“The U.S. Supreme Court should reject the invitation to stay the district court’s injunction so that they can impose their discriminatory ban while the litigation proceeds,” the statement said.The administration’s emergency application to the high court Thursday is just the latest in the administration’s whack-a-mole battle against lower federal court rulings that have blocked White House actions, particularly on immigration.",,,,2025-04-24 19:06:59.387921

The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.

Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units, and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With Utah facing a drier year, Gov. Spencer Cox issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in 17 counties due to drought conditions. 
The counties covered by the order include southern and rural areas of Washington, Iron, San Juan, Kane, Juab, Emery, Grand, Beaver, Garfield, Piute, Millard, Tooele, Uintah, Carbon, Sevier, Sanpete and Wayne counties. 
The governor’s executive order comes after the Drought Response Committee recently recommended he act due to drought conditions. 
“We’ve been monitoring drought conditions closely, and unfortunately, our streamflow forecasts are low, particularly in southern Utah,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “I urge all Utahns to be extremely mindful of their water use and find every possible way to conserve. Water conservation is critical for Utah’s future.”
Cox’s emergency declaration also comes after he told reporters last week he was working on issuing one due to worsening drought conditions in southern Utah, which has seen a weak snowpack this winter. 
Cox considers emergency declaration as drought worsens in southern Utah and Lake Powell levels drop

Though the governor said last week it’s been a “pretty normal year for most of the state,” there are some areas that are worse off than others. 
Currently, severe drought covers 42% of the state, and 4% is in extreme drought, according to the state’s website. 
This year, Utah’s snowpack peaked at 14.3 inches on March 23, which is equal to the state’s typical annual peak, according to state officials. However, southwestern Utah’s snowpack was only about 44% of normal. Plus, winter temperatures were 2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal. 
The state’s reservoir storage levels are at 84% of capacity, “which will help the state weather drought,” the governor’s office said in a news release. “However, drought is unpredictable, and taking proactive measures to prepare is critical.”
Cox’s order reflects the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s disaster classifications, which are informed by the U.S. Drought Monitor and NRCS’s water supply report.
“The state partners closely with federal agencies to share critical water supply and drought updates,” Joel Ferry, executive director for the Utah Department of Natural Resources, said in a  statement. “Proactive planning is essential. We ask all Utahns across all sectors to use less water to help stretch the water supply.”
It’s been almost exactly three years since the governor declared a drought declaration. The last time he did so was April 22, 2022, when 65% of the state was in extreme drought, and more than 99% of the state was experiencing at least severe drought conditions. 
As part of his order, Cox urged Utahns to watch their water use, both inside and outside their homes. 
Water-saving tips listed by SlowTheFlow.org include: 

Wait to water your lawn until temperatures are in the mid-70s for several consecutive days, and check the Weekly Lawn Watering Guide for other tips on how to optimize water use.
Fix leaks.
Run full loads for dishwashers and washing machines.
Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth, shaving, soaping up, doing dishes or rinsing vegetables.
Shorten your shower time by at least one minute.
Participate in water-saving programs like water-smart landscaping, toilet replacement, and smart sprinkler controllers.

(Canva image)Gov. Jeff Landry is backing a law change that would allow an appointed director of the Louisiana Racing Commission to continue owning racehorses, even though the director oversees their licensing as part of his government job. 
The proposed exception is included in House Bill 397, a sweeping piece of legislation that would also make dozens of changes to Louisiana’s ethics code for elected officials and public employees. 
Stephen Landry became the commission’s top staffer in 2024 after the governor appointed new members to its board. At the time, Stephen Landry, who is not related to the governor, had a partial ownership stake in two racehorses. 
Stephen Landry did not return a call made to his office Thursday. 
The commission is responsible for regulating horse racing and betting in Louisiana. It issues licenses to racetracks, training centers, off-track betting operations and racehorse owners like Stephen Landry. 
Commissioners can also suspend and withdraw racehorse owners’ licenses it previously granted.

The Louisiana Board of Ethics told Stephen Landry last year in an advisory opinion that state law is “silent” on whether he can own racehorses while serving as the commission’s executive director.  
State employees are prohibited from doing business with the agencies where they work, however. Using that logic, the ethics board told Stephen Landry he would not be able to apply for a racehorse owner’s license when he needs a renewal in 2026 if he still serves as the commission’s executive director. 
The change the governor is pushing would remove that barrier for Stephen Landry. 

Landry proactively sought the ethics board’s opinion about his horse ownership after the Paulick Report, a horse racing news outlet, raised concerns about him taking the commission director’s job.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

“How’s he supposed to investigate and recommend to his commissioners potential changes to the state’s breeders’ incentive program objectively?” editor-in-chief Natalie Voss wrote about Stephen Landry in a 2024 commentary. “What’s he going to do if he’s alerted [a co-owner of his horse] has a possible rule violation being investigated by the staff? How would he deal with an appeal of a disqualification coming from one of his active (or recent) ownership partners?” 

“The Association of Racing Commissioners International model rules expressly prohibit this, both for employees of a commission (like the executive director) or for employees under the executive director,” Voss added.
The racing commission’s chairman, Ed Koehl, told Stephen Landry when he took the executive director position that he could own horses without any fear of conflict, Stephen Landry’s attorney, Dane Ciolino, wrote in a letter to the ethics board. 
The commission, and not the executive director, votes on whether to grant or withdraw an ownership license, Ciolino said. 
Under a law approved last year, all 13 state racing commissioners who decide on ownership licensing can own racehorses that compete in Louisiana. Previously, only three of the 13 commissioners were allowed to own racehorses.

This year’s ethics bill, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R- New Iberia, reiterates that Louisiana Racing Commission members, in addition to the executive director, can own horses that race in Louisiana. 

Beaullieu’s proposal cleared its first legislative hurdle Wednesday when it passed the Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee. It’s goes next before the full House of Representatives.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Pet-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-24 19:06:59.387921

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)People interested in becoming a caregiver for older adults or people with disabilities in New Mexico will face more strict requirements under a new state law but now have a way of appealing if they get rejected.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on April 7 signed House Bill 131, which enhances background check requirements for caregivers, expanding the list of disqualifying criminal offenses.
At the same time, HB 131 creates an easier pathway for those who qualify for the job, which sponsors hope will help expand the workforce.
Starting July 1, anyone convicted of battery of a household member, animal cruelty, identity theft, human trafficking or assault of a peace officer can be found to pose an “unreasonable risk” as a caregiver. The new law also allows the Health Care Authority to write rules to add more crimes to the list.
The law already prohibited someone from becoming a caregiver if they had been convicted of homicide; drug trafficking; kidnapping; rape or other sexual offenses; abuse of adults or children; robbery; larceny; burglary; fraud; financial exploitation or embezzlement.
“This law reflects our commitment to protecting the safety and dignity of the New Mexicans who rely on caregiving services,” New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement. “By strengthening background checks, we are creating safer environments for vulnerable individuals and providing families with greater peace of mind.” 
Two of the bill’s co-sponsors in the Legislature told Source NM it is intended to decrease how long it takes to appeal a background check finding, and make the appeals process more effective, after providers gave feedback about it taking too long, which led to applicants giving up and working elsewhere like in the service industry.
Co-sponsor Rep. Elizabeth Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source NM that the bill will help people with disabilities because more people will be able to apply for jobs to care for them. She said there is very high staff turnover at groups homes, nursing homes and other care facilities, and it’s difficult to find replacements because caregiving is a demanding job that pays very little.
“These jobs have a lot of responsibility, I mean, this is someone’s mother, or grandmother or son that you’re taking care of,” Thomson said. “It can be a very stressful, very physically challenging job, and sometimes downright scary.”
For example, Thomson said she sees new staff working at the group home that houses her own son who is very tall, strong and has severe autism that can result in him engaging in difficult behaviors like smearing his own feces on the walls, ceilings and his own clothing.
Co-sponsor Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) told Source NM the bill fits into the legislative session’s broader focus on public safety by protecting the most vulnerable people, including those with disabilities.
Cates said the Health Care Authority’s Division of Health Improvement asked her to carry the bill. The division runs the state’s caregiver background check registry.
“These direct care providers are extraordinarily important in our community, especially now as our community is aging at a higher ratio, and we do not pay them a professional wage,” Cates said.
HB131 does not impact caregivers’ pay, but Cates and Thomson say they want to pursue future pieces of legislation to raise their compensation. In 2023, they co-sponsored a law that requires the state to conduct a cost study every two years for caregivers for people with developmental disabilities.
But as soon as the study’s findings are implemented, the pay rates are already two years behind inflation, Thomson said.
“Even before I started as a representative, I was an advocate for people with disabilities and even back then in the 1990s, we were saying, ‘You’re not paying these people enough,’” Thomson said. “I don’t know what the magic number is; I haven’t found it.”

At least 14 states have passed laws that restrict students’ use of smartphones in schools. Vermont lawmakers are debating whether to follow suit.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Should Vermont ban cellphones from schools?.","Student’s cell phones sit in baskets after they were turned in at the start of the school day in Rio de Janeiro, Wednesday, Feb. 5, on the first day of a national ban that restricts the use of smartphones in elementary and high schools. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)Ask almost any educator in the country and they’ll tell you: the phones are getting out of hand. “It’s a topic of interest just about anywhere,” Mike McRaith, associate executive director of the Vermont Principals Association, told members of the House Committee on Education last week. “Generally speaking, there’s a more universal understanding that there’s a real risk with digital addiction.” Growing concerns about the emotional and cognitive impacts of chronic smartphone and social media use among children have led to a nationwide movement to ban personal devices in classrooms. Already 14 states have implemented some form of a smartphone ban in schools, with eight more recommending that school boards adopt a policy. The legislatures of 23 other states, including Vermont, are actively weighing whether to follow suit. Also, many countries have put in place different versions of a nationwide school cellphone ban, including in Europe, and, recently, Brazil.In Montpelier, lawmakers are considering H.54, a bill that would require school districts and independent schools to develop and adopt policies prohibiting students from using personal electronic devices, including cellphones and smartwatches, during the school day (the legislation includes exceptions for students who need certain accommodations). As introduced, the bill would also ban schools from using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to communicate with students, aiming to discourage the integration of social media into education at all.“I’m in full favor of a bell-to-bell ban,” Rep. Casey Toof, R-St. Albans Town, told fellow committee members Thursday. “I think this is something that’s really important.”The bill doesn’t dictate how schools would implement the prohibition. Some Vermont schools like Harwood Union Middle and High School have already adopted policies requiring students to place their phones in lockable pouches each morning. But advocates of the bill have also pointed to more cost effective methods for collecting and storing smartphones, like using manila folders or bins.“I’m very mindful of the burden of the expense of storage, and that concerns me to some degree,” Rep. Emily Long, D-Newfane, told committee members Thursday.Although the bill has broad support in the House, its immediate future is uncertain. House lawmakers have considered tacking a phone-ban onto other pieces of related legislation this year, like the Kids Code, a bill that would require social media platforms to adjust their design codes for users under 18. Legislators could also continue working on the bill until next year. In a written statement to VTDigger, Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, chair of the House Education Committee, said the panel was still mulling over its options and considering what the “Senate’s appetite” to pass the legislation this year in any form would be. — Habib SabetIn the knowThe president of the state employees union accused the Vermont Department for Children and Families of retaliating against her after she spoke out about a new return-to-office policy — retribution that, she said, included secretly filming her during a remote staff meeting.Aimee Bertrand, the president of the Vermont State Employees Association and an employee of the department’s Economic Services Division, raised the allegations Thursday morning during a meeting of the House Committee on Human Services. “I’ve been a union activist for over 20 years,” Bertrand said in sometimes tearful testimony. “I have suspected being watched, but I have never concretely seen it.”Read more about the testimony here. — Peter D’AuriaTwo months ago, leaders from an Abenaki nation based in Quebec urged Vermont lawmakers at a panel in the Statehouse to reconsider a contentious past decision: granting state tribal recognition to four groups based throughout the state. On Wednesday, leaders of those four groups — the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki, Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation and the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi — appealed to legislators at an event at the Capitol, too, and struck a defiant tone.“We know who we are,” said Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan group, during the evening panel. “We will never stop being who we are — regardless of what people do.”Wednesday’s event brought out about 100 people and took place in the same meeting room in the Statehouse as the panel in February. Among the crowd were members and supporters of the state-recognized groups and at least 15 House or Senate members. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, the state’s second-highest-ranking official, also attended.Stevens and the other state-recognized tribal leaders urged lawmakers to reject the recent push by Odanak First Nation, the Abenaki tribe centered in Quebec, to revisit the state recognition process, which lawmakers created in 2010. They urged legislators instead to spend time advocating for their own communities’ needs and interests. Read more about the latest event here.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveJonah Richard wants to build a new neighborhood in Bradford, an Orange County town of about 2,800. Richard envisions 15 small “starter home” cottages tucked off the town’s main drag.

With CHIP, it does,” said Richard, founder of the Upper Valley-based developer Village Ventures.If the proposed program can bring in half a million dollars to help cover infrastructure costs – about 10-15% of the project’s total estimated price tag, Richard said – it could make the neighborhood, currently in its pre-development stage, pencil out.Read more about the ideas behind the proposed program here.— Carly BerlinVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Corrections sectionThe Green Mountain Care Board clarified Thursday that the $200 million in health care savings needed to keep health insurance premiums around 5% applies only to plans from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, not all insurers.

LINCOLN — A bill to reduce contributions to a state teachers retirement plan advanced toward final passage on Thursday despite a stern warning from a former Nebraska lawmaker who once guided state retirement plan policies.
The measure, Legislative Bill 645, is designed to help close the state’s projected $457 million budget deficit over two years by reducing the state’s contributions into teacher retirement plans by about $77 million, thus freeing up that money to help close the budget gap.
Former State Sen. Mark Kolterman, who headed the Legislature’s Retirement Systems Committee for seven years, said that using retirement plan funds to balance the budget doesn’t make financial sense, particularly when it’s uncertain if investments will garner enough revenue to maintain retirement funds.
“You don’t make reductions in contributions when the economy is moving in the wrong direction,” Kolterman said, noting the recent stock “market tumble.”


Turmoil at state retirement systems?
A member of the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems Board resigned earlier this week after Gov. Jim Pillen rejected the “best candidate” to head the agency that oversees state and school retirement plans.
Allen Simpson of Lincoln, a long-time PERB member, had headed the board’s personnel committee, which had recommended the hiring of the current interim director/deputy director of the agency, Tyler Cummings, to fill the vacancy left when former State Treasurer and State Sen. John Murante resigned in December.
“They’re not going to get a better candidate than Tyler Cummings,” said Simpson on Thursday.
Simpson said he resigned from the board on Monday feeling that if the governor did not agree with his committees’ pick, “you probably shouldn’t stay on.”
“I’m trying to say this in the most politically correct way possible,” said Simpson, who, like Pillen, is a Republican.
Pillen’s office did not respond immediately to a request for comment Thursday afternoon.
The search for a new director reportedly has been reopened. The job paid $205,000-a-year.
On Thursday, State Sen. Danielle Conrad said that the “uncertainty” with the director’s job and the vacancy on the PERB board has made it more difficult to decide the best policies when it comes to state retirement plans.


Letter outlines objections
Advocates of LB 645, including Lincoln Sen. Beau Ballard, the current chair of the Retirement Committee, dismissed the concern, maintaining that the state can safely lower its contributions to the school retirement plan because that plan is currently nearly 100% funded, and is taking in more contributions — from teachers, local school districts and the state — than needed.
Ballard has called the bill a “win” for the state budget and for teachers, because they will see about $1,000 a year in additional take-home pay by reducing their contributions via the proposal.

Kolterman commented after the state lawmakers, on a voice vote, advanced LB 645 to the final stage of debate. Prior to Thursday’s debate on the bill, the former senator sent a letter — obtained by the Nebraska Examiner — to the members of the Retirement Committee outlining his objections.
In the letter, Kolterman said that major changes in the state’s retirement plan contributions are usually not made so hastily, because if a pension plan becomes underfunded, the state has to make up the difference.
“Any changes to retirement benefits in any of the retirement plans must be approached with great caution, study, and examination of the actuarially calculated costs,” he wrote. LB 645, he said, was “kicking the can down the road” and delivering higher costs for taxpayers later.
Kolterman pointed out that during the 2008-09 recession, the state’s retirements plans lost 28% of its assets — about $2 billion — and that it took years of work to make them healthy again.
He cautioned in his letter that Nebraska doesn’t want to find itself in the same situation again —  forced to increase funds toward pension plans. It doesn’t make sense, he argued, to mess with what’s working.
‘Rule of 85’ 
Despite that, and despite similar warnings during floor debate on Thursday from Lincoln Sen. Danielle Conrad, the bill advanced to final reading.
Ballard said that he was “reassured” that LB 645 would not require additional state funds. He quoted from a  projection that even with a 0% increase in state investment income, no additional state contribution would be needed.
On Thursday, he withdrew his amendment that would have changed the state’s long standing “Rule of 85” for teachers that now allows educators, of at least 60 years of age, to retire if they have at least 25 years of service, which adds up to 85. Ballard’s amendment would have allowed younger teachers, of at least 55 years of age, to retire with 30 years of service.
  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025 (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Education groups, during a public hearing on that amendment on Wednesday, had opposed the idea out of concern that its impact — which some feared would increase retirement fund payouts — had not been studied.
Conrad also withdrew a proposed amendment to ensure that the state would not be liable for covering any financial shortages in the Omaha Public Schools retirement plan, a plan that the state recently took over to manage.
The senator said it was a “belt and suspenders” amendment to continue the state’s current policy of not being liable for shortages in that plan. She agreed to let fellow senators have more time to consider her proposal, and that she will reintroduce it during final round debate on LB 645.

,Mississippi Today,2025-04-24 22:21:23+00:00,Mississippi Today,Parents and providers urge state to use unspent TANF grants for child care,Simeon Gates,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/24/parents-providers-urge-use-of-unspent-tanf-grants-for-child-care/,Advocates say thousands of Mississippi children might lose child care as state puts hold on assistance program.,"Child care providers, parents, children, legislators and advocates gathered  outside the state Capitol Thursday to call on Mississippi to use unspent welfare funds and resume accepting child care certificate applications.
Last month, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced it will temporarily stop accepting new applications, redetermination applications and “add a child” applications for the child care certificate program for certain families as the result of the loss of COVID-19 relief funds. The hold, started March 31, will continue indefinitely. The program provides child care vouchers to eligible families, often with a co-payment fee.
MDHS explained that without the COVID-19 relief funding the number of families with child care certificates is more than it can support long term. When asked how long the hold would last, chief communications director Mark Jones explained the hold would end when the number of children with certificates dropped below 27,000 children and $12 million in monthly costs.
The week before the hold began, on March 28, 36,186 children had child care certificates. 25,300 of them fit into one of the MDHS’s priority categories. 10,800 did not.
The Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, Child Care Directors Network Alliance, Mississippi Delta Licensed Child Care Providers, and Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable organized Thursday’s gathering and  press conference to implore MDHS to tap into unused TANF funds to book the child care payment program.

“DHS has about $156 million in money from prior grant years that has gone unspent,” said Carol Burnett, MLICCI’s executive director, at the press conference.
The child care payment program gets funding from federal and state sources. It received $127 million from the Child Care Development Fund in fiscal year 2024, as well as $7 million in state appropriations, and $25.9 million transferred from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grant. 
That $25.9 million is 30% of the state’s annual TANF grant money transferred into funds for child care certificates. It is the maximum amount they’re allowed to transfer under federal law. The state also spends 85% of its money from the child care development fund on certificates, when federal law requires them to use at least 70%. 
MLICCI and others want MDHS to add to that by spending current and carryover TANF funds on child care subsidies for families that qualify for child care certificates. According to a memo MLICCI prepared, this method does not require legislative action, has no  spending limit, and is already used by other states.
Under the current hold, families can apply and get their certificates renewed if they fall in one of the following six categories: on Temporary Assistance for Needy FamiliesTANF or transitioning off of TANF, homeless, with foster children, teen parents, deployed military, orand with special needs. The Division of Early Childhood Care & Development will continue paying for certificates for all families until their certificates expire. 
In a statement, MDHS’ chief communications officer Mark Jones said “MDHS understands these concerns and reaffirms its commitment to support child care, transportation, education, and other needs of families who need to return or remain in the workforce. Our aim is to ensure our approaches are sustainable.”
Burnett, parent KyAsia Johnson, state Rep. Zakiya Summers, D-Jackson, and multiple child care providers talked about the toll the hold has taken on child care centers and families. They also stated the importance of child care to sustain the state’s workforce, keep child care providers afloat, and educate young children. 
They also urged citizens to contact the state’s political leadership to get their attention.
“This decision is putting people like me in an impossible situation,” said Johnson, a child care provider and parent. “What am I supposed to do without child care?”
Each provider spoke about how they had to explain the hold to parents, many of whom have had to pull their children out of day care. Cantrell Keyes, director of Agape Christian Academy World in Jackson, had five families pull their children out of her center. “More than half of my school tuition comes from CCPP,” she said.

Rep. Summers called on MDHS to lift the hold on child care applications, use the extra TANF funds, and communicate better with parents and providers. 
“Right now, thousands of Mississippi children might lose child care, not because the need has disappeared, but because the agency has made a choice,” she said.
The hold on child care certificates comes at a time when many child care providers and parents are struggling to stay afloat amid high costs, high turnover and high demand.

Some people waited over two hours to testify. (Screencap/CapitolTV) Some people waited two hours to speak at Tuesday night’s meeting of the Rhode Island House Committee on Municipal Government and Housing. Some people couldn’t wait and left before they had their chance. 
Rep. Stephen Casey, the Woonsocket Democrat and committee chair, shuffled the six sign-up sheets in his hands, each page filled with the names of Providence residents who wanted to testify at a hearing on a bill that would raise the the city’s levy, or total collected tax revenue, above the statewide 4% cap in fiscal year 2026. The hearing room and overflow area were packed with about 100 people.
As the meeting stretched past 7 p.m., Casey opted for speed over procedure, and told people to leave the microphones on when they came up to testify. 
Smiley puts faith in General Assembly in unveiling $624.1M fiscal 2026 budget

“Don’t anybody touch anything. Just get up there and talk,” he said.
Providence residents had a lot to say about the bill sponsored by Rep. Rebecca Kislak, and three other Democratic reps in the city: Scott Slater, Edith Ajello and Nathan Biah. The bill’s 27-word amendment to the state’s municipal tax law would authorize the capital city to hike its levy on owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential properties, commercial properties, tangible properties, and natural growth, or the increase in value of properties over time.
Kislak’s bill would allow Providence to go up to 8% more than last year. Mayor Brett Smiley is proposing a 7.5% increase, announced April 16 in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget.
The impact would hit property owners depending on the kind of home they own and if they live there. The average tax bill for owners who live in their single-family homes or condominium units would go up 4%. But the increase would be 16% for homes with two to five families, whether owner-occupied or not.
“We think that this is, in fact, an extraordinary ask,” Smiley told lawmakers. “But it’s because there are extraordinary circumstances. The last time the city of Providence was at the State House to ask for this was over 15 years ago during the 2008 financial crisis.”
The budgeting maneuver is meant to cushion city finances for fiscal year 2026 against an expensive settlement with the state education department to resolve past underfunding of Providence public schools. But compliance with that November 2024 settlement, which accounts for $11 million in the upcoming fiscal year’s budget and additional investments in subsequent fiscal years, depends on state lawmakers’ approval.
“There are a lot of reasons that Providence has this need to increase the levy,” Kislak said in her introduction of the bill, citing the agreement with the Rhode Island Department of Education as “the most immediate.” 
“We will be fixing…30 years of underfunding of our schools in just three years,” Kislak said. “We should do it. It’s painful, and it’s so important to the city.” 
No Plan B
Without the General Assembly’s approval, Smiley has said his budget will need to return to the Providence City Council and substantial revisions made. The council is still engaged in the budgeting process with a final version emerging in June. Ahead of Kislak’s April 2 introduction of the bill, the council voted to affirm up to an 8% increase. 
Democratic Rep. David Morales of Providence — a 26-year-old lawmaker who’s floated the idea of running for mayor himself one day — wondered why no Plan B was in place.
“Has your administration prepared an alternative budget in the case that the committee does not move forward with this levy proposal?” Morales asked Smiley. 
“No, we have not,” the mayor replied. 










We will be fixing…30 years of underfunding of our schools in just three years. We should do it. It’s painful, and it’s so important to the city. 


– Rep. Rebecca Kislak, a Providence Democrat and sponsor of the bill authorizing the capital city to exceed state tax levy cap


Morales also asked Smiley if he would stay for the entirety of the hearing, “because we have dozens of working people across the city of Providence that are here to share their perspective,” Morales said.
Smiley replied: “I appreciate that. I’ll stay as long as I can.”
In a phone interview Thursday, Morales said Smiley left before residents had their turn to testify but encountered residents outside the committee hearing room. A WPRI-12 report on Tuesday confirmed that Smiley spent time talking to residents for some time in the State House rotunda, explaining his budget in detail.
“Mayor (and also in a different spot I) stayed for hours talking to people in the hallway,” Kislak said via text message Wednesday. “We should pass this bill plus additional revenue bills that will give the city council and mayor additional flexibility in their budget negotiations.”
Some of the additional revenue bills Kislak previously mentioned include taxes on parking lots and Airbnbs.
Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for the mayor, said in a statement Wednesday, “Mayor Smiley has been attending community meetings in every ward of Providence collecting feedback from neighbors and explaining the critical importance of this legislation and he was glad to have stayed at the State House last night to answer every question community members had.”
Morales was disappointed in Smiley’s showing before the committee, he said. “I think he was dismissive…He opted to talk about the complex formula as to how one’s property taxes are calculated, which I think was an easy cop-out from actually answering any questions.”
A threatened ‘speck of green’
Many people testifying Tuesday were addressing lawmakers for the first time, Morales said, and some spoke through Spanish interpreters. Residents worried about tax hikes being passed to renters, making apartments unaffordable and ultimately leading to displacement. 
Charles Pinning, a landlord and part-time writing professor at the University of Rhode Island, explained how the levy hike would affect his tenants: “These people who have spoken, ‘Oh, yeah, when I rent the apartment, I will pass it on to them.’ They’re absolutely correct.”
Providence residents viewed the committee as an important blockade against the tax hike’s passage, arguing that the City Council will likely approve the measure. But the House committee emphasized its role is to merely allow the levy hike to happen. The venue for resisting the hike itself, they suggested, was at City Council hearings instead.
Casey, the chair, at times told public testimonies to stay on track, and not stray into discussions of the city’s housing market or general critiques of Smiley. He told one man his testimony’s content was better suited to a Facebook post. 
“This bill has been held for further study,” Casey said. “Everybody needs to relax. We’re not going to vote on it today.”
Fixed-income homeowners, including senior citizens, said a 25% additional property tax exemption for senior citizens under Smiley’s budget was insufficient. Sandra Lee, a low-income senior citizen and 25-year resident of the Mount Hope neighborhood, said her property assessment went up 100% in the most recent valuation, and her lot 521%. 
“I own a little home there, and I own a little speck of green,” Lee said. “My right to quiet enjoyment is being threatened, and I don’t know what to do. I feel completely powerless.”
City councilors host community meetings
The bill was held for further study, as is standard practice on an initial hearing. Based on conversations with his colleagues before and after Tuesday’s hearing, Morales thinks the committee vote will not be unanimous.
Morales said Thursday he was proud of the people in his city who showed up to be heard, and hoped his fellow committee members were listening closely.
“I hope that they recognize that these stories of hardships are going to become reality if we’re not conscientious about our own decisions when we vote on this,” Morales said.

At the hearing, Rep. José Batstia of Providence told fellow Democrat Smiley that he understands how the city has been wedged between a multimillion dollar rock and the hard place of a tax increase. But he said he would not support the levy hike, because he thinks the city is not doing enough to extract money from the city’s wealthy nonprofits like Brown University.
Smiley, in part, agreed. Nearly half of the city’s property is tax-exempt, he said, adding the city is “burdened with a hugely disproportionate share of the tax-exempt properties in Rhode Island: the colleges, the hospitals, government, churches and certain nonprofits.”
“It is, I know, very popular, and certainly the size of their endowment makes it eye- popping. But it is not just Brown,” Smiley said.
Morales thinks the city has not explored all its options, citing industrial, waterfront properties on the city’s south side. “They can certainly afford to pay more in their taxes,” Morales said, an alternative to what he described as the overly broad taxation in Smiley’s strategy, in which “owner-occupied, multifamily homes…are going to feel the brunt of this increase.” 
Meanwhile the budgeting process chugs along on the city side. In an email Thursday, Marc Boyd, a City Council spokesperson, said individual councilors have been holding community meetings over the past month with residents in their respective wards to hear concerns about “revaluations, property taxes, the levy overall, and the budget process broadly.” 
“Now that the mayor has proposed his budget, the Finance Committee will review, vet, and, if necessary, amend the mayor’s proposal as part of the normal budget process which, as usual, will include public hearings, the first of which is scheduled for May 6th,” Boyd said.
Boyd added that on Saturday, May 3, several Spanish-speaking councilors will be hosting a Latino Town Hall to discuss the same issues with Spanish-speaking residents. English translation will be available, and the event runs from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the Providence Career and Technical Academy on Fricker Street.

(Danielle Prokop / Source New Mexico)The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in Las Cruces is one of six national monuments Interior Department officials have identified to lose federal protections, two sources told the Washington Post in a story published Thursday. 
Those federal protections prevent private companies from exploiting the monuments for minerals, oil and gas or other commodities. In addition to the monument in Southern New Mexico, the Post names ones in Utah, Arizona and California, including Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon, Ironwood Forest, Chuckwalla, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, on the list.
Being added to the list means Interior Department officials are reviewing geological maps to analyze the potential for mining and oil production and to assess whether to revise their boundaries, one person told the Washington Post, which provided the person anonymity to discuss decisions that had not yet been made.
Members of the state’s congressional delegation also named Organ Mountains Desert Peaks as one of three national monuments in the state — along with Rio Grande del Norte and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks — potentially on the chopping block in a letter earlier this week to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, which urged him to maintain protections.
NM delegation: Three national monuments could be reduced, eliminated

Patrick Nolan, executive director of the Friends of Desert Mountains-Organ Peaks organization, told Source New Mexico that the Thursday report represents the clearest sign yet that the “extremely popular” monument could lose its protections.
“These rumors have been percolating for a few months, and I think this is the most tangible, real thing that we have seen,” he said in a phone interview. “Right now, I have to assume that it’s real.”
Heinrich, in a post on social media, criticized the Interior Department for the prospect of selling off public lands to the highest bidder. 
“Stripping Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks of its protections would be a reckless abuse of power and a slap in the face to countless New Mexicans. We have a moral responsibility to future generations that supersedes any ultra wealthy executive’s desire to line their pockets,” he wrote. 
The report coincides with a leak of a draft strategy document at Interior first reported on by news organization Public Domain. The strategy document, which Source NM also obtained, lays out the messaging and objectives the department intends to use as it explores things like “releas[ing] federal holdings to allow state and local communities to reduce costs” and “increas[ing] revenues from grazing, timber, critical minerals, gravel and other non-energy resources.” 
Nolan noted that Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks is a relatively new national monument, first granted federal protection in 2014 under President  Barack Obama. During President Donald Trump’s first term, his administration reviewed it and other Southwest monuments to potentially strip their federal protections. 
In that period, Nolan said, no mining or other private interest clamored to extract resources from the land now protected.
“It makes it more confusing,” he said. “Because there is no known, at least to me and the general public, presence of these materials. So it really calls into question, what is the real intention behind these reviews and boundary redrawing?”
Nolan’s best guess? “They don’t like protected public lands,” he said. 
In the decade since becoming a national monument, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks has become wildly popular and a major economic driver in the region, Nolan said. Businesses like Organ Mountain Outfitters have popped up, and it’s become a national destination for bicycle backpacking, he said. 
According to a study commission by the Las Cruces Green Chamber published last year, the designation of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks has resulted in a $234 million economic impact over the last decade. Visitation to the area increased from 183,900 in 2012, which was before it became a national monument, to 612,781 in 2022, according to the report. 
The news of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks moving closer to losing its protected status drew rebukes across New Mexico’s conservation interest groups. New Mexico Wild is one of them.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe president of the state employees union accused the Vermont Department for Children and Families of retaliating against her after she spoke out about a new return-to-office policy — retribution that, she said, included secretly filming her during a remote staff meeting.Aimee Bertrand, the president of the Vermont State Employees’ Association and an employee of the department’s Economic Services Division, raised the allegations Thursday morning during a meeting of the House Committee on Human Services. “I’ve been a union activist for over 20 years,” Bertrand said in sometimes tearful testimony. “I have suspected being watched, but I have never concretely seen it.”That is, until now, she said. The alleged recording took place amid union frustration over the department’s decision last fall to bring some division staffers back to the office after several years in which they had the option of working remotely. In late October, Bertrand had expressed disappointment about the fact that Commissioner Chris Winters had not addressed the new remote work policy in his weekly email update.“Your failure to recognize and respond to the fears and concerns of your workforce is disappointing,” Bertrand wrote in an emailed reply to that update — in which she copied the entirety of the department staff.In her telling, that started a campaign of retaliation from management. The department lowered her score in a performance evaluation and launched an audit of her use of personal medical leave — something Bertrand said she’d never heard of happening before.Bertrand said she filed an unfair labor practice charge over those actions in March. A week later, she said, she was told that she was under investigation for an alleged breach of confidentiality.READ MORE





 


Vermont department orders some workers back to the office

November 27, 2024, 6:51 amNovember 26, 2024, 4:35 pm 



That alleged breach occurred during an Economic Services Division all-staff meeting conducted on Microsoft Teams in November. During that meeting, staffers were required to have their cameras on, Bertrand told lawmakers, and the meetings were supposed to be confidential.Bertrand said she took the meeting sitting in her kitchen. While there, she said, her partner walked behind her, through the frame of her computer camera, to get a cup of coffee.During DCF’s investigation, she said, she was shown cellphone photos of a computer screen showing her on camera with her partner walking behind her. Later, she said, she viewed a 10-minute cellphone video from which those photos were drawn. That video was filmed by a DCF manager on their phone and focused on the video stream from Bertrand’s computer camera — essentially, a window into her kitchen.“It’s so so, so violating,” Bertrand said in an interview Thursday. “I am so creeped out by it.”Winters, the Department for Children and Families commissioner, said that he was unable to discuss Bertrand’s situation because it is a personnel matter.

SPRINGFIELD – Standing on his backyard deck Thursday – the same place where he declared his 1996 candidacy for U.S. Senate – Illinois’ senior Sen. Dick Durbin reflected on his decision to retire after four decades in Congress.

“I’ve done this my way, making decisions based on family needs and personal needs, and what I thought would serve our state well,” Durbin told reporters with a crowd of staff, family and friends listening in the background.

Durbin, a Springfield Democrat who was born in East St. Louis, announced Wednesday he will retire from the Senate when his term ends in 2027 following 44 years in Congress. He has been the No. 2 ranking Democrat in the Senate since taking over as caucus whip in 2005 and chaired the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee during the Biden administration.

Durbin, 80, would be 88 at the end of another term if he won in the 2026 election. Durbin said he still feels up to the job today, but that may not be the case by the time another term would end in 2033.

Durbin is one of six senators who are at least 80 years old. The age of the nation’s leaders became a key issue early in the 2024 presidential election after a poor debate performance by former President Joe Biden, who was 81 at the time. President Donald Trump is 78.

Durbin said he doesn’t believe age has ever gotten in the way of his job.

“I had to project forward,” Durbin said. “The campaign’s going to last two years, and then you’re going to serve six years. So are you ready to make an eight-year commitment? That’s the truth and reality of the United States Senate. I didn’t think at this point it was the right thing to do.”

There’s still more he wants to accomplish as a legislator, Durbin said, despite being in the minority party in Congress. He said Trump’s second administration made his decision more difficult.

“The madder I got about what Trump is doing to this country and to the Constitution, the more I wanted to serve and not step aside,” Durbin said.

Durbin didn’t express any regrets about the job, noting that on a personal level, he flew home from Washington, D.C., every weekend of his career. But in the legislature, Durbin has long sponsored the DREAM Act – an initiative to create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and could be subject to deportation. Durbin has unsuccessfully pushed the bill for more than 20 years.

“The first time I’d ever met Donald Trump, he had just been sworn in as president. I was at a luncheon and walked up to him and said, ‘I want to talk to you about the DREAM Act,’” Durbin recalled. “He said, ‘you don’t have to say another word. You’re talking about those young kids? I’ll take care of them.’”

The DREAM Act was a basis for DACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was established in 2012 under President Barack Obama. Trump tried to phase out the program during his first term. Durbin said that while he continues to push Congress to pass the DREAM Act, he doesn’t believe it will move forward during his final years with Trump at the helm.

Durbin’s retirement is expected to open the door for a dozen or more Illinois Democrats to throw their hat into a 2026 Democratic primary. Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, a Chicago Democrat, became the first person to launch a Senate campaign Thursday morning.

“I’m not planning on endorsing any particular candidate,” Durbin said. “I hope I don’t have to but I’m not ruling out the possibility in an extreme case. I just think it’s up to the voters, the Democratic voters, to make this choice moving forward.”

He acknowledged talking with Stratton and other candidates about running for office, chiefly that no one interested in running for Senate wanted to run against Durbin in a primary.

Durbin represents an old breed in Illinois politics of influential downstate Democrats. He succeeded his mentor, the late former Sen. Paul Simon, who was also a downstate Democrat. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Hoffman Estates in Cook County, will become the state’s senior senator in 2027.

The Democratic nominee for Durbin’s seat could be from the Chicago area. Durbin said the state’s next senator must represent the interests of the whole state.

“Work the entire state. Discover downstate if you don’t know it,” Durbin said. “Discover the suburbs, the surrounding counties and Cook County, the city of Chicago … that’s been one of the real blessings of this job.”

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House sent a bill to the governor Thursday that would allow hard roofs over boat docks, slips and lifts in Iowa. 
House File 710 advanced from the Senate floor Wednesday, with an amendment that swapped the term “enclosed structure” to “roof” in the bill. The House approved the amendment from senators. 
Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, said the legislation would “put Iowa’s boat dock regulations in line with the other 49 states,” which he said do not prohibit hard roofs on docks. 
Current law only allows roofs or siding of “soft-sided” materials over boat hoists. The issue has made regulation difficult on Carter Lake, which is in both Iowa and Nebraska.
Turek said he does not own a dock or a boat on Carter Lake, despite an allegation made the day prior on the Senate floor by Sen. Dave Sires, R-Cedar Falls, that the legislation was sponsored by a “House of Representative person who built an illegal dock on Carter Lake.” 
Sires opposed the bill, saying hard roofs would cause more damage to an area during flooding or high winds and allow gargantuan docks to be built.
The bill would require that docks with roofs be less than 30 feet wide, and no taller than 20 feet above the surface of the water. Dock owners would also be required to maintain dock liability insurance of at least $1 million per occurrence to be in compliance with the bill. 
Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, thanked the people of Carter Lake who he said were “very, very persistent” on the bill. 
HF 710 advanced unanimously from the House.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The superminority status of the Florida Democratic Party in the state Legislature just got smaller when Democratic Senate Leader Jason Pizzo stunningly announced that he was leaving the party and would become a political independent.
Democrats already had just 11 members in the 40-member chamber, after Orange County Sen. Geraldine Thompson died just weeks before this year’s legislative session began. They are now down to just 10 members.
“The Democratic Party in Florida is dead,” he said while speaking on the floor of the Senate following the conclusion of the chamber’s business for the day. “But there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
He went on to say that the Democratic Party that his father volunteered for when John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960 was not the same party today.
“It craves and screams anarchy and then demands amnesty, and that’s not okay,” he said. “I’ve always been criticized by the far left and the far right,  but you know what the small businesses and the hard-working families and the teachers and the cops and the firemen want us to do?  Be public servants, not politicians.”
A former assistant state’s attorney in Miami-Dade County, Pizzo has had a reputation as a centrist Democrat since his election to the Senate in 2018, and at times has angered the more liberal parts of the party, particularly regarding criminal justice issues.
He’s also one of the wealthiest members of the Legislature, with an estimated worth of $59 million, based on his 2023 financial disclosure forms.
Whether this will affect his putative plan to run for governor is uncertain at this point. He has previously said he was considering the possibility, although he said in January that he would not run as a political independent.
Some of the party’s top leaders reacted with anger to Pizzo’s announcement.
“Jason Pizzo is one of the most ineffective and unpopular Democratic leaders in recent memory, and his resignation is one of the best things to happen to the party in years,” said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried in a statement.
“His legacy as leader includes continually disparaging the party base, starting fights with other members, and chasing his own personal ambitions at the expense of Democratic values,” Fried continued.
“Jason’s failure to build support within our party for a gubernatorial run has led to this final embarrassing temper tantrum. I’d be lying if I said I’m sad to see him go, but I wish him the best of luck in the political wilderness he’s created for himself. The Florida Democratic Party is more united without him.”
Hillsborough Democrat Fentrice Driskell, the party’s leader in the House, similarly made blistering remarks about her now former Democratic colleague.
“The party needs strong Democrats who are ready to stand up to Trump, not big egos more interested in performative outrage than true leadership. Legislative Democrats will be fine without him,” she said in a statement. “The Democratic Party is not dead, but if it was Jason Pizzo should consider the fact that he has been a party leader and would bear some responsibility.”
Stunned
Pizzo’s Democratic Senate colleagues seemed stunned — and more charitable about Pizzo’s bombshell.
“It’s a surprise to us,” said South Florida Democratic Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“We need to process all this information,” added Palm Beach Sen. Lori Berman. “He is certainly independent and he did what he felt was right for himself, and like Sen. Jones said, I think he’s not going to become a far-right wing Republican by any means, and he will continue to be an effective voice here in the Florida Legislature and hopefully a voice of reason, as he has been.”
Pizzo is the third state Democratic lawmaker to leave the party in the past half-year. In December, Hillsborough County Rep. Susan Valdés switched to the GOP immediately after losing a bid to lead the Hillsborough County Democratic Party. Weeks later, Broward County Democrat Hillary Cassel did the same, saying the party no longer represented her values.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power responded in a statement that Pizzo could have waited until the end of the legislative session, “but it’s clear he could no longer tolerate the direction of the party.”
Power’s comment does lead into the question of why Pizzo chose Thursday, just eight days before the legislative session is scheduled to end, to make his announcement (although Senate President Ben Albritton announced earlier in the day that the session would go beyond next Friday due to an impasse regarding the state budget).
Earlier in the day, former Florida GOP Congressman David Jolly announced that he was switching from being a non-party-affiliated voter and was now a registered Democrat, fueling speculation that he in fact will run for the party’s nomination for governor in 2026.

A federal grand jury indicted Nasir Ullah, 28, and Naim Ullah, 32, both of Sumter, as well as Puquan Huang, 49, of Burford, Georgia, acting U.S. Attorney Brook Andrews announced Thursday. Each faces a charge of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
  Nasir Ullah, 28, of Sumter (Mugshot provided by Sumter County Sheriff’s Department)
Lawyers for the men did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
The men stand accused of laundering more than $30 million in illegal drug proceeds, taking cash from known drug sales associated with two major Mexican cartels and using it to purchase and ship electronics to Hong Kong, China and the United Arab Emirates to be sold for a profit.
“Money laundering is the backbone of criminal enterprise,” Andrews said. “It enables drug trafficking organizations to purchase and distribute fentanyl and other drugs to devastating effect. When we target those who launder drug money, we strike at the very heart of these operations.”
Law enforcement alleges the men collected money from various locations in York, Richland, Sumter and Charleston counties, as well as from other states across the Southeast. They stored the cash at a pair of business properties in Sumter.
  Naim Ullah, 32, of Sumter (Mugshot provided by Sumter County Sheriff’s Department)
Police and federal agents raided those businesses in late January, as well as two homes, arresting Nasir Ullah, Naim Ullah and one other man in Sumter, multiple television news stations reported.
They seized an estimated $230,000 in cash, three vehicles, 11 guns and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in the raids.
Court documents also reference hundreds of millions of dollars seized during multiple traffic stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina between July 2021 and November 2024.
Police traced the money to the sale of fentanyl, cocaine, marijuana and heroin.
Two milligrams of fentanyl, which is roughly the size of the tip of a sharpened pencil, is a lethal dose, said Mike Tooley, an assistant special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.
By comparison, just one of the seizures involving $177,000 of cash would be enough to purchase seven kilograms of powdered fentanyl. That amount of fentanyl could kill 3.5 million people, or more than half the population of South Carolina.

In an acceptance speech, Bedenbaugh thanked his colleagues and the students he teaches, saying they impart as much wisdom to him as he does to them.
“To every student out there, you are the reason we do this,” Bedenbaugh said. “Your dreams, your resilience and your light fuel our purpose.”
Bedenbaugh initially wanted to become a lawyer, but the prelaw classes he took during his first year at Newberry College didn’t inspire him, he said. At the urging of his college advisor, Bedenbaugh enrolled in education classes with the aim of becoming a history teacher.
Those classes “allowed me to see the true impact (my teachers) had left in me, an impact that I had not really seen prior to thinking about it,” Bedenbaugh said.
Along with teaching, Bedenbaugh founded “Bow Ties with Bedenbaugh,” a mentorship program meant to teach young men life skills. He also coaches a girls’ basketball team and sponsors the school’s student council and Fellowship of Christian Athletes, according to the state Department of Education.
“Corey Bedenbaugh is an outstanding educator who goes above and beyond to inspire his students every day,” his district superintendent, Ashley Atkinson, said in a statement.
Each school district in the state selects its own teacher of the year, which the Department of Education narrows down to five finalists. Each receives $10,000.
On top of an additional $15,000 from the state, Bedenbaugh received $2,000 from the Bojangles Foundation Fund, a BMW to drive for the coming year and the ability to take classes tuition-free toward a graduate degree from the University of South Carolina.
“This award is an honor and acknowledgement, but the real reward is the privilege of teaching,” said Bedenbaugh, who already holds a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction from the University of Phoenix.
The award also comes with extra responsibility. Bedenbaugh will spend the next year mentoring other teachers, working with high-achieving high school students who want to join the profession and leading an annual conference for educators.
While the award goes to one teacher, it’s meant to highlight the work of educators as a whole in helping the next generation of students grow, Weaver said.
“We’re honoring all of those whose lasting influence stays long after classroom lights go out, those who are writing South Carolina’s next chapter, one student, one lesson plan, one incredible breakthrough at a time,” Weaver said.
Legislators in recent years have taken steps toward hiking teachers’ pay and improving their working conditions.
Since 2017, the state-funded minimum salary for first-year teachers has risen from $30,100 to $47,000, with legislators set to provide an additional $1,500 boost for the coming school year. That will bring the minimum pay for a teacher with 12 years of experience and a master’s degree — what’s loosely considered an average — to $58,750.
Gov. Henry McMaster noted that more funding has also provided more mental health professionals and law enforcement officers in schools.
All of that has been to help the state’s teachers, said the governor, who fondly recalled the teachers who have shaped his own life.
“Ladies and gentlemen, if someone doesn’t teach it to you, you’re not going to know it,” McMaster said.
Bedenbaugh called on everyone in the audience to continue supporting educators.
“Together, let’s continue to champion the power of education, because when we invest in our children, we invest in the future of our great state,” Bedenbaugh said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-24-at-5.10.57-PM-1024x546.png,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

California receives $2.4 billion in federal Title I money for low-income schools, about $1.3 billion for special education and $250 million for after-school programs, among other grants. 


California K-12 schools got a reprieve today when a judge blocked President Donald Trump’s order to eliminate diversity programs or risk losing federal funding.
New Hampshire Judge Landya McCafferty said Trump’s order didn’t sufficiently define diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, limited free speech and went beyond his authority. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the ruling, but for now it means that the federal government must continue to fund special education, after-school programs, services for low-income students and other federal programs.

Advice to California schools on Trump’s DEI crackdown: Do nothing — yet 

by Carolyn Jones 





The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union. They alleged that Trump’s DEI order was overly vague and would cause undue harm to students. California had responded to the order by saying its schools were already in compliance with civil rights laws.
California joined about a dozen states in pushing back against the order. Separately, the Trump administration said it would withhold federal K-12 money to Maine over its protections for transgender students, and is investigating California over the same issue.
McCafferty’s ruling only applied to schools that have at least one staff person who belongs to the National Education Association, which is nearly all schools in California.
Politics and Title I
California receives $2.4 billion in federal Title I money for low-income schools, about $1.3 billion for special education, $250 million for after-school programs, and millions more in grants for career education, school meals and other programs.
The Trump administration said they didn’t intend to cut special education funding, but Title I and other programs were potentially at risk. In the current wobbly economic climate, it’s doubtful that the state would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and those programs would almost certainly face steep cuts if not total elimination.
Trump is not the first president to threaten to withhold Title I funds, the largest piece of federal K-12 money. Not long after Congress created Title I in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson threatened to withhold it from schools in the South that refused to desegregate.
Other presidents have occasionally threatened to withhold federal funds to schools, although none have actually done it, said Sarah Reber, a senior fellow in economics policy at the Brookings Institution.
“It’s not unusual to have Title I get caught up in controversies, but it’s never over the value of Title I itself,” Reber said. “It’s usually over a broader political issue.”
Nearly every district in California gets some Title I funding, which schools use to hire tutors and aides, reduce class sizes, and purchase books and other materials. The government requires that schools use the money to help low-income students, who typically don’t perform as well academically as their peers.
The money goes from the federal government to the state to school districts, which distribute it to schools that have a certain percentage of low-income students. The amount of money has mostly been stable year to year, although during the pandemic the government gave schools billions more money in COVID relief grants based on the Title I formula. 
Losing Title I money now would be especially difficult for schools as their emergency pandemic grants are expiring and states are experiencing budget uncertainties, Reber said.
After-school and summer programs
Another significant portion of federal K-12 funding is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which funds after-school and summer programs. In California, the money supplements the state’s contributions to those programs and is the only source of funding for high school after-school programs, such as student government or homework help.
“Without 21st Century grants, those programs would be wiped out,” said Heather Williams, director of policy and outreach for the California AfterSchool Network. 
Until 2006, federal funding was the primary source of support for after-school programs, and offerings were scant. But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gov. Gavin Newsom both championed the potential for after-school programming as a safe place where children could get healthy snacks, tutoring and a gamut of enrichment activities. During the pandemic, California created the Expanded Learning Opportunities Programming, which last year distributed $4 billion to elementary schools.
Although after-school programs have garnered bipartisan support, Williams is wary of the current administration. During Trump’s first term, he tried to cut 21st Century grants all four years, but was thwarted by Congress.
“We’ve known for a long time that after school programs are important,” Williams said. “But right now it seems people are caught up in a broader political argument that overlooks the value of actual programs.”

As bill sponsors in the Michigan House Government Operations Committee argued Thursday that sanctuary statuses threaten public safety and social welfare and housing funds should go towards only legal citizens, immigration stakeholders argued the proposals are dehumanizing and destructive.
All of the bills presented Thursday cleared the Republican-controlled committee without support from the two Democratic members, though the bills would not likely gain enough support in the Democratic-led state Senate to make it to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, also a Democrat, to be signed into law.
Bills the committee heard testimony for, House Bills 4338 and 4339, would ban local governments and counties from creating or enforcing sanctuary city or county policies, ordinances or laws. Municipalities with existing sanctuary city policies would have 60 days after the bill goes into effect to remove the policy.
Additionally, Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton) is sponsoring House Bill 4342 to penalize any municipality that doesn’t cut its sanctuary policies by withholding state revenue sharing dollars, which fund local police and fire departments, as well as road repairs and sewage systems.
“My goal in speaking here today is to stress how reckless sanctuary policies are and how they shield criminals and put them before Michigan residents who want to raise their families in safe communities,” DeSana said. “Communities that choose to ignore our federal immigration laws are putting lives at risk and it’s time we hold them accountable.”
Official sanctuary cities are nearly non-existent in Michigan, with some cities like Lansing operating as unofficial sanctuary municipalities, instructing law enforcement not to inquire about a person’s immigration status unless necessary. Some municipalities like Detroit and Bay City have adopted “welcoming” statuses to welcome individuals of all immigration statuses.
Amongst the organizations that wrote in their opposition to the bills was the Michigan Sheriffs’ Association.
With the strains that are already on public safety agencies, Yvonne Navarrete, policy director for We the People Michigan, said the last thing they should be prioritizing is dedicating any time or resources to complying or helping federal immigration officials. And with individuals already being detained and deported without due process under President Donald Trump’s administration, further opening the door to federal agents will only further weaken the systems of justice in the U.S., Navarrette said.
“I’m begging for competence…You can’t even define what a sanctuary policy is,” Navarrete said. “All I’m asking is that if you are so bold enough to take my public tax dollars and be a policy maker, at least be competent and write coherent policies that are efficient, that don’t waste our public tax dollars and actually do the thing you want them to do.”
Other bills the committee considered were House Bills 4340 and 4341, which would amend Michigan’s Social Welfare Act and State Housing Development Authority Act to prohibit non U.S. citizens from receiving services or grants provided under those acts. 
Downriver Reps. Rylee Linting (R-Grosse Ile) and Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown), who are sponsoring the bills, asserted that these policies would allow limited state services to go to “lawful citizens” who are struggling.
There is a lot of suffering in Michigan, Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming) said, from food insecurity, homelessness and in general, barriers to family prosperity. However, the bills before the committee appear to leave the most vulnerable individuals in the state left out of life-saving services, Fitzgerald said, asking if noncitizens who are survivors of domestic violence or children who have experienced violence would still be allowed access.
“They would absolutely be eligible for services if they are legal Americans, if they came here legally,” Thompson said, offering her concern for the people in her district that can’t find affordable housing amidst Michigan’s housing crisis.
“It is important that we prioritize those who are here legally and are actually American citizens before we move on to anything else,” Linting said. “These bills are showing compassion to… the veterans living on the streets who served our country, families that are struggling, and ultimately, it is a slap in the face to immigrants who have come here legally, waited in line and now they are struggling and need help, for us to put someone here illegally, to put them ahead of them.”
There’s a presumption that Michigan’s noncitizen community doesn’t contribute to the state’s economy, Lisa Hile of the Rural Caucus of the Michigan Democratic Party said. But immigrants are the backbone of Michigan’s agricultural industry, a top industry in the state, Hile said, and beyond that, they are valued members of communities all over Michigan.
“They’re not taking anything from you,” Hile said. “You’re turning people on each other for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I’m tired. You’re… trying to get people to believe there’s problems that’s not here.”
A 2024 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that undocumented immigrants in Michigan contributed more than $290 million in state and local taxes in 2022.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_24-04-2025-17-00-46-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

Developers are cheering the so-called CHIP program, which would finance infrastructure to support development, including in towns that weren’t able to take advantage of similar options in the past. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed infrastructure financing program would allow even small Vermont towns to incentivize housing.","This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.Jonah Richard wants to build a new neighborhood in Bradford, an Orange County town of about 2,800. Richard envisions 15 small “starter home” cottages tucked off the town’s main drag. His hope is to sell them at a price point that has become vanishingly rare in Vermont: under $300,000.But it would only work, he says, with water and sewer system financing from an initiative under consideration at the Statehouse – the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP.“Without CHIP, this project doesn’t move forward. With CHIP, it does,” said Richard, founder of the Upper Valley-based developer Village Ventures.If the proposed program can bring in half a million dollars to help cover infrastructure costs – about 10-15% of the project’s total estimated price tag, Richard said – it could make the neighborhood, currently in its pre-development stage, pencil out.CHIP is essentially a small-scale version of Vermont’s longstanding tax increment financing program, or TIF, which allows municipalities to borrow money for public infrastructure like roads, sidewalks, and wastewater projects in an area where they want to see growth – with the expectation that new infrastructure will spur new development. The increased tax revenue from the new development then pays off the debt for the infrastructure.The complexity involved in managing large TIF districts means that only Vermont’s larger cities and towns have used them. CHIP is designed to use the same tax increment financing concept, but at the scale of a single property. “CHIP allows communities – especially, I think, our smaller communities – to say, ‘What’s that one project? What’s that one piece of infrastructure that we could put in, that we would bond for once, that could be a catalyst for housing development?’” said Megan Sullivan, a lobbyist for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce and a former executive director of the Vermont Economic Progress Council, which oversees the TIF program. Developers big and small have voiced their support for CHIP, and the new housing advocacy group Let’s Build Homes, of which Richards is a board member, has thrown its full weight behind it. Gov. Phil Scott’s administration proposed a similar program at the outset of this year’s legislative session and officials have indicated their continued support. The housing package that contains CHIP cleared the Senate last month and is currently making its way through the House. Advocates for Vermont municipalities say the program offers a critical new option for cities and towns to spur housing development and grow their grand lists. Right now, to fund new infrastructure, municipalities have to raise property taxes or water rates, said Samantha Sheehan, a lobbyist for the Vermont League of Cities and Towns. Or municipalities can go to the state for a grant – an option that only exists when funding is made available through the state budget. READ MORE





 


Phil Scott outlines proposal for making it ‘faster, easier and less expensive’ to build housing

The other way municipalities get new infrastructure, Sheehan said, is when housing developers pay for it themselves – and bake the cost of infrastructure into the price of housing.“That raises rents or homeownership for whomever moves into that housing development first,”Sheehan said. CHIP aims to move away from that model. CHIP is not the first “project-based TIF” program to circulate around the Legislature in recent years, Sullivan said. Prior versions haven’t made it to the finish line because of concerns that plague the TIF program more broadly: that development that has occurred in TIF districts would have happened even without the financing mechanism, and therefore hasn’t justified the foregone property tax revenue to the state’s overstretched Education Fund.CHIP has garnered similar critiques. State Auditor Doug Hoffer, a frequent critic of Vermont’s TIF program, has become the CHIP initiative’s most vocal detractor in recent weeks. In an interview, Hoffer emphasized that the Legislature’s nonpartisan financial analysts have not been able to determine the fiscal impacts of CHIP due to a host of unknown factors: the scope of the program’s eventual utilization, the size of future projects, and “the amount of development that would occur absent the program,” according to a Joint Fiscal Office memo from early April.Hoffer also challenged whether the CHIP program as currently envisioned would provide an adequate public benefit, if it ultimately gives an incentive to the builders of market-rate homes. He argued that CHIP should include an affordability requirement for the housing it helps finance.“Otherwise, you’re going to have developers doing what they do. They’re going to seek to maximize profit – and that’s capitalism,” he said. “But if that doesn’t serve a really serious public need, then I’m asking myself, why do we need this program?” Affordable housing funders have echoed the need to incentivize income-restricted housing as part of the program. Because financing capacity would be a function of property value, higher-value homes would bring the largest benefits under the CHIP program, Gus Seelig, executive director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, told lawmakers on Thursday.“It pushes against building more modest homes because it’ll produce a smaller tax base upon which you’d be able to pay off the infrastructure,” he said.But other proponents of CHIP have argued that its flexibility is key to its ultimate success.“The reality is that in order to achieve 36,000 homes in five years, we need policy that is housing-type agnostic,” Sheehan said, referring to a recent statewide housing needs assessment. “We need housing types of all kinds that are built in every community at the density that’s appropriate for that community.” The House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development is currently considering changes to the bill, like honing in on what types of infrastructure improvements can qualify, where CHIP projects will be allowed, and how much housing a proposed project must have, versus commercial space. “We want to make sure that we’re doing due diligence – we have, you know, good guardrails around the program. But not hampering it so much that they won’t be able to do anything,” said Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry, the committee’s chair.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed infrastructure financing program would allow even small Vermont towns to incentivize housing.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/housing-construction-5-20220531.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents around the Milwaukee County Courthouse continue to spur controversy. Late last week, ICE agents arrested Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. Flores-Ruiz appeared in Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan’s court on April 18, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
Now, the FBI is investigating whether Dugan helped an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest after that immigrant appeared in her courtroom. Although the immigrant hasn’t been identified, Flores-Ruiz, whose immigration status is unclear, “appears to match the description,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On April 23, Dugan declined to comment on the investigation or possible legal proceedings. ICE officials referred questions to the FBI’s Milwaukee office, which also declined to comment. The Journal Sentinel reported that an email sent by Chief Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Carly Ashley said that ICE agents came to the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 with an arrest warrant. Dugan wasn’t mentioned in Ashley’s communication, which went on to say that ICE agents arrived in the morning, identified themselves to security, and went to the sixth floor where Dugan’s courtroom is located.
Ashley said that the agents were asked to wait until court proceedings were over, and that their actions were consistent with draft policies. Dugan responded to the email, however, saying “a warrant was not presented in the hallway on the 6th floor,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Instead, unnamed sources in the story said that Dugan didn’t hide a defendant, but rather took the defendant and an attorney to a side door which led to a private hallway into a public area on the sixth floor.
It was the third time since March that ICE agents arrived at the courthouse to conduct arrests. Two arrests were made in March and April, with one of the individuals arrested after appearing  in family court for a hearing on a domestic violence restraining order, which was ultimately dismissed. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said that Dugan acted in “defense of due process by preventing ICE from shamefully using her courtroom as an ad hoc holding area for deportations.” Clancy added that “we cannot have a functional legal system if people are justifiably afraid to show up for legal proceedings, especially when ICE agents have already repeatedly grabbed people off the street in retaliation for speech and free association, without even obtaining proper warrants.” 
While Clancy praised Dugan, Rep. Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield) said “I have never seen a more irresponsible act by an officer of the court, let alone a judge, if true.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_2397-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

(Photo provided by Louisiana Office of Tourism)A nascent industry for buying and selling restaurant reservations could meet its end soon in Louisiana. State lawmakers unanimously advanced a bill Thursday that forces such trading platforms to officially partner with the restaurants whose tables are going to the highest bidder. So far, the trading has taken place without any input or involvement from the dining establishments.    
House Bill 90, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, cleared the Louisiana House of Representatives in an 89-0 vote without debate. It seeks to ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and ResX from arranging reservations through their platforms if they do not have explicit contracts with the restaurants. 
Hebert said he doesn’t want to ban the trading apps’ existence; he just wants them to get the restaurants’ permission before operating in Louisiana. 
Reservation trading platforms allow diners with hard-to-get table reservations to sell them online in auction-style transactions similar to eBay. Prospective buyers can also use the platforms as a concierge service, offering a flat fee to anyone who can secure them a table at a particular establishment. 
While the practice of paying for restaurant reservations is more common in places such as New York and Miami, the trading platforms came under scrutiny in Louisiana after the Illuminator reported on the high-dollar trades in the New Orleans market during Super Bowl weekend. They included a $2,138 reservation for a table of four at Antoine’s.
Hebert amended his bill on the floor, adding a provision that would allow the Louisiana attorney general to seek restitution on behalf of anyone who purchases an unlawfully sold reservation. Some diners are buying reservations without realizing the restaurants are not actually selling them, he said. 
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

“We’re not talking about Chik-fil-A here,” Hebert said in an interview after his bill was approved. “It’s a select group of restaurants they’re doing this to …They’re profiting off of a restaurant’s brand, and the restaurants don’t even know about it.”
The bill originated from a dispute between online restaurant booking platforms — such as OpenTable and Resy — and the newer reservation trading platforms.  Hebert sponsored the legislation on behalf of the Louisiana Restaurant Association, which modeled it after a state law New York adopted last year with the backing of booking sites.
If trading platforms can secure partnerships with restaurants, they would pose a threat to the established booking apps. The trading apps make money by taking a percentage of the winning bid price for each trade, whereas OpenTable and the other booking platforms make their money by charging restaurants a fee every time someone reserves a table through their sites. 
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said he is currently offering contracts to restaurants that will give them an equal share of the winning bids for every reservation. It would give dining businesses a new revenue stream from something that currently costs them money, he said. 
The viability of the reservation trading business model depends on whether there is genuine demand for seats at a particular restaurant or whether that demand is artificially inflated just to cash in on wealthy tourists. 
Hebert told his colleagues he believes the trading platforms use software bots to snap up reservations on OpenTable and Resy and then list them for sale on their sites. 
Hebert’s bill heads next to the Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)North Dakota is poised to be the first state in the nation to implement a law that provides legal protections for pesticide manufacturers — an issue that has been debated in legislatures across the country in the face of large payouts to cancer victims.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday signed House Bill 1318, which specifies that a label approved by the Environmental Protection Agency acts as sufficient warning to users about the hazards posed by pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup.
Georgia’s General Assembly passed its version of the pesticide protection bill but it has yet to be signed. The National Agricultural Law Center has been tracking the status of similar legislation in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
In Iowa, the bill passed the Senate this year but did not have sufficient support to pass the House, House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters last month.
Elizabeth Burns-Thompson is the executive director of the Modern Ag Alliance, a national group backing the legislation in North Dakota and other states.
“This law sets the standard for states across America to pass legislation similar to HB 1318 and, ultimately, stand up for our farmers,” Burns-Thompson said Thursday in a statement.

Ag groups have lined up behind the pesticide legislation, saying it ensures farmers will have access to chemicals they need to control weeds and insects.
Critics have said the bill will make it harder for people harmed by chemicals to win lawsuits against the manufacturers of chemicals.
Germany-based Bayer, maker of the popular herbicide Roundup, has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars to plaintiffs who claim the product has caused cancer.
The EPA has never determined that Roundup causes cancer. Plaintiffs have still prevailed, in part on the argument that they were not adequately warned.
Brigit Rollins, attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center, wrote earlier this year that almost every pesticide injury lawsuit filed in the past 10 years has included a claim that the pesticide manufacturer failed to warn the plaintiff of the health risks associated with the product.
Rollins was unavailable for comment Thursday, but wrote earlier this month that it was not clear how pesticide laws might affect pending lawsuits, which number in the thousands nationally.
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one being implemented in North Dakota.
A Bayer executive said in an April 14 Wall Street Journal article that the company may have to shut down U.S. production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup.
The pesticide bill in North Dakota sailed through the House of Representatives, where it was introduced, passing unanimously in January.

It faced more debate in the Senate, but was amended and returned to the House. A small group of protesters gathered outside the Capitol the day of the Senate vote, urging members to reject the bill.
Its second vote in the House was much closer, passing 51-40.
As the debate on the bill wrapping up, Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, said, “If we have learned anything, it is that we don’t know all the answers. We don’t know what this bill does.”
She noted that similar legislation has been pushed in other states.
“If it’s just a simple labeling bill, why did 35 other states vote it down?” she asked.
Leaders of North Dakota farm groups expressed their appreciation for the bill Thursday.
“This monumental step forward helps ensure our farmers have the certainty they need to make long-term planning decisions and stay productive in the field,” Justin Sherlock, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association said.
While the debate focused on Roundup, the law applies to other pesticides registered with the state Department of Agriculture.
The North Dakota law will take effect July 1. If signed, the Georgia law would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
Armstrong’s office declined to comment on his decision to sign the bill.

That includes budget approvals, setting tuition rates, green-lighting new academic programs and deciding on campus projects. 
Most members are already appointed by the governor, but three are elected by university alumni.
If passed and signed into law, the budget would give Braun the power to make changes to the board’s makeup as early as July 1.
“I think it’s being done because the current process (has) not maybe yielded the proper results on the entirety of how you want that important part of our state to be run — from curriculum to cost to the whole way one of our flagship universities has been operating. I want to get a board there that is going to be a little more rounded, that’s going to produce better results,” Braun said Thursday.
“I think that we’re going to have a different configuration,” he continued. “That doesn’t mean that an alumni won’t be on it as one of the picks that you have to constitute the board. It would just mean that it’s not required for those three spots.”
Changes coming to IU’s board of trustees
House and Senate Republicans unveiled their 215-plus page budget compromise Wednesday afternoon. 
Amendments buried on pages 181 and 182 aren’t related to spending, however.
Instead, the new language stipulates that all nine members are to be appointed by the governor. Another section gives the governor authority to, “at any time,” remove and replace a board member who was previously elected by the IU alumni.
If the governor swaps a member out, the new appointee serves until the expiration of the term of the replaced member. Otherwise, any of the existing members elected by IU alumni are allowed to serve out the rest of their term. 
The bill sunsets those provisions on Jan. 1, 2028, near the end of Braun’s current term.










I want to get a board there that is going to be a little more rounded, that’s going to produce better results.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


Other new rules require that at least five of the members appointed to the board must be alumni, and five must be residents of Indiana.
The provisions did not appear in previous versions of the state budget.
Mark Bode, an IU spokesperson, told the Indiana Capitol Chronicle on Thursday that the university “is currently reviewing the potential impacts of the proposed state budget” but did not comment further or specifically about the board of trustees provision.
The IU Board of Trustees and IU Alumni Association did not immediately respond to separate requests for comment. Indiana’s Commission for Higher Education (CHE) declined to comment.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, said Thursday that “the concept of having elections where alumni choose is good, practically speaking,” but emphasized that “only a fraction” of the university’s 750,000 were voting.
“So, that’s absolutely not working the way I think people originally … hoped that it would,” he told the Capital Chronicle. “The governor has lots of appointments on the IU board and many other boards, and it just made sense to move back to that space.”
How trustees are chosen
Under current law, Indiana’s governor appoints five members to IU’s board and picks one student representative with the help of a student-led committee. Three other members must be IU graduates and are elected by other alumni.
At present, all serve three-year terms, except the student member whose term lasts just two years.
New budget language shortens student terms to one year and sets a three-term limit on appointed board members.
No other university boards were altered by the latest budget language.
How trustees are selected at other Hoosier colleges and universities varies somewhat — but like IU, others have also traditionally allowed alumni to have a say on one or more members.
At Purdue University, for example, three of the 10 board members are elected by the school’s alumni association, one of whom must be a graduate of the College of Agriculture. The governor appoints the remaining seven members, including a student trustee.
At Ball State University, an alumni council nominates two people to its nine-member board. The same goes for Indiana State University’s alumni council, which also gets two nominees to the school’s nine-person board.
Indiana AG, Comptroller want proof of no funds supporting IU’s Kinsey Institute

There’s no alumni input for Ivy Tech Community College’s board, though, which is made up entirely of gubernatorial appointees.
All 10 Vincennes University trustees — one of which is a student member — are also appointed by the governor: one of whom must be a resident of Knox County, and one must be an alumnus.
The governor similarly chooses all 10 trustees at the University of Southern Indiana, but an alumni “screening committee” helps pick one of the members.
In a Thursday afternoon callout, Monroe County Democrats called the budget provisions “absolutely outrageous.”
“This power grab doesn’t stop there — it attacks tenure, undermines faculty recruitment, and threatens the core of academic freedom,” the county party said in an email release, which pleaded for Hoosiers to call on their legislators in the final hours of the session and demand for trustee language to be deleted from the budget. 
“This isn’t just bad policy — it’s authoritarian, anti-democratic, and not right,” the email added. “This isn’t just an IU issue. It’s a warning shot to every public university in Indiana.”
It’s the second time that IU has been “singled out by the Republican Supermajority,” Democrats noted.
In 2023, Republicans opted to strip all state funding from IU’s Kinsey Institute, which studies sex, gender and reproduction. Its founder, Alfred Kinsey, produced ground-breaking research on sexuality, including the Kinsey Scale. 
Members of the GOP supermajority argued that the institute’s human sexuality research was not in line with the state’s values, and further pointed to reports that Kinsey solicited information from a convicted pedophile for an orgasm study.

Among the crowd were members and supporters of the state-recognized groups and at least 15 House or Senate members. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, the state’s second-highest-ranking official, also attended.Stevens and the other state-recognized tribal leaders urged lawmakers to reject the recent push by Odanak First Nation, the Abenaki tribe centered in Quebec, to revisit the state recognition process, which lawmakers created in 2010. They urged legislators instead to spend time advocating for their own communities’ needs and interests. The latest panel was hosted by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs,  the state-established body tasked with advocating for local Indigenous communities and making recommendations either for or against tribal recognition to state legislators.The state recognition process has come under scrutiny in recent years as leaders from Odanak First Nation and its sister Abenaki community, W8linak First Nation, have maintained that Vermont granted tribal legitimacy to groups whose members largely can’t claim continuous ties to historic Abenaki people, or to any Indigenous people.Chief Don Stevens of the Nulhegan Abenaki band. Photo by Jeb Wallace-Brodeur/VTDiggerInstead, the First Nation’s leaders have contended, many members of Vermont’s groups are appropriating Abenaki identity and leveraging state resources that they should have no claim to, and that instead could be directed to Odanak and W8linak tribal citizens.“It is imperative to correct the errors made and restore the truth,” said Rick O’Bomsawin, chief of Odanak First Nation, in a press release sent out Thursday morning in response to the latest event. “By accepting and promoting these unfounded claims, Vermont authorities contribute to legitimizing cultural and identity fraud, which harms the true descendants and guardians of this heritage.”The Vermont groups’ state-level recognition allows them to access college scholarships, get free hunting and fishing licenses and benefit from certain property tax exemptions. The groups also get some funding and benefits from the federal government, including legal permission to label arts and crafts their members make as “Indian produced.”Odanak and W8linak have federal-level recognition in Canada, which gives them access to relatively greater funding and other resources in that country, and, critically, allows them to claim pieces of land as sovereign territory. Both bands have reserves located northeast of Montreal, though also claim Vermont, among other areas, as part of their unceded territory.One of the Vermont groups, the Missisquoi, applied for recognition from the U.S. federal government in the 1980s but was later rejected, with the government finding that less than 1% of its members could show descent from an Abenaki ancestor. A Vermont Attorney General’s Office report in 2002 arrived at similar conclusions.One of Wednesday’s speakers — former longtime Vermont state archaeologist Giovanna Peebles — challenged those government findings. She told attendees that it would be “a grave mistake” to rely on them because they evaluated Vermont’s groups against a standard for historical documentation that, in her view, not all Indigenous communities can meet. Rather, “the indigeneity of all four state-recognized Abenaki tribes is solidly based on powerful family histories, stories and traditions passed along through families,” Peebles said, noting that she had spent “hundreds of hours” hearing such narratives directly from families in her career. “As archaeologists, we know that most of history was never written down,” she added.Margaret M. Bruchac gives a historical presentation. Photo by Jeb Wallace-Brodeur/VTDiggerMargaret Bruchac, a professor emerita at the University of Pennsylvania who is a member of the Nulhegan group, offered a similar assessment at the panel. Bruchac said that “the lack of trustworthy records obscures the continuing presence” of the groups in Vermont, adding that Indigenous families’ identities in the region may have been written down inaccurately by European colonial officials.  Odanak and W8linak leaders have argued, to the contrary, that historical records are critical to establishing ties to legitimate Indigenous communities — saying that they have never received sufficient evidence of that kind from the groups in Vermont.At the same time, research published in 2023 by Darryl Leroux, a University of Ottawa associate professor who spoke at February’s Statehouse panel, found that many members of the Vermont-recognized groups have little connection to Abenaki ancestors, and instead have French-Canadian ancestry.Some speakers Wednesday also drew a distinction between the history and culture of the state-recognized groups and those of Odanak and W8linak. The Elnu chief, Roger Longtoe Sheehan, said there are “Vermont Abenaki” and “Canadian Abenaki.”READ MORE
Referring to the panel earlier this year with the First Nation leaders based in Quebec, Stevens, the Nulhegan chief, asked lawmakers in the room Wednesday: “Why are we entertaining a foreign entity, in a foreign country, over your own constituents?” The first panel was hosted not by the state but by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington. Headrick has since introduced a bill that would, among a handful of other measures, establish a task force to “review the validity” of the state’s past tribal recognitions.The bill, H.362, had a brief hearing in the House General and Housing Committee earlier this month, though it’s unlikely to advance further this legislative session.During Wednesday’s panel, several lawmakers voiced support for the state-recognized groups, including Rep. Mike Mrowicki, D-Putney, and Rep. Brian Cina, P/D-Burlington. The panel was moderated by former Craftsbury Democratic Rep. Katherine Sims.Perhaps the strongest comments came from Rep. Michael Morgan, R-Milton. “I was at the last presentation, if you want to call it that — maybe I’d call it a hijacking — back two months ago,” he said, before speaking about the Odanak leaders directly.“I don’t know what all their motivations are,” Morgan said. “But they need to leave people here alone.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leaders of Vermont-recognized tribes defiant at Statehouse panel on Abenaki identity.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abenaki-evening-9-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C711&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

Frederica Wilson holds a press conference outside of the Krome North Service Processing Center on April 24, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Alvaro Perpuly with Wilson's office)South Florida’s U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson said she saw a “tent city” that could hold hundreds of people at the Miami immigration detention center on Thursday.
Following her visit to the Krome North Service Processing Center, Wilson told reporters she saw a structure that officials at the center told her had been built in 14 days to house hundreds of detained immigrants.
She referred to the structure as a tent city, but said the two-story building was made out of a harder material than cloth and that it had pipes for air conditioning.
“It’s going to get worse, so every time this facility gets crowded, in order to stay in compliance, they’re going to have to build another one, and it only takes 14 days,” Wilson said during a press conference following her visit to Krome.
“And so what they said to us was, as new detainees come in, they try to ship people out, but they can’t keep up with the pace because of the Laken Riley Act.”
The law Wilson mentioned requires immigration officials to detain immigrants arrested or charged with property crimes, among others.
More people could soon enter Krome following the launch this week of a large-scale operation to detain approximately 800 people in Florida in cooperation between federal authorities and state police, according to the Miami Herald.

Democrat Wilson, who vowed to keep visiting the detention center, said she hasn’t seen overcrowding. However, she believes accounts of detainees, their families, and attorneys.
“This is not my first rodeo. I was down at Homestead when the children were there, and I’ve been to Krome before, and I’ve been to prisons all across Florida, especially female prisons,” Wilson said. “So, I know what they do. They take them on a field trip, so you won’t see who is actually in there, but they did admit that they are building a tent city.”
Miami-Dade Mayor Levine Cava wasn’t allowed to join the visit, Wilson said. Cava requested a tour of the detention center in an April 4 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Groups such as Americans for Immigrant Justice and the ACLU of Florida have called out conditions at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, citing accounts of overcrowding, people sleeping on floors, poor sanitation, and two detainee deaths this year.
ICE did not respond to the Florida Phoenix’s questions about the structure and whether any detainees had been moved out of the center on Thursday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-24 21:19:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge bars Trump from denying federal funds to ‘sanctuary’ cities,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/24/trump-sanctuary-cities-lawsuit-new-haven/,New Haven was among the plaintiffs suing over Trump's executive order barring 'sanctuary' jurisdictions from receiving federal money.,"A federal judge in California on Thursday barred the Trump administration from denying or conditioning the use of federal funds to “sanctuary” jurisdictions, saying that portions of President Donald Trump’s executive orders were unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued the injunction sought by San Francisco and more than a dozen other municipalities that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts.
Orrick wrote that defendants are prohibited “from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds” and the administration must provide written notice of his order to all federal departments and agencies by Monday.
One executive order issued by Trump directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withhold federal money to sanctuary jurisdictions. The second order directs every federal agency to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
At a hearing Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers argued that it was much too early for the judge to grant an injunction when the government had not taken any action to withhold specific amounts or to lay out conditions on specific grants.
But Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said this was essentially what government lawyers argued during Trump’s first term when the Republican issued a similar order.
“Their well-founded fear of enforcement is even stronger than it was in 2017,” Orrick wrote, citing the executive orders as well as directives from Bondi, other federal agencies and Justice Department lawsuits filed against Chicago and New York.
San Francisco successfully challenged the 2017 Trump order and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court that the president exceeded his authority when he signed an executive order threatening to cut funding for “sanctuary cities.”
There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.
Leaders of sanctuary jurisdictions say their communities are safer because immigrants feel they can communicate with local police without fear of deportation. It is also a way for municipalities to focus their dollars on crime locally, they say.
Besides San Francisco and Santa Clara County, which includes a third plaintiff, the city of San José, there are 13 other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which include Seattle and King County, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; New Haven, Connecticut; and Santa Fe, New Mexico.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113797609746-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

(Getty Images)A child traveling through Kentucky was diagnosed with measles in March, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) announced Thursday. 
The child isn’t a United States resident, CHFS said. The child’s vaccination status and age were not provided. 
The child was diagnosed while being treated at a “health care facility in Kentucky,” the cabinet said. 
The case did not result in exposures for others, the cabinet said, because “the health care facility adhered to strict safety protocols.” 
This is the second confirmed case of measles in Kentucky this year. The first was reported in February in a Kentuckian who attended Frankfort Planet Fitness. 
Kentuckian has confirmed case of measles

Meanwhile, CHFS reports that amid “the largest outbreak of measles in the United States since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000,” not enough Kentucky school children are getting immunizations. 
“Coverage among kindergartners for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is effective at preventing diseases, including measles, and is legally required for school attendance in Kentucky, has dropped to 86.9%, which is lower than the national average of 93%,” CHFS said. This is a decline from 90% in the 2023-2024 school year. 
Measles is extremely contagious and is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect nine in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
“These are concerning trends that we are seeing,” Dr. Steven Stack, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement. “It is really important that folks are properly informed about vaccines so they can take safe steps to protect their children. Vaccines are safe and effective. We urge all parents to have their children vaccinated to ensure they are protected from preventable diseases like measles.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A bill to create grocery reinvestment and local food processing grant programs advanced Thursday from the Iowa House of Representatives.
House File 1032 aims to help rural areas of the state retain grocery stores and expand local food systems with the goal of preventing rural food deserts. 
Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield, said rural grocery stores are often just “one freezer breakdown or one cooler breakdown away from having to close their doors.”
“This bill can help bridge the gap between local producers, processors and consumers,” Latham said. 
Through the grocery reinvestment program, existing or new grocery stores could apply for funds to expand capacity, upgrade utilities, purchase equipment or technology and cover professional costs. 
Recipients must provide matching funds and financial assistance could not exceed $100,000. Grocery chains with 10 or more stores would not be eligible.
The bill also creates a program for local food processing grants that would expand the availability, access, efficiency and capacity of local food processing in a community. 
The local food processing grant program would have $100,000, or 10% of the total allocated fund, annually to award to eligible local processing projects that source goods from more than one Iowa farm.
Earlier versions of the bill, House File 59, and House File 550, included an appropriation of $2 million, from the general fund, to the programs. 
This section was not in the version of the bill that passed on the floor. Advocates of the bill said they have been told by lawmakers that an appropriation is expected, though it likely won’t be the full amount from the initial bill.
Cynthia Farmer, Iowa policy manager with the Center for Rural Affairs, said the group is “excited” to see the bill advance and is hopeful for buy in from Senate appropriators.
“Although we may not receive the full appropriation requested in the initial bill, we continue to ask legislators to invest the $2 million appropriation,” Farmer said in a statement.

Amendments 
The bill had three proposed amendments, the first of which was introduced by Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, to amend the definition of a rural grocery store. 
“The intent of this bill is to make sure that our rural areas, that are more prone to be food desert areas… are able to take advantage of this program,” Harris said. 
The amendment, which was adopted, expands the definition of an eligible rural grocery store to a business where 50% of the retail space, or 30% of revenue, relate to general line food retail. 
Harris said this would account for grocery stores that share space with other businesses, like a fuel stop or a diner, as is common in rural towns. 
The second amendment, brought forth by Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, did not pass, but would have addressed the “real problem” of price discrimination by distributors who favor corporate stores. 
“For decades, we’ve had out-of-state corporations undercut local grocers — that’s the problem,” Scholten said. 
Scholten said it would stop suppliers from giving preferential pricing to established corporate stores over local grocers. 
“This will allow your local grocer to play on an even field,” Scholten said. 
Latham recommended a “no” vote on the amendment because she did not have an opportunity to speak with the office of the attorney general or other noted offices in the amendment. The amendment failed 58-31. 
The final amendment, brought forth by Rep. Chad Ingels, R-Randalia, moved the local processing element of the bill under the purview of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, instead of Iowa Economic Development Authority, where the rest of the program is managed. 
The amendment would also prioritize funding for local facilities that process goods from three or more Iowa farms, participate in the Choose Iowa program or sell to a rural grocery store. 
Rep. Ken Croken, D-Davenport, said all of the amendments made the “good bill better and better.” 
HF 1032 passed with no dissenting votes and moves to the Senate.

(Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)North Dakota is poised to be the first state in the nation to implement a law that provides legal protections for pesticide manufacturers — an issue that has been debated in legislatures across the country in the face of large payouts to cancer victims. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday signed House Bill 1318 that specifies that a label approved by the Environmental Protection Agency acts as sufficient warning to users about the hazards posed by pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup. 
Georgia’s General Assembly passed its version of the pesticide protection bill but it has yet to be signed. The National Agricultural Law Center has been tracking the status of similar legislation in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
Elizabeth Burns-Thompson is the executive director of the Modern Ag Alliance, a national group backing the legislation in North Dakota and other states.  
“This law sets the standard for states across America to pass legislation similar to HB 1318 and, ultimately, stand up for our farmers,” Burns-Thompson said Thursday in a statement.

Ag groups have lined up behind the pesticide legislation, saying it ensures farmers will have access to chemicals they need to control weeds and insects. 
Critics have said the bill will make it harder for people harmed by chemicals to win lawsuits against the manufacturers of chemicals. 
Pesticide cancer claims at issue in bill headed for North Dakota Senate vote

Germany-based Bayer, maker of the popular herbicide Roundup, has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars to plaintiffs who claim the product has caused cancer. 
The EPA has never determined that Roundup causes cancer. Plaintiffs have still prevailed, in part on the argument that they were not adequately warned. 
Brigit Rollins, attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center, wrote earlier this year that almost every pesticide injury lawsuit filed in the past 10 years has included a claim that the pesticide manufacturer failed to warn the plaintiff of the health risks associated with the product.
Rollins was unavailable for comment Thursday, but wrote earlier this month that it was not clear how pesticide laws might affect pending lawsuits, which number in the thousands nationally. 
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one being implemented in North Dakota. 
A Bayer executive said in an April 14 Wall Street Journal article that the company may have to shut down U.S. production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. 
The pesticide bill in North Dakota sailed through the House of Representatives, where it was introduced, passing unanimously in January.

It faced more debate in the Senate, but was amended and returned to the House. A small group of protesters gathered outside the Capitol the day of the Senate vote, urging members to reject the bill.
Its second vote in the House was much closer, passing 51-40.
As the debate on the bill wrapping up, Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, said, “If we have learned anything, it is that we don’t know all the answers. We don’t know what this bill does.” 
She noted that similar legislation has been pushed in other states. 
“If it’s just a simple labeling bill, why did 35 other states vote it down?” she asked. 
Leaders of North Dakota farm groups expressed their appreciation for the bill Thursday. 
“This monumental step forward helps ensure our farmers have the certainty they need to make long-term planning decisions and stay productive in the field,” Justin Sherlock, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association said. 
While the debate focused on Roundup, the law applies to other pesticides registered with the state Department of Agriculture. 
The North Dakota law will take effect July 1. If signed, the Georgia law would take effect Jan. 1, 2026. 
Armstrong’s office declined to comment on his decision to sign the bill.

Senate Bill 25-129 builds on a 2023 shield law that protects out-of-state patients who come to Colorado for care and the providers who treat them. There have been multiple cases this year of states that outlaw abortion pursuing criminal charges against out-of-state doctors who prescribe abortion medication via telehealth. 
The bill allows providers to exclude their names from medication abortion prescription labels to protect their privacy. It also requires any subpoena requests to include an affirmation that it does not pertain to reproductive or gender-affirming care.
“There’s fear from our health care providers about being able to provide the best health care they can and use their skills. There’s fear from patients accessing care, especially if they’re traveling from out of state. There’s fear from parents and counselors. And we hope that this bill gives hope,” said bill sponsor Sen. Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat.










There's fear from our health care providers about being able to provide the best health care they can and use their skills. There's fear from patients accessing care, especially if they’re traveling from out of state. There's fear from parents and counselors. And we hope that this bill gives hope.


– State Sen. Faith Winter


Since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned of Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion, Colorado has become an island of reproductive health care as surrounding states criminalize abortion. In 2023, about 29% of people who got an abortion in Colorado were from another state, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. That share was a little over 10% in 2019.
Insurance for abortion
Polis also signed Senate Bill 25-183, which implements Amendment 79, a constitutional update that Colorado voters approved in 2024. It puts the right to abortion into the state constitution and removes a ban on using public funds to cover abortion care. Beginning next year, state employees and people on Medicaid will have the care covered by their insurance. Amendment 79 passed with about 62% of the vote.
“By signing these bills into law, Governor Polis reaffirms Colorado’s role as a national leader for reproductive justice and freedom,” Dusti Gurule, the president of Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, which co-chaired the Amendment 79 effort, said in a statement. “But this achievement is truly a reflection of community power. Thousands of Coloradans from across the state organized, advocated, and mobilized to fight for these bills that allow them to lead safer, healthier, and more self-determined lives.”
Another bill modeled after federal standards for emergency medical care, including abortion, passed the Senate and has been introduced in the House but does not have a committee hearing scheduled. The legislative session ends on May 7.

,Source New Mexico,2025-04-24 21:05:15+00:00,Source New Mexico,Torrez’s CYFD investigation will fail if it leaves people out,Richard Wexler,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/04/24/torrezs-cyfd-investigation-will-fail-if-it-leaves-people-out/,A child welfare expert weighs in on New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez' latest effort to reform NM's foster system,"New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez says he’s going to launch “a comprehensive and wide-ranging investigation” into how the Children, Youth and Families Department fails children. Allow me to save him some time. I can just write the report now — and I’ll throw in the news story that will follow. The story will go like this:
The beleaguered Children Youth and Families Department and its embattled leadership are plagued with a shortage of foster parents and high turnover among demoralized, overworked and understaffed caseworkers, according to the blistering conclusions in a scathing report released today.
We know this is what the report will say for a couple of reasons. First, almost (but not quite) all of that is true. Indeed CYFD’s performance is every bit as awful as Torrez says it is. Second, it’s what scathing reports on embattled child welfare agencies all over the country always say, particularly when those issuing the reports show no interest in real solutions.
Real solutions have been in short supply in New Mexico. Instead, there’s an endless appetite for rearranging the deck chairs on the child welfare Titanic: Create an ombudsman office! Take the agency out of the control of the governor! Move some functions to another agency! None of that ever works.
Real solutions involve a single urgent first step: Viewing those who are investigated by CYFD and who lose their children to foster care as fully human — and worth talking to. That’s not for the sake of the parents; it’s for the sake of the children. Because it’s the families needlessly investigated and the children needlessly taken who overload the system. That leads to tragedies ranging from children warehoused in hideous institutions or makeshift spaces to children in real danger overlooked in their own homes.
It’s not easy to rethink the stereotypes. We know the horror stories about brutally abusive or hopelessly addicted parents; but they’re nothing like most of the parents caseworkers see.
In 2022, the most recent year for which data are available, 78% of cases in which children were thrown into foster care in New Mexico did not involve even an accusation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. Nearly two-thirds did not involve even an accusation of parental drug or alcohol abuse. In contrast, more than two-thirds involved “neglect.” Sometimes that can be extremely serious; more often it means the family is poor. Indeed, CYFD admits that in 19% of cases, it took away children because of issues involving housing.
So it’s no wonder study after study finds that in typical cases children left in their own homes typically do better in later life even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care.
In part, that’s because of the enormous emotional trauma inherent in tearing a child from everyone loving and familiar. But there’s also the high risk of abuse in foster care itself.  Multiple studies find abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes; the rate in group homes and institutions is even worse. But when you overload the system with children who don’t need to be there you create an artificial “shortage” of foster homes — so more children are institutionalized, with all the horrible outcomes New Mexicans have seen.
At the same time, all those false allegations, trivial cases and poverty cases overload workers, leaving them less time to investigate any case properly. That’s almost always the real reason some children in real danger are missed.
Real solutions demand doing more to ameliorate the worst hardships of poverty, and providing families with high-quality defense counsel; not to get “bad parents” off, but to provide alternatives to the cookie-cutter “service plans” often dished out by CYFD.
But understanding that requires that first basic step: treating parents as fully human. Attorney General Torrez doesn’t seem ready for that. As Source NM reported:
Torrez’s agency is also calling on current and former case workers, foster families, and youth impacted by the system to come forward with information …
He’s right to do that. But notice who’s missing.  He expresses no interest in hearing from birth parents who have lost children to the system because their poverty is confused with neglect.  He shows no interest in hearing from the lawyers who represent them. He shows no interest in reaching out to anti-poverty organizations to ask them what they see when their clients interact with CYFD. He shows no interest in speaking to civil rights groups about whether they see all races treated equally when they encounter CYFD.
That’s a shame. Because, to paraphrase Torrez, I think we have all grown tired of waking up and hearing about another grandstanding politician holding another news conference to announce another investigation of CYFD that will solve nothing — because it avoids the problem at the root of all the rest: The only way to fix foster care is to have less of it.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYFD2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A few months ago, South Dakota State Librarian George Seamon got an invite to a Pizza Ranch lunch with members of the South Dakota Library Association.
The invite had come at a trying time.  
Weeks earlier, former Gov. Kristi Noem had released a budget that would’ve slashed the State Library to a bare-bones operation. Were lawmakers to go along with the cuts, the lion’s share of the services that flow from the State Library to the association’s member libraries — interlibrary loans, summer reading program assistance, professional development and access to dozens of paid database services for use by local patrons border to border — would have disappeared.
‘After all our hard work’: Federal fallout leads to suspension of interlibrary loan courier service

But something else happened between the budget address and the Pizza Ranch meet-up: Seamon’s organization benefited from a groundswell of support. 
Dozens of libraries had shared news stories of the cuts’ potential impact on social media. Librarians had peppered legislators with letters and calls. Members of the public had done the same.
On Thursday, Seamon held back tears recounting to the State Library Board what had happened when he showed up at the restaurant to connect with some of those supporters.
“As soon as I walked in, everybody stood and clapped,” Seamon recalled about the meeting, which took place after the first legislative hearing on State Library funding. “And that wasn’t for me. That was for the State Library.”
By the end of the legislative session, lawmakers had reached a compromise to spare the library. Four employees would depart, and some services would be pared back. The library board — which had its final meeting Thursday in Pierre — would dissolve. But most of the organization’s services would survive.
Joe Graves, secretary for the state’s Department of Education and overseer of the State Library, worked hard to find that compromise, Seamon told the board. Lawmakers stepped in to back Graves’ plan.
There was a sigh of relief in the library community, but it didn’t last.
State Library faces Trump threat to federal funding after escaping the Noem knife

The path forward had protected enough state funding to preserve about a million dollars in federal matching funds from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS). But shortly after the legislative session’s end, President Trump issued an executive order designed to pare down IMLS to the greatest extent possible under the law.
Congress had authorized funding for IMLS grants, with enough money to extend the grant the State Library expected for this year. But some opponents of the executive order were concerned that staffing cuts at IMLS would make it impossible for the institute to process grant requests.
“We saw that light at the end of the tunnel, then we were let back down,” Seamon said Thursday.
But this week, Seamon got notice that South Dakota’s grant funding was on the way. The librarian told the board that IMLS had released half the money, and asked for documentation of the library’s operational plans to release the other half.
“Based on those assurances, I strongly believe that we will receive the second half of our grant,” Seamons told the board.
It hasn’t been easy to see State Library staff go, Seamon said, but he reported that each staff member has secured new employment. One will work closely with the library, as she’s taken a position with a nonprofit organization that creates summer reading program materials and helps disseminate them, often through state libraries. Another will work for the public library in Pierre. A digitization specialist took a job at a bank. 
One of the State Library’s longer-term employees will retire. 
“I’m jealous, because I’m a lot farther away in life from retirement,” Seamon said.
He didn’t get a standing ovation from the dissolving board of citizen advisers to whom he reported those details, and details on the library’s current culling of its non-fiction collection, much of which will become the property of the State Historical Society. 
Seamon and his organization weren’t spared from gratitude and compliments, though.
Lawmakers decline to endorse Noem-backed state library funding cut, school safety grant program

Board President Tom Nelson said the state should’ve thought more carefully before targeting an organization that runs “as quietly and efficiently” as the State Library. Board member Kim Borsch, a 20-year member of the local library board in Lead, thanked Nelson for helping her get onto the state board, then thanked Seamon and the State Library staff for the opportunity to peer under the hood of an organization whose work she admires.
Jane Norling of Beresford, the board’s vice president, lamented the loss of the board and reiterated Nelson’s hope that lawmakers consider renewing a smaller version of it to serve as a voice for rural library patrons.
Seamon thanked the board members for their kind words and reiterated his gratitude to Graves and the other departments that showed support to the State Library through the “emotional ride” of the past five months.
He added, “It’s definitely something I don’t want to go through again.”
The future of the State Library is not assured, however. In 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, Congress authorized grant funding for IMLS through the end of September 2025. Its members will soon need to decide whether to authorize another round of the grant funding that props up state libraries across the U.S.

(Aidan Cornue | West Virginia Watch)The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed a lawsuit Thursday on behalf of a West Virginia University student whose visa the Trump administration revoked. 
The ACLU-WV filed the suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. The complaint names Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
According to a news release, Sajawal Ali Sohail, a 25-year-old computer science student from Pakistan, received an email April 10 that his visa had been revoked because he appeared in a criminal database. 
Sohail was never convicted of a crime, the ACLU said, his family was actually the victim of one. According to the complaint, WVU police questioned Sohail in 2023 as part of an investigation into his tuition payments. Sohail’s father had been scammed by someone who offered to pay for Sohail’s tuition, but the person had used stolen cards to make the first payment. 
Sohail was initially charged in the incident but the charges were dismissed, according to the complaint. 
“Our client has been victimized three times now — once by a scammer, then again by police who incorrectly charged him with a crime, and now a third time by the Trump administration for citing that charge as grounds to endanger his legal status in the country,” ACLU Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in a news release.  
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press. That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. The ACLU-WV filed a similar lawsuit late last week on behalf of a Marshall University graduate student from India whose visa was revoked. A judge on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order allowing the Marshall student to stay in the country. 
“We’ve heard time and again from the Trump administration that they only want to remove  criminals from the country, but we know that simply isn’t the case,” ACLU-WV Executive  Director Eli Baumwell said in the news release. “It’s obvious the administration has embarked on a policy of mass terminations regardless of the facts. We look forward to a court’s ruling on Mr. Sohail’s case.” 
Sohail, who would be set to graduate next month, said he still wants to pursue job opportunities in the United States. 
“This has been an incredibly stressful time for me,” he said in a news release. “I am losing my hair due to stress, I could not sleep in my own house for fear of getting arrested and deported. I am a good student from a good family, and I don’t deserve this.
“All my family and I have wanted since day one is to do everything the right way, the legal way, and I just want to complete my degree here in the U.S,” he said.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC_2277-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Sen. Stacy Brenner introduced a bill during a public hearing Thursday that would allow the state to better financially support farmers during unexpected events and emergencies. 
“This is not a hypothetical concern,” Brenner (D-Cumberland) told the Legislature’s Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee. “Farmers across Maine are facing unprecedented challenges from increasing erratic and extreme weather to the uncertainty of federal support.”
Brenner’s bill, LD 1605, comes after more than 100 farmers and supporters — including U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree — paraded through Augusta last week to protest federal cuts to agricultural grants and programs. In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has cut several programs that have provided millions of dollars and critical support to Maine farms.
Just last week, the federal agency ended the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which has provided over $477 million to help Maine farms subsidize projects focused on integrating climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices. 
A cost-sharing program that helps integrate conservation practices into working lands is also under threat as the Trump administration has tried to freeze one of its funding sources: the Inflation Reduction Act.
Beyond these sizable cuts, Maine farmers have expressed concern over President Donald Trump’s back and forth on tariffs that they say could eat away at their already thin profit margins.

LD 1605 would allow the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to use one of its existing funds to grant zero-interest loans to farmers in the event of a disaster or loss of funds due to federal cuts. The proposal is co-sponsored by Republicans and Democrats in both chambers. 
“This is smart, targeted investment in rural resilience, food security and the future of Maine’s agriculture,” said Brenner, who also serves as president and CEO of Maine Farmland Trust and owns Broadturn Farm in Scarborough.
The department is in favor of the bill because it currently lacks a mechanism to distribute rapid emergency funds, said Director Megan Patterson. She told the committee that this legislation could offer that “crucial bridge funding” for farmers during unpredictable times. 
An original version of this bill sought to include food banks, which have also been hit by federal cuts to a program that would have provided $1.25 million to Maine over the next three years for food banks to source fresh produce from local growers. Brenner said she decided to move forward with a proposal that utilized existing funding levers and had to make the hard choice to leave food banks out. 
Good Shepherd Food Bank said it supports the bill even with the changes because of its strong partnership with Maine’s farming community.
Maine Farmland Trust and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association also both spoke in support of the bill.

(Mark Cornelison/Administrative Office of the Courts) A state law limiting the power of Jefferson County’s elected school board will get a second look from the Kentucky Supreme Court, thanks to its newest member.
In a 4-3 order Thursday, the court granted the school board’s request for a rehearing and withdrew a ruling it issued in December that had upheld the 2022 law.
The court also split 4-3 in December in support of the law which is written in a way that could apply only to the Louisville school district.
A change in justices accounts for the court granting the rehearing.
Justice Pamela Goodwine, elected in November, replaced former Chief Justice Laurance VanMeter who was part of the narrow majority that upheld the law. Goodwine is part of the narrow majority that now wants to hear more arguments.
On Thursday, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman, whose office is defending the law, said, “We are stunned by the Kentucky Supreme Court’s ruling to undo its own decision. We will redouble our efforts to defend the interests of Kentucky students and uphold the rule of law.”
Jefferson County Board of Education chair the Rev. Corrie Shull said, “We appreciate the Supreme Court’s willingness to take another look at this case.”
In earlier rulings a Jefferson Circuit judge and the Kentucky Court of Appeals both found the law was unconstitutional. The lower court judges said the law violates Kentucky’s Constitution by singling out one school district for special legislation.
KY Supreme Court narrowly upholds law that singles out Jefferson County Public Schools

While the law does not mention Jefferson County by name, “the provisions plainly singled out counties with a certain type of governance that exists only in Jefferson County,” said the appeals court decision.
The Supreme Court disagreed, saying that the legislation is aimed at a class — county school districts with a consolidated local government — not a “particular individual, object, or locale” and that other districts could meet that definition in the future, even if it now applies only to Jefferson County.
The law’s limits on the Jefferson County school board were a priority for Republican lawmakers who are frequent critics of the Louisville schools and the Jefferson County Teachers Association.
Republican Senate President Robert Stivers praised the Supreme Court ruling in December, calling it “a shot across the bow to Kentucky’s largest school district, one which continues to fail its students, particularly low-income and minority students.”
Goodwine’s campaign last year received financial backing from the Kentucky Education Association and Jefferson County Teachers Association, which represent educators, as well as from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s political action committee. 
Beshear had vetoed the law but was overridden by the legislature’s Republican supermajority.
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case Aug. 6 in Lexington.

Brian Sandoval, who currently serves as president of the University of Nevada, Reno, is one of 435 university and college presidents and chancellors to sign on to a letter protesting the “unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American education.”
The letter from the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), which is clearly directed at President Donald Trump without mentioning him by name, opposes “undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.”
The AAC&U letter, Sandoval said via email, “refers to the essential role that our colleges and universities play in our society in educating students to sustain our democracy, ensuring that faculty and staff have academic freedom and that our campuses in general remain places where the individual freedoms of all people are not curtailed or used as a means for punishment.”
The message also “affirms the multitude of benefits that further all segments of our world through the work that comes from public research funding,” Sandoval said. 
Last week, Trump froze $2.2 billion in research funding designated for Harvard University, which refused to capitulate to the president’s political demands, “including federal audits of Harvard’s programs, agreements to screen international students for their beliefs, and the installation of administrators who will ensure the White House’s demands are carried out,” the Harvard Crimson reported. Harvard is suing the Trump administration.
And earlier this week Trump signed a slew of executive orders on education, including one that aims to “overhaul” college accreditation. 
During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to fire “radical Left accreditors,” claiming they “have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.”
“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” says the AAC&U letter. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”
Four Nevada institutions – UNR, the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), Nevada State University (NSU), and the College of Southern Nevada (CSN) – are members of AAC&U. 
As of Wednesday, NSU President DeRionne Pollard had not been asked to sign the letter, according to a spokesperson, who says Pollard is “in the process of reviewing the public statement.”

Douglas Burns, former co-owner of an Iowa newspaper that was nearly bankrupted by such a lawsuit celebrated the bill’s passage.
“This is a big day for Iowa, it’s a big day for democracy, it’s a big day for community newspapers,” Burns said in an interview. “And most of all, it’s a big day for the truth.”
House File 472 deals with “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits, a term referring to civil lawsuits filed by organizations, businesses or individuals against news organizations or activists because they have published articles or made statements about a topic the plaintiff does not want them to publicize. The entities filing these lawsuits do not necessarily expect to win in court, but aim to stop individuals or groups from continuing to report or talk about the topic by engaging them in a legal battle that costs them significant time and money.
The issue came to Iowa lawmakers’ attention when a Carroll police officer sued the Carroll Times Herald in 2018 for reporting that he had sexual relationships with teenagers, which the officer had confirmed was true. The judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the legal fees, totaling more than $100,000, nearly caused the paper to go out of business.
The bill seeks to prevent similar situations by allowing courts to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights, including freedoms of speech and press.
As of January 2025, 35 states and the District of Columbia have similar anti-SLAPP laws in place. Rep. Steve Holt, R-Denison, has been the main proponent of Iowa joining these states. During floor debate on the bill Thursday, he said he began having conversations about anti-SLAPP legislation in 2018.
“This is the fourth or fifth time we’ve passed anti-SLAPP legislation,” Holt said. “… We passed this numerous times, never advanced in the Senate. This year, it did advance in the Senate.”
The measure came back to the House with an amendment removing the ability to grant expedited relief for a “cause of action asserted in a civil action.” The amendment striking this provision would mean anti-SLAPP protections cannot be applied retroactively, a situation Holt said rarely occurs.
“This amendment really does nothing in terms of the fact that were this to be signed into law, it will be on the books going forward, which will be … a tremendous victory in trying to protect our small town newspapers and media outlets from being put out of business,” Holt said.
The amendment was approved unanimously, and goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval.
Holt said he corresponded with Burns, the former co-owner of the Carroll Times Herald, who he said “spent $140,000 defending himself in court after telling the truth and basically lost his newspaper as a result,” about the bill earlier Thursday.
Speaking with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Burns said the bill’s passage “proves that the ashes of a business can be the foundation for something durable and meaningful in Iowa.”
He thanked Holt for his “tenacity and determination” in advocating for the bill for years in the Legislature, and praised the bill’s passage with bipartisan support.
“It just shows that sometimes the truth can be apparent to all, and the truth can prevail,” Burns said. “With this legislation in place, assuming the governor will sign it, it should secure more truthful outcomes to a variety of stories and scenarios in our state for generations.”

Laura Kelly greets 11-month-old Brynn, daughter of Sen. Tory Marie Blew, before speaking about the importance of creating the Office of Early Childhood. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Surrounded by the shouts and chatter of children playing, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly on Thursday signed legislation consolidating the state’s early childhood services under one department and supporting creation of more child care openings.
“When I ran for governor in 2018, I often said that, should I leave a legacy, I wanted to leave behind the most comprehensive early childhood system in the nation, so that our children, their families, our businesses and our communities could thrive,” Kelly told a crowd gathered at the Kansas Children’s Discovery Center in Topeka.
Kelly signed House Bill 2045, which creates the Office of Early Childhood, effectively consolidating more than 20 Kansas programs having to do with children, child care and other issues under one banner. In addition, the bill is expected to increase availability of much-needed child care slots, although critics have voiced concerns that it softened licensure requirements. 
The bill allows fewer education requirements for some workers in a child care facility and changes ratios of the number of adults to children. It also matches vaccination requirements to those currently in place for children attending school.
Rep. Kirk Haskins, a Topeka Democrat, said he worked on the bill for three years and that the final product, while not without its costs, was effective and good. 
“We do have a day care gap that we have to address,” he said. “But we have to be careful to make sure we’re not changing so much that it harms our children.”
Kelly said some concerns raised about the bill were misguided because people didn’t understand that much of the language included in HB 2045 was already in statute elsewhere. 
“Some of the concerns, like the wording on certain provisions within that, those are things that were already in statute,” she said. “They were just sort of put into the child care conversation, but were already existing. But I felt very comfortable that what we ended up with addressed a lot of concerns.”
Kelly said objections to the vaccination language in HB 2045 was one of those misunderstood issues. 
“That language already exists in state law, and we just put it into child care regulations,” she said. 
  Gov. Laura Kelly called the creation of a new Office of Early Childhood through House Bill 2045 one of the legacies will she leave behind. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)
Sen. Tory Marie Blew, a Great Bend Republican, spoke to the crowd while holding her 11-month-old daughter, Brynn. She said she and her husband put their names on a child care wait list in 2020, and then it took them longer than expected to have a child. A spot didn’t come open until just after their daughter was born in May 2024, she said. 
“Many folks are not working because either they can’t afford it or they don’t have access to it,” Blew said. “The thing about child care is it’s an issue across every state. Hopefully more states will look to Kansas on what we’re doing here.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, equated the legislation to a promise to Kansas families. 
“By establishing the Kansas Office of Early Childhood, this bill takes a transformative step toward making child care in Kansas more accessible, more affordable and more effective,” she said.
“Kansas will now have a centralized, accountable agency with an executive director focused entirely on those early childhood services,” Sykes added. “This means more coordination, less confusion and better results.”
Kelly said it had been clear for some time that the current system in Kansas wasn’t meeting the needs of providers, communities and businesses. This legislation ensures a stronger, more comprehensive and flexible system for providers, she said. 
“We know the earliest years of childhood are crucial in determining the trajectory of one’s entire life, including economic health and social outcomes,” Kelly said. “A robust, flourishing early childhood system not only benefits our children, but it’s also critical to our state’s economic growth and well-being.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-24-25-Kelly-HB2045-1024x745.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Hecklers interrupted a speech Thursday by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a conference on opioid addiction in Nashville.
The Rx and Illicit Drug Summit 2025 drew law enforcement officials, addiction prevention counselors, social workers and public health officers to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center for the three-day event.
For years, Kennedy has drawn ire and disapproval for his anti-vaccine messages and, more recently, for belittling comments about people with autism and budget cuts in his department.
“Believe science!,” shouted a protester before security rushed him from the room. Another protester held aloft a sign that read, “Vaccines save lives.”
Kennedy’s speech was apolitical and focused on his own history in recovery from an addiction to heroin and his recommendations for dealing with the nation’s opioid crisis — many of which focused less on medical or treatment solutions and more on the need to build community, embrace spirituality and take personal responsibility.
After touting a $4 billion budget at HHS, Kennedy said that “money alone won’t fix this.”
“We have a whole generation of children who have lost faith in our country and their future,” Kennedy said. “Policy should reestablish hope for the future.”

The Trump administration — and Kennedy — have proposed to restructure HHS, including dismantling the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), cutting research funding and funding for addiction treatment and mental health care.
“All these changes are impacting people on the ground,” Pleus said. “People who are struggling with addiction can’t get help already and now they’re going to have an even harder time.”
The conference was sponsored by HMP Global, which provides continuing medical education.
Past speakers have included former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump spoke to the group in 2019 during his first term in office.
In addition to Kennedy, 2025 speakers included U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Tennessee senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Dr. Ralph Alvarado, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on April 20.CHELSEA — A 74-year-old Newbury man who shot and killed his 38-year-old daughter when she came to his home for a welfare check has been found insane and will not stand trial.James Perry is “not guilty by reason of insanity” following a psychiatric evaluation, according to a court order by Judge Daniel Richardson in Orange County Superior Court. Doctors concluded that Perry was “floridly psychotic with paranoid delusions and hallucinations” when he shot his daughter at point-blank range with a shotgun four years ago.Upon review of Perry’s psychiatric evaluation, the judge on April 4 said the conclusions met the defendant’s burden to show that at the time of shooting he “lacked the capacity” to understand the criminality of act and that Perry was suffering from a “paranoid and psychotic state.”Perry was charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and reckless endangerment for shooting his daughter, Karina Rheaume, on May 3, 2021, at his home on Deerfield Lane in Newbury.She had come to visit with cookies to check on his well-being.Rheaume’s boyfriend later called police to report that when he went to Perry’s home after she did not return from the visit that Perry had pointed a rifle at him and told him Rheaume was dead. He told the boyfriend “if he took one step closer, he’d be dead, too,” according to a police affidavit.Following his arrest, Perry was diagnosed with mental delusions lasting longer than a month but he nonetheless was deemed competent to stand trial, with a court-appointed psychiatrist concluding that he had the “capacity to assist … in the preparation of a defense.”Perry’s attorneys retained the right to hire their own forensic examiner to assess his mental health under an insanity defense. It was that second evaluation — with which both defense attorneys and prosecutors stipulated they agreed — that the judge relied upon in his ruling earlier this month.A self-employed carpenter, Perry’s family is well-known in the Newbury and Bradford area, including owning the Perry’s Oil Fuel and propane business.Perry never denied shooting his daughter, according to police and psychologists who evaluated him afterward.“In the months leading up to the shooting, (Perry) had become disconnected from reality and was occupying a paranoid and delusional space marked by hallucinations and disordered thinking,” Richardson wrote in his order.Although Perry’s psychiatric evaluation remains under seal, Richardson referenced eight “contributory factors” cited in the evaluation that led to his psychosis, including a long period of self-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, malnutrition, hearing loss, a prior psychotic event, cognitive decline and “information reverberations” created by watching TV news of political turmoil, including the U.S. Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.“The facts show that (Perry) acted out of a belief that he was being pursued for assassination by Seal Team 6 and his daughter was working in collusion to poison him and expose him to the assassins,” Richardson wrote.Perry’s documented state of mind at the time of the shooting met the burden of proof under Vermont law that he lacked “adequate capacity” to understand the criminality of his conduct or conform to the law, Richardson said.Perry has been held without bail at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield.The judge’s order notes that the forensic psychologist reported that Perry continued to exhibit psychotic “symptoms and issues” while in prison. Only recently, due to “several years of regular nutrition, the socialization that resulted from being lodged with other inmates and a regime of pain management have these mental illnesses begun to recede and (allow Perry) to connect with reality again.”Perry is next scheduled for a hospitalization hearing on Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court.The purpose of the hearing, which will be attended the county prosecutor, a representative from the state’s Department of Health, Vermont Legal Aid and the victim’s advocate, is to assess Perry’s current mental condition, treatment program and the appropriate place for him to reside.Depending on the outcome of that hearing — which typically comes in a follow-up order by the judge — Perry could face anything ranging from confinement to a mental health facility to release back into the community.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge rules Newbury man who killed daughter ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/orange-county-court-2-20240822.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

In this image, Lane joins with Blake Flanders, president of the Kansas Board of Regents, in a 2024 Kansas Reflector podcast interview. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The 2024 Kansas Legislature’s commitment to intervene on behalf of 33% of Kansas students not meeting fundamental levels of reading and to elevate literacy as an economic imperative throughout the state was celebrated as a bipartisan achievement.
There was $10 million in the state budget to develop instructional expertise through the Blueprint for Literacy. The idea was to enroll all Kansas elementary school teachers in graduate courses in the science of reading. Public and private universities would offer new classes to equip undergraduates with skills to implement a structured literacy curriculum useful to all students. The bottom-line objective: Significantly improve language arts skills of students in 3rd through 8th grades.
Senate Bill 438 roared through the Legislature on votes of 34-3 in the Senate and 98-22 in the House.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who signed the bill in April 2024, said the legislation placed Kansas at the “forefront of nationwide efforts to reform reading instruction.”
“By aligning the efforts of K-12 and higher education to train our educators in the science of reading, we intend to end the literacy divide for our students once and for all,” said Melanie Haas, a member of the Kansas State Board of Education responsible for K-12 schools.
Cynthia Lane, a member of the Kansas Board of Regents with oversight of state universities, said the Blueprint for Literacy would prove to be one of the most important bills enacted by the Legislature and governor in 2024. She felt so strongly about the cause that she took a job as the first director of the literacy initiative.
And then, as the 2025 legislative session unfolded, the Republican-led House budgeted $2 million in next year’s budget to the literacy program. The GOP-controlled Senate deleted that earmark by sweeping all House appropriations of interest earned on one-time federal funds. The state budget bill eventually passed with bipartisan support and signed by Kelly contained no new funding of Blueprint for Literacy.
That financial setback won’t close the book on Blueprint for Literacy — at least not now while the program remained in its infancy.
“The blueprint is not ending,” Lane said. “We’re not done.”
 In the beginning
Lane said several million dollars unspent from the original $10 million allocation would be relied upon to stick with plans to enroll certified teachers in a pair of three-credit-hour graduate courses on the science of reading. State funding was allocated to cover tuition costs of teachers in graduate-level courses and to provide each with a $500 stipend.
Kansas college students seeking degrees in education must enroll in two new courses in reading instruction. Those courses should be available this fall at seven public universities and at least five private colleges in Kansas.
She said the original plan to establish literacy centers of excellence at universities to bring instruction closer to teachers would be idled due to financial restraints.
The decision by the Legislature not to allocate additional resources for the Blueprint for Literacy was associated with skepticism the initiative had yet to show results or might not deliver on its promise, Lane said. Some critics of the Blueprint for Literacy also suggested it might be duplicative of a program developed by the Kansas State Department of Education with federal grants issued in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under the 2024 state law, the Blueprint for Literacy would take all elementary teachers through a graduate curriculum to attain a micro-credential in reading instruction by 2030. Student academic goals in Senate Bill 438 would have 90% of 3rd through 8th graders achieving Level 2 on the state’s four-level assessment scale. In addition, 50% of 3rd through 8th grade students would achieve Level 3 or Level 4 on the state assessment by 2033.
“It’s going to be hard to do when funding is removed and teachers can’t get trained,” said Lane, who was a superintendent of public schools in Kansas City, Kansas. “This is about our children. It’s about supporting our teachers.”
 ‘Easy chop’
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the $2 million offered by the House would have been derived from interest income on the state’s share of American Rescue Plan Act allotments from the federal government’s economic stimulus program in 2021.
Waymaster said the offer by the House was a reduction from earlier projections of what might be needed to operate Blueprint for Literacy, but would have made certain the initiative had financial support to continue on a limited basis.
He said advocates of the literacy program came to the Capitol to object to pulling the funding after less than one year of implementation. Critics of the Blueprint for Literacy countered the spending hadn’t turned the dial on student achievement in reading, he said.
“Senate pulled it out, because they had different ideas on what they wanted to do with the ARPA interest,” Waymaster said. “I also heard, around the halls, the results were not there. Some didn’t like it last year and, so, where we were at as far as looking at the budget, I think it was a easy chop.”
 ‘Eager, hungry, interested’
Molly Baumgardner, who championed the Blueprint for Literacy before leaving the Kansas Senate after not seeking reelection in 2024, said success of the initiative was vital to the future of Kansas school children as well as the state’s economy.
“We have too many kids in our state that can’t read,” Baumgardner said.
She said the $10 million originally invested in the program wasn’t available to organizers of the reading blueprint until July 1, 2024. A task force responsible for managing the initiative nevertheless meet program development deadlines set by the Legislature. Literacy instruction courses open to college students were in operation by August 2024 as mandated, she said. The state law had attached an unusual financial penalty for noncompliance — $1 million for three state universities and $500,000 for three regional state universities.
A Washburn University pilot program started in March to extend literacy-education instruction to teachers in Topeka proved popular enough to expand to three sections of 30 educators each, Baumgardner said.
“That’s how eager, hungry, interested our teachers in the classroom were,” she said. “There is tremendous interest.”
Baumgardner said the 2024 elections added members to the House and Senate unfamiliar with the reading blueprint. The compressed 2025 legislative session and changes to how the budget was prepared limited opportunities for literacy advocates to speak with lawmakers about how the state could benefit of additional funding, she said.
Baumgardner said she looked forward to sharing with the 2026 Legislature in January emerging evidence of how the Blueprint for Literacy influenced teachers and students.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6050104-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

The man who pleaded guilty to a mass shooting in 2022 in Highland Park that left seven people dead and prompted the passage of a ban on assault-style weapons in Illinois, has been sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences.

Robert Crimo III pleaded guilty on March 3, the day his trial was set to begin in Lake County, to 69 counts of murder and attempted murder stemming from that shooting. His attorneys informed Judge Victoria Rossetti that he wanted to change his plea just before what was to be the start of a three-week trial.

Crimo was accused of firing into a crowd of people from a rooftop in Highland Park during the city’s annual Independence Day parade using a semiautomatic rifle equipped with three 30-round magazines. He reportedly fired approximately 80 shots in about two minutes, killing seven people while injuring dozens more.

Rossetti on Thursday sentenced Crimo to consecutive life sentences for each of the seven victims who died. He also received 50 years for the 48 counts of attempted murder to which he pleaded guilty.

Victims of the shooting include Katherine Goldstein, 64; married couple Irina McCarthy, 35, and Kevin McCarthy, 37; Stephen Straus, 88; Jacki Sundheim, 63; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; and Eduardo Uvaldo, 69.

Survivors and witnesses shared stories with the court during the sentencing hearing on Wednesday and Thursday, which Crimo did not attend.

The Highland Park shooting in part prompted Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker to call for bans on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines at both the state and national levels. State lawmakers took up the issue during a lame duck session the following January and passed what is now called the Protect Illinois Communities Act.

It prohibits the purchase, sale, transfer or ownership of hundreds of types of firearms that it classifies as “assault weapons,” although people who owned such guns before the law’s enactment are allowed to keep them if they obtain a special endorsement on their Firearm Owner’s Identification card.

It also bans large-capacity magazines and various kinds of firearm attachments, including those that increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the rapid fire of a fully automatic weapon.

‘Venue shopping’ law upheld

The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a 2023 state law that says constitutional challenges to certain state actions may only be filed in Cook or Sangamon County circuit courts.

In a 6-1 ruling, the majority overturned a lower court ruling and said the law did not pose an unreasonable burden to the plaintiff in the case, a gun dealer in Madison County, and that the state had a legitimate reason for consolidating certain kinds of cases in certain counties.

The case involved Piasa Armory, located in East Alton, which filed a suit in 2023 challenging the state’s ban on assault-style weapons and large capacity magazines.

Although the case was filed in Madison County where the store is located, Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office filed a motion to move the case to Sangamon County under a new law the General Assembly had passed, and Gov. JB Pritzker had signed, earlier in 2023.

That law requires lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of a state statute, administrative rule or executive order be filed in the circuit court of either Cook County or Sangamon County.

Democrats pushed the legislation through the General Assembly in response to numerous lawsuits filed in multiple counties throughout the state challenging the assault weapons ban, as well as other cases that had been filed earlier challenging Pritzker’s executive orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The law was intended to prevent what lawyers sometimes refer to as “venue shopping,” or the practice of filing cases in specific jurisdictions where the political climate is such that judges and juries are more likely to side with one side of a case.

The law came in response to challenges to the state’s COVID-19 response, a state law ending cash bail and the state’s ban on assault weapons, among others.

These lawsuits – often filed in jurisdictions with sympathetic judges – became a way for some conservatives to make a name for themselves at the state level. Former Republican governor candidate and state Sen. Darren Bailey and former Republican attorney general candidate Thomas DeVore both backed high-profile lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state laws.

“We conclude that the State has some interest in consolidating actions in certain counties, especially in light of recent statewide litigation asserting duplicative constitutional claims,” Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the majority’s opinion.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahomans may get to vote to legalize sports betting after years of failed attempts to get it through the state Legislature.
A Senate panel on Thursday passed two sports betting bills, including one that potentially sets the stage for a public vote. 
The panel’s decision marked the first time sports betting legislation has advanced out of a Senate committee, said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City, the measures’ Senate author.
House Bill 1047 would allow tribes the ability to exclusively offer sports betting with a 10% fee to the state.  
It would require a supplement to the Model Tribal Gaming Compact which gives tribes the exclusive right to offer gaming.
Through the compacts, the state receives exclusivity fees in exchange for giving tribes the sole right to conduct certain types of Class III gaming, including slots, roulette and craps.
Coleman said the measure could bring in $14 million to $142 million to the state.
In Kansas, sports betting last year brought in $165 million in revenue, he said. Kansas Lottery records show the state received about 10% of the total.
The measure passed the Senate Business and Commerce Committee by a vote of 8-1.
A companion measure, House Bill 1101, also passed by a vote of 6-3.
If the first fails or is vetoed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, then House Bill 1101 would send the issue to a vote of the people, Coleman said.
Stitt has said he would not support a sports betting bill that gives exclusivity to the tribes and indicated he would veto any measures.
“This procedure was used in 2003 when members did not want to take a vote on the lottery,” Coleman said.
The Oklahoma Legislature in 2003 put two state questions on the ballot, 707 and 706, to create the lottery. Both passed. 
The Oklahoma Lottery began settling tickets in 2005.
It has contributed more than $1.3 billion to education.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he is not a big fan of gambling, but Oklahomans are already engaging in sports betting.
“And since it is happening anyway, we should figure out a way to put out the regulatory framework and do it in a way that makes sense, working with our tribal partners,” Hilbert said.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) In the wake of a resident death caused by an untreated bed sore, an Iowa nursing home is continuing to accrue daily fines for failing to comply with federal regulations.
So far, those fines total more than $139,707, with an additional $2,200 in fines added each day the home remains out of compliance, according to state and federal regulators.
State inspection records show that in January, the staff at Sanford Senior Care in Sheldon, a 70-bed nursing home affiliated with the Sanford Medical Center, found that a male resident of the home had developed a reddened area on his coccyx, or tailbone. The staff failed to assess and treat the situation or notify the man’s family or physician — even after it developed into an open sore in February, according to inspectors.
The resident died on March 6. According to state inspectors, the immediate cause of death was MRSA cellulitis — a dangerous skin infection that stems from staph bacteria — caused by the open wound.

“There was bloody skin on both sides of the buttocks and continuing down it looked like hamburger,” a nurse aide reportedly told inspectors. The facility’s director of nursing allegedly informed inspectors that certain employees were disciplined as a result of the death, adding, “We are trying to do everything possible to prevent this from occurring again.”
Administrator Richard Nordahl referred all questions on the matter to Sanford Health, which then issued a written statement, attributed to Nordahl, that said, “Due to privacy laws, we are unable to provide any comment on this inquiry.”
No state fines were imposed as a result of the death, although the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website indicated a federal fine of some sort was imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
When asked, DIAL initially declined to disclose any information about the fine and referred the Iowa Capital Dispatch to CMS. A CMS spokesman then referred the Capital Dispatch back to DIAL. On Tuesday, a DIAL spokesman said the state agency had conferred with CMS and had obtained the federal agency’s “permission” to release the information.
DIAL now says that after it was determined that regulatory violations had placed residents of the home in immediate jeopardy, a fine of $12,130 per day was imposed for the six days the jeopardy existed. The penalty totaled $72,780, but was reduced 35% by CMS, to $47,307, presumably because the home didn’t appeal the fine.
After the immediate-jeopardy situation was resolved, other issues still remained and so the daily fines continued but at the rate of $2,220 per day beginning March 12, 2025, according to DIAL. That particular fine will continue to accrue, DIAL says, until the facility “has made the necessary corrections to achieve substantial compliance” with regulations.
As of Tuesday, April 22, that $2,200 daily fine would have totaled $92,400. Combined, the two federal fines totaled $139,707 as of that date — although the second set of daily fines, like the first, remains subject to a 35% reduction if the home chooses to forgo an appeal.
On CMS’ five-star quality scale, the Sheldon facility currently has a one-star overall rating — the lowest possible score.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DIAL-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

Liz Jacob, an attorney at the Sugan Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement on behalf of the TAHRIR Coalition, a pro-Palestinian group at the University of Michigan, that Nessel is aligning herself with the administration of President Donald Trump “to intimidate protestors and attack their constitutional right to freedom of speech.”
“Dana Nessel frames herself as a democratic bulwark against the Trump Administration, yet has demonstrated continuous collaboration with Trump’s federal government to repress the popular movement for Palestinian liberation,” Jacob said. “Nessel’s irresponsible conduct has already endangered Michigan residents, putting them in the crosshairs of the Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant and anti-democratic assaults.”
No charges have yet been filed as part of the investigation, which remains ongoing.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two high-ranking state government officials are leaving to serve in the federal Department of Homeland Security under former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, and Noem’s successor has chosen a replacement for one of them.
State Department of Tribal Relations Secretary David Flute will serve as senior tribal adviser on Indian affairs for Noem, who now leads Homeland Security. Bureau of Information and Technology Commissioner Madhu Gottumukkala will serve as the deputy director of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 
Gov. Larry Rhoden said the two played key roles in state government, saying they’ll “add tremendous value” to the federal department.
Flute is an enrolled member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and served as tribal chairman before he was appointed tribal relations secretary by Noem in 2018. The department works to foster relationships with the nine tribal nations in the state. 
Algin Young, who was appointed as the state’s tribal law enforcement liaison last year, will assume the role of secretary for the Department of Tribal Relations on Friday.

Young served in the Marines before working in law enforcement for 23 years with the Oglala Sioux Tribe. He was appointed to the liaison position by Noem, who alleged he “found himself without a job” for speaking up about drug cartels on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
Young said he’s keen to build relationships between South Dakota and tribal communities.
“As Governor Rhoden so often says, we must focus on turning challenges into opportunities,” Young said in a news release.
The current salary for the tribal relations job is $138,911.98.
Gottumukkala will remain BIT commissioner until May 16. The Dakota State University graduate was appointed to the position in September after working with Sanford Health. The bureau manages information and technology-related needs in state government.
“I look forward to continuing to protect and strengthen the nation’s digital and physical infrastructure at a time when it matters most,” Gottumukkala said in the release.
Interested applicants for the commissioner position can apply online. The job’s current salary is $184,805.29.

Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he plans to call a special legislative session to address the rising costs of state employee health insurance coverage. 
Speaking during a press conference Wednesday, Morrisey said he’d bring lawmakers back to Charleston to tackle issues including the Public Employees Insurance Agency. 
“That’s important. I thought that would be best for a special session, to be honest,” Morrisey said. “Because you can bring everyone. You can focus it. It’s a complicated issue. We want to get it right. 
“That was kicked down the road for many, many years,” the governor said. “I don’t intend to kick it down the road. We have to bring everyone together, all the stakeholders: listen, learn and then you’ll be seeing some activity.”
Morrisey’s news conference, which he held in Wheeling, marked his first 100 days in office. 
More than 200,000 state employees and thousands of local government workers rely on PEIA for their health insurance. 
Beginning in July, PEIA premiums are increasing by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs are also increasing. The agency will also raise premiums by 12% for retirees.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care, particularly inflation for prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes, are a major driver of the rate increases.
Following the regular session, union leaders reiterated calls that the program be stabilized.
“It’s a good benefit. We need to keep it at a good benefit,” West Virginia ALF-CIO president Josh Sword told West Virginia Watch. “We also know that public sector workers generally make less than those in the private sector, and one of the reasons that it’s attractive, therefore, to work in the public sector is because you’ve generally had access to PEIA, which is a good health care benefit for the employee and their family. 
“You take that away, or you destroy a pretty good benefit program so that it is not what it used to be, then you’ve lost that incentive to attract and retain qualified individuals in the public sector,” he said. 
This year’s state budget included $64 million more in spending for PEIA than last year’s budget. The appropriation is in line with the funding Morrisey level requested for the agency, according to a spokeswoman for the Senate. 
Senate president Randy Smith and House of Delegates Speaker Roger Hanshaw were not available for comment on Thursday. Senate communications director Jacque Bland said Smith would not be surprised by the governor’s remarks indicating a special session, which Morrisey has talked about before. 
Ann Ali, communications director and deputy chief of staff for the House of Delegates, said Hanshaw’s reaction would likely depend on what specific proposals the governor has. Morrisey did not outline any specific ideas for PEIA during his press conference Wednesday.  
“Extraordinary sessions for various reasons have become commonplace, but Speaker Hanshaw’s response when asked for potential reaction or feedback to any general proposal from the previous governor was usually that the House would have to see the bill(s) for how that proposal would be structured,” Ali said. 
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said lawmakers need to go beyond allocating money to PEIA and consider structural changes. He said finding solutions should involve bringing various stakeholders together.
“We need to look at serious, what I would call long-term structural enhancements to the program to make sure that the promise that we made state workers many, many moons ago isn’t eroded, and we follow through on that,” Hornbuckle said. “That’s very important to me, from a state perspective.”
He added that he would have preferred that time during the regular session were dedicated to PEIA and not to vaccine exemption bills and legislation ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“The priorities of the supermajority Republicans are not in line with everyday West Virginians,” he said.

Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Senate ethics committee on Thursday recommended that Senate President Bobby Joe Champion in the future disclose “any appearance of a potential conflict of interest” to Senate committees when he chief authors a bill, following Reformer reporting that he’d spearheaded a lucrative legislative grant for a legal client.
Champion requested an advisory opinion from the Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct after the Reformer reported that Champion in 2023 spearheaded a $3 million grant to violence prevention nonprofit 21 Days of Peace, run by north Minneapolis Rev. Jerry McAfee, but didn’t disclose that McAfee was his legal client. Champion says he did the work pro bono.
The committee also found that Champion had no financial conflict of interest when he advocated for an additional $1 million in funding for 21 Days of Peace earlier this year.
Champion has insisted that because his legal work for McAfee was pro-bono and concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session, he didn’t need to disclose it.
The committee Thursday made no findings of Champion’s ethical conduct for his spearheading of the $3 million grant to McAfee’s group in 2023.
The ruling is unenforceable. Under Minnesota law, legislative conflicts of interest are narrowly defined and only exist when the official does something to benefit themselves financially. Minnesota’s part-time Legislature creates many opportunities for conflicts of interest, as most lawmakers have another job.
In a final written statement to the ethics committee, Champion said recent media coverage about him was an attack on his integrity.
“We have had media outlets go from saying there was a conflict of interest requiring disclosure without reading the conflict-of-interest statute,” Champion wrote. “Unfortunately, there has been loose use of facts that attempts to erode Senator Champion’s integrity.”
After the hearing Thursday, Champion criticized reporting about his connections to McAfee.
“I am always a high integrity person,” Champion said. “I’ve been a committed community person … I hope that when you all are reporting these things that you take a different approach.”
He disputed the characterizations of the $3 million grant to 21 Days of Peace.
“You report it as if there’s a direct appropriation that is presented and then we as legislators sign a check,” Champion chided reporters. “That’s unfair and that’s untrue.”
McAfee received funding through the practice of legislatively named grants, meaning lawmakers directly named the nonprofit in legislation. That means the nonprofit doesn’t have to go through an onerous bidding competition run by a state agency. The Office of Legislative Auditor has repeatedly found that agencies failed to provide adequate oversight for these legislatively named grants compared to competitive grants. The OLA has recommended lawmakers refrain from allocating funds through legislatively named grants since 2007.
Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, who chairs the ethics subcommittee, said that the committee’s guidance could be applicable for all senators, not solely Champion.
“If it’s of interest to the committee for us to reveal that we did some volunteer work, or we served on a board in the past, I think that’s a very positive thing,” Pappas said.
Senate Republicans Thursday attempted to remove Champion as Senate president, but Democrats moved the motion to the Senate Rules Committee for further consideration.
Senate Republicans also filed an ethics complaint against Champion, and the ethics subcommittee will meet on May 5 to discuss it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250422_0180-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Stadnard)Lawmakers in the Washington House and Senate have struck an agreement to provide up to six weeks of unemployment insurance for striking workers.
Both chambers approved Senate Bill 5041 this year to open the safety net program to striking workers, but they set different limits for the amount of time people could receive benefits. The Senate approved a 12-week limit, the House four weeks. 
Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, said the six-week compromise hits a “sweet spot,” addressing concerns from businesses while leveling the playing field for low-wage workers. 
Labor unions and Democratic lawmakers have pressed for the bill, arguing the benefits will help striking workers afford necessities such as food and rent when negotiating for better wages and working conditions. 
When the bill passed the Senate last month, an amendment that would have restricted unemployment benefits to four weeks failed by one vote. Then, in mid-April, the House amended the bill ahead of a floor vote to add the four-week limit. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, has not publicly taken a position on the bill.
Under the bill, workers would become eligible for unemployment benefits on the second Sunday after a strike begins, plus a one-week waiting period. Typically, unemployment insurance is offered for up to 26 weeks a year. 
If a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law, benefits would have to be repaid. 
Workers affected by employer-initiated lockouts would also be eligible for the benefits. Labor advocates point to lockouts as a tactic businesses can use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
New Jersey and New York are the only states that provide unemployment insurance for striking workers.
Republicans opposed the bill. 
They, along with business groups, argue it could incentivize workers to strike and result in higher costs for businesses that could spill over onto employers not involved in labor disputes.
“If employers aren’t healthy, you don’t have workers and when we don’t have healthy employers, we’re not going to have a healthy economy,” said Rep. Suzanne Schmidt, R-Spokane Valley. 
The bill would also require the state’s Employment Security Department to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the prevalence of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund. 
If passed, the bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is set to expire Dec. 31, 2035. 
Both chambers have to wait 24 hours before putting the bill up for a vote, which means it could gain final approval from the Legislature as early as Friday.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)New legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Kelly Armstrong aims to protect patients from care-delaying snags in the health insurance prior authorization process.
Prior authorization refers to when someone must obtain approval from their insurance company before they can undergo a procedure, obtain medication or receive some other health service.
The process allows insurance companies to review whether the service or medication is necessary for the patient. Insurers say prior authorization helps control costs and make sure that patients are getting the best care they can.
But some doctors, patients and advocates say the process can be misused in a way that prevents people from accessing necessary services, or that leaves patients and hospitals to foot the bill for expensive treatments.
Insulin caps bill headed to North Dakota governor

Susan Finneman, a Bismarck resident who testified in favor of the bill, said 10 years ago her insurance company refused to authorize medical scans needed to treat her spine infection, leading her to put off health care and for the infection to fester.
She ultimately needed spinal reconstruction surgery — which she said her insurance company took so long to authorize that she nearly had to reschedule the procedure. 
Finneman said she had to personally call the highest-ranking doctor working at her insurance company to get the surgery approved.
“It’s not right that people have to figure out how to navigate it on their own,” she said at a Wednesday ceremonial signing of Senate Bill 2280. 
The new law sets guidelines for how insurance companies must handle the prior authorization process, including mandatory deadlines for responding to authorization requests and requirements that denials are reviewed by medical professionals. 
The law does not cover all state-regulated insurance markets, according to testimony from Sanford Health. State employee health insurance plans, for example, are excluded.
Other sections direct insurance companies to publicize information about how its prior authorization process works, and to give advance notice to patients and health care providers when the company plans to change this process.
Andrew Askew, vice president of public policy for Essentia Health, said in testimony on the bill most large insurers in North Dakota don’t cause issues with their prior authorization procedures. 
But that’s not the case with every company, he said.
“There’s a lot of insurance companies that are completely unreasonable,” Askew said.
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

In 2024 survey results published by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors reported the prior authorization process had resulted in care delays to patients that posed significant health risks.
Doctors occasionally must provide an emergency procedure on short notice without time to send a request to an insurance company. The prior authorization process in those instances must happen retroactively. 
Askew said in some cases, the insurance companies don’t give medical providers enough time to send this retroactive claim and to supply the backup documentation showing the procedure was necessary.
When prior authorization cannot be obtained after a procedure is provided, the patient or hospital may be forced to cover the full cost, he said.
“That’s extremely burdensome for hospitals that are trying to make a margin, trying to get patients care when they need it,” Askew said.
The new law says that prior authorization may not be required for a patient to receive emergency health care. It also says patients and health care providers have at least two business days after an emergency procedure to notify insurance.
North Dakota House approves change to state health insurance plan

Insurance companies must also ensure that when they deny health care to someone, that decision is made by a medical doctor or pharmacist, the statute states.
The law also mandates that appeals to prior authorization decisions are reviewed by medical doctors.
In both cases, the medical professionals must have active, specialized experience in the field of medicine relevant to the health service in question.
Several other provisions in the law are intended to prevent patients from being abruptly cut off from their health care.
For example, the law states that if an insurance company changes its prior authorization coverage requirements for a medication or health care service, the change generally may not impact those receiving the medication or service until those patients’ insurance plans turn over. 
If an insurance company violates the requirements outlined in the law, any health care services under prior authorization review are automatically granted, it states.
A prior authorization decision does not determine whether the insurance will cover something. A patient can be granted pre-authorization for a procedure but then still have to pay for part or all of it, in other words.
Some insurers testified in opposition to the law.
Megan Hruby of Blue Cross Blue Shield testified that prior authorization only impacts a small number of procedures, and said the requirements would create more bureaucratic barriers, not remove them.
She said the law would also increase insurance costs for taxpayers.
Hruby noted that the Legislature’s Health Care Committee studied prior authorization during the 2023-2025 interim session and didn’t end up making any policy recommendations.
The law will take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
It also requires that covered insurance companies report annual data to the state related to prior authorizations, including the number of approvals and denials, and the reason requests were denied.
The statute directs the Legislature to consider two prior authorization-related studies during the interim legislative session.
The first will study prior authorization requirements under state employee health insurance, and how those requirements impact patients and health care costs. The study would the require insurance plans to submit data by July 1 to the North Dakota Insurance Commissioner detailing the previous years worth of prior authorization requests granted, denied and appealed. The data would also have to include why any requests were denied, and how many denials were reversed.
The second study tasks legislators to research ways to send prior authorization requests electronically, as opposed to through the mail.
Any policy recommendations to come out of the studies will be forwarded to lawmakers to consider for the 2027-2029 legislative session.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)When he was in second grade, Krystal Emerson’s son was physically restrained by a staff member or put in a small, isolated room at least 18 times over seven months during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary Middle School. He no longer attends school in person after the trauma of those experiences deepened his anxiety and emotional dysregulation, Emerson told Maine lawmakers during a public hearing on Wednesday. 
A mother of five, Emerson has been speaking out for months against the practices of restraint and seclusion, which can include immobilizing students, dragging them down hallways, and confining them in closet-sized rooms. These measures remain legal in Maine, but under specific conditions.
But four years after the state passed a law limiting their use, some educators and administrators are now pushing to loosen those restrictions in order to give staff more flexibility to address what appears to be an increase in student behavioral crises. 
Encouraging lawmakers to reject a proposal that would lower the legal threshold for restraint and seclusion, Emerson told members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee that her son is still reeling from his experiences. Even driving past the school building or hearing it mentioned visibly unsettles him.
“It broke me, and it broke him,” she said.
Districts, teachers back changes to law
The proposal before the Legislature, LD 1248 introduced by Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York), would make several changes to the text of a state law passed in 2021. 
For example, in the section outlining when a restraint may be used, the bill would change the threat level from “imminent danger of serious physical injury” to “imminent danger of injury.” 
Research suggests state not doing enough to help Maine districts manage student behavior

It also removes the word “voluntary” when describing how staff can move a student. Under the proposal, involuntary movement of a student would no longer count as a physical restraint that would need to be reported, according to Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of Special Education Programs at the University of New England, who said she was drawing from her experience as a substitute teacher in Portland-area schools in testifying against the bill.
Proponents, which included several teachers, administrators, and the Maine Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, framed the bill as a minor but necessary change that will provide, as Sargent put it, “clarity and flexibility for educators.”
Teachers and support staff “are under siege from violent, out of control students,” said Rep. Will Tuell, (R-East Machias), who co-sponsored the bipartisan bill.
One district leading the push is MSAD 11 in the Gardiner area, whose administrators met with lawmakers to ask for the more flexible language, arguing it would give them more tools to be able to handle increasingly frequent violent outbursts. 
After consulting with attorneys from Drummond Woodsum, MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins told Maine Morning Star she was concerned by their interpretation of the statute, which they took to mean that school staff could only restrain a student if they are about to cause harm dire enough to send someone to the hospital. 
During the hearing, lawyers from Disability Rights Maine and Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based national nonprofit working to reduce restraints and seclusions, argued that’s an extreme interpretation of the law.
“That is a striking interpretation. It is not one that I have seen case law support, especially in Maine,” Disability Rights Maine staff attorney Jeanette Plourde told the committee.
“I have not seen that interpretation being followed by schools, by the mere virtue of the fact that we continue to receive calls from parents of children…who have been subjected to restraint and seclusion,” she added.
Ellsworth Superintendent Amy Boles declined to comment on Emerson’s testimony but said she believes relaxing the statute’s language will help protect her staff.
“Our staff are getting beat up on the daily now, and it is getting harder and harder to find people that are willing to put themselves at risk,” she said in an interview with Maine Morning Star. “Changing the language from ‘serious physical,’ which is very narrow, to a broader ‘imminent danger,’ I believe we’re supportive of, because we have to protect our staff.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, told the committee that the key to reducing violent events is providing school staff with more training to deescalate those behaviors.
A recent report released by the Maine Policy Research Institute about student behavior said fewer than half of the 3,400 educators surveyed reported receiving classroom management training. 
“It’s very difficult for me to understand why more restraint and seclusion would lead to more safety for either party,” Jones said. “But I’ve heard the pleas from the schools, saying we need something. And I’m saying that something doesn’t have to be more force. It can be more training.”

Former Minneapolis DFL vice chair, prolific X poster and business owner Mike Norton is considering a run for the south metro seat held by U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, Norton said Thursday. 
Craig, who has represented Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District since 2019, has been signaling a run for governor or the Senate seat held by Sen. Tina Smith, who is retiring at the end of her term. Craig has not yet officially announced anything but has said she’d make her intentions known this month and is in the middle of touring Minnesota congressional districts that aren’t her own.
She appeared to stop accepting donations on her CD-2 fundraising page this week despite her reputation as a relentless fundraiser, and a fundraising page for a Senate run appeared to be briefly live Thursday morning before donations were turned off, according to a Minnesota DFL activist who posted it to X.
“Congresswoman Craig has said that she will make an announcement by the end of April about her intentions for 2026,” a spokesperson for Craig said.
  A webpage hosted by ActBlue, Democrats’ fundraising website, displays “Fundraiser: Angie Craig, MN-Sen,” though the fundraiser is not accepting donations.
Since the district’s longtime Republican Rep. John Kline announced his retirement ahead of the 2016 election, the 2nd District has been purple. Craig lost in 2016 before winning narrowly in the Democratic wave year of 2018 and adding to her margins of victory ever since. 
Redistricting following the 2020 census made the district slightly bluer, but even in a good year for Republicans, Craig won by more than 13 percentage points in 2024 after staking her claim to traditionally GOP issues like border security and support for law enforcement.
Norton said the district’s changing demographics mean the area is now more blue than purple — and that’s why he thinks he’d have a good chance of winning despite more a more progressive agenda than Craig. He wants to legalize marijuana at the federal level, eliminate daylight saving time and expand public school programming, including making public schools year-round.
Norton isn’t a resident of the district, but the U.S. Constitution only requires residency in the state of Minnesota to be elected to Congress. Other candidates would surely accuse him of carpetbagging were he to continue to live in Minneapolis.
“I’m not going to pull a Curtis Johnson,” Norton said when asked about his residency, referring to the DFL candidate for the state Legislature who was ruled ineligible for office last year because he didn’t live in the district. “I think what matters to CD-2 constituents is that they’re represented by somebody that can be effective in Congress — and I think I would be highly effective in Congress.”
Norton has been at times a vocal critic of his own party, and resigned from his post as vice chair of the Minneapolis DFL in 2023, citing concerns with the caucus and convention process.
Norton could face a crowded Democratic-Farmer-Labor field. A website touting the congressional candidacy of state Sen. Matt Klein was briefly up recently before it was taken down. State Sen. Erin Maye Quade could also be up for contention, should Craig run for higher office.
Norton is the founder of a logistics company that has twice been named one of the 50 fastest growing privately-held firms in Minnesota. He’s also something of an internet celebrity for promoting Minneapolis, capturing scenes of the City of Lakes — always referred to as “lovely” in his X posts — while riding his bike. He’s attracted legions of anti-Minneapolis trolls but has also sought to build bridges, including a bike ride with conservative state Rep. Walter Hudson, R-Albertville. 
If Craig opts to run for Senate, she will face a tough primary against one of the state’s other top Democrats in Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who presents a more progressive option for voters who are wary of Craig’s moderation. 
Ahead of any expected Craig announcement, Flanagan released a list of endorsements from state legislators in Craig’s district, including DFL state Sens. Lindsey Port and Erin Maye Quade, and Reps. Kristi Pursell, Jess Hanson and Mary Frances Clardy.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-24-at-2.35.18 PM-1024x610.png,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Some former inmates said they fixed his personal vehicles. One even said she gave his wife back massages.
Read their answers below and read the full story here.
Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: Was there any point in your investigation when you felt concerned for your personal safety? Did any of the former inmates express concern about their safety as a consequence of sharing their stories?
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Almost every single former inmate we spoke to (except the few who were happy to go on the record about their positive experiences) were worried about their safety and preferred to remain anonymous. Especially those who still live in Rankin County. Keep in mind that the law is not kind to repeat or habitual offenders of any kind, and all of these folks had at least one felony on their record, making them very worried about getting in any sort of trouble again. 
We definitely noticed a culture of fear. Multiple male former trusties told us they try their best to stay out of Rankin County at all times. 
For us, it wasn’t so bad. I will say it was a difficult story to report, especially as the press is increasingly perceived and treated with animosity by public authorities that ought to be transparent and answerable to the people. But we made every effort to be safe, responsible, and most importantly fair to the subjects of our reporting. It definitely helps to know that you’re doing everything in your power to dot your i’s and cross your t’s.  

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
More than one male former trusty said they avoid Rankin County because they’re concerned officers will find any reason to pull them over – if they’re going 10 over the speed limit on the highway, for example. I remember when we asked one former trusty if he’d be willing to have his hands photographed for the story – keeping him anonymous, but still featuring a photo of him – he suddenly sounded so scared, and it really hit home for me the fear of retaliation that some former inmates feel, often after having really horrific experiences in the jail. Sometimes I imagine an alternate reality where it would be safe for them to openly tell their full stories – everything they’ve been through, how much they’ve grown – alongside their photos.

Q: In your article, there was a quote from one of the supervisors which claimed that they had no authority over the Sheriff’s budgets.
In your reporting for this story, were you able to review the specific budget documents, invoices, purchase orders etc? If so, whose name was on these documents as signing off on them being approved purchases? Is there any evidence that these purchases were made with seized drug money? If so, what would the evidence be for that?
Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
I wish I had a better answer to this question! We had really, really hoped to be able to sit down with members of the Board of Supervisors and talk about the purchasing process, who from the Board of Supervisors has to approve what and when, and whether there’s a review process of sheriff’s department purchases after money has been budgeted for the department. 
In short, the documents we have don’t show anyone in particular signing off on purchases. And yes, there is clear evidence that some of the purchases – such as the skid steer that Sheriff Bailey allegedly stored on his mother’s farm that was used to clear land – were made with seized drug money. We know that because the sheriff’s department’s budgeted funds are in a different “pot” of money from seized drug money. We had to request the documents separately, and some of the drug seizure purchases are explicitly labeled as such in the description column for the purchase. We also confirmed about the skid steer with a source who’s a former deputy.
And we tried hard to talk with supervisors, to no avail. When Mukta emailed one of the supervisors asking for an interview, the sheriff’s department’s lawyer replied to the email, saying no one from the county would talk with us. We showed up in person to the supervisors’ office, called and even asked the supervisors for an interview during a monthly BoS meeting. The answer was always the same.

Q: Do you think it will be more difficult in the current political climate to hold Bailey accountable for his misuse of actual people?
We seem to be okay with some pretty questionable behaviors from government officials, and Bailey is still sheriff after several other heinous allegations have been made public.
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Don’t mean for this to sound like a cop-out (no pun intended) but it seems like only time will tell. You are correct that it has gotten way more difficult to hold law enforcement accountable as the Department of Justice under this administration has deprioritized police reform. But the response this story received from within the Rankin County community was something that none of us had expected. People seem really, really angry. And sometimes, that’s the best part of local reporting: even if it doesn’t trigger reform at the very top, it can change minds within the community, and that can sometimes end up being even more impactful. 

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
Quite possibly. There’s what’s happening at the federal level. The state auditor’s office has opened an investigation into the allegations from our story, but that office can’t prosecute. In addition to the allegations that the sheriff used inmates to work on the chicken farm, there are also the allegations that he used county property and resources, such as gravel and the skid steer, for his personal benefit. It’s possible that some of those allegations are more actionable from a legal standpoint than others, but I can’t really say. Time will tell!

Q: Were there ever reports of inmates being injured or ill after working for them, especially at the chicken farm? I cannot imagine and PPE being used and chicken barn dust is no joke. As an aside, it’s sad that the only thing the female inmates seem to be allowed to do is clean and office work. Did they ever produce the rules of the program for men or disciplinary policies for either sex? I don’t understand how you can have such a program without thoroughly planned out and documented policies.
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
That is a GREAT question and something we will definitely start looking into. I will say, chicken farm-related  injuries and illnesses didn’t come up while we were reporting for these stories, but we did certainly hear that it was not pleasant work at all. It involved, like Christian Dedmon said in that text to his then-wife, being “covered in chicken shit.” Which I personally have not experienced before but does not sound fun. 
About the female inmates being relegated to cleaning (with the occasional exception of secretarial work) – man, we noticed that too! It was interesting because you would think at least partially, the idea behind working in jail would be to build skills for post-release life. And while the men had the opportunity to practice a bunch of different trades – which some of them continue to do in the “free world,” such as electric work and auto repair – some female trusties who started working after jail are doing just that: cleaning. Nothing wrong with cleaning, obviously, but it is undeniably very gendered work. 

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
Seconding that this is an awesome question. I can’t speak directly to the availability of PPE on the farm, but I was struck by how former trusties we spoke with sort of shrugged off the nastiness and difficulty of the annual cleanout. I can’t speak for them, but I think it points to the thorniness of trusties’ relationships with sheriff’s department officials, and how trusty work – even work that (allegedly) broke the law – could be a survival strategy for inmates. I think it can be true that trusties were allegedly being used for the sheriff’s benefit AND that being one of the most trusted trusties, who was allowed to work outside the jail under looser supervision, was desirable. One of our sources said something like, even when you’re in jail, there’s some degree of choice. Another source talked about wanting to impress the sheriff to become a “blue suit” – the highest rank of male trusties – and said that part of the reason he wanted this was that it could make his life in the jail easier. 
And I hear you about the cleaning. If I were a trusty, I would want to learn how to fix cars!

Q: Is it “trustees” or “trusties”?
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Thank you so much for this question – so many people responded to the story correcting this spelling and it’s great to get to clear up the confusion once and for all. 
In a nutshell: it’s “trusties,” with “trusty” being the singular form, in the context of inmates. Basically it means trustworthy. Think, “I drove my trusty car!” But it is very confusing, because the word “trustees” also has a similar meaning. We were thrown off by this too!!

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
This is a question a lot of people have had, and it’s a good one! Everyone we talked with says “trustees” (with the emphasis on the second syllable). So in people’s everyday speech, it’s absolutely “trustees.” And I think there’s kind of an interesting slippage between the formal, Merriam-Webster spelling – “trusties” – and how it’s pronounced, since in the financial world, “trustees” are entrusted with valuable assets. And trusties are, too. We went with the dictionary spelling because of our organization’s style guidelines.

Q: How long has this practice been ongoing in Rankin County? Did any other sheriff predecessor know or take part in it?
Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
We focused on Sheriff Bailey’s time in office, so I can’t speak definitively on what happened before. We know that the trusty system is old, in Rankin County and across the state. After civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was arrested in June 1963 for riding in the “white” section of a Greyhound bus in Winona, Montgomery County jailers ordered two Black trusties to torture her. In 1972, a federal court found that at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, the use of armed “trusty shooters” to oversee inmates’ work in the fields resulted in dozens of inmates suffering gunshot wounds and beatings. And incarcerated farm labor itself – for instance, at Parchman Farm – was a successor to the convict leasing system, which sought to address labor shortages and reinforced white supremacy after the end of the Civil War.

Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Also, former Simpson County Sheriff Lloyd “Goon” Jones, someone Sheriff Bailey considered a mentor, was killed when he was shot along with a jail trusty in his front yard.

Q: Have you faced threats of retaliation?
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Words like “defamatory” have certainly been thrown around, but besides that, not really. It’s our sources we’re more concerned about – many of them still have to live in Rankin County and for that reason were really scared to speak up. 

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
Luckily, no. Aside from the “defamatory” language, there’s just been unpleasantness and some foot-dragging on our public record requests. I worry about our sources, though! I have such respect for them for speaking out at risk to themselves.

Q: In this investigation did you find any additional info on Rankin County’s “goon squad”? (Not sure if that’s super relevant here)
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: We’re working on it. Our larger team, which includes our incredible colleagues Nate Rosenfield, Brian Howey and Jerry Mitchell are currently continuing reporting on the Goon Squad. Brian & Nate’s work in 2023 showed us that the Goon Squad wasn’t limited to the 6 officers who got sentenced in the Jenkins & Parker case, and that it was going on well beyond those two incidents, for nearly two decades. Many people told us that it was an open secret. Which means that story is far from over!

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
This is a really important point. The torture and abuse that have come to light through our colleagues’ Goon Squad reporting wasn’t limited to the officers who are in prison. We can’t say much here at this point, but there’s a lot more work to do!",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/24090640/ama-4-17-25-ask-steph-quinn-and-mukta-joshi-about-their-v0-1oxrk40xz7ve1.webp,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, takes a phone call before the start of the Rhode Island Senate's floor session on April 1, 2025. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Providence Democratic Sen. Frank Ciccone III says he’s seeking the Senate president spot as a way to pay tribute to his friend and “brother,” the late Sen. President Dominick Ruggerio.
Other senators say Senate Majority Leader Val Lawson is drumming up votes for her own presidential bid, with Ciccone as her No. 2. And Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, isn’t talking.
Amid much confusion and closed-door conversations, one thing is clear: The forthcoming leadership contest has deepened longstanding tensions between progressive and conservative Rhode Island Democrats.
Progressive group Indivisible Rhode Island is publicly urging residents to tell their state senator not to support a ticket that includes Ciccone in either leadership role, referring to Ciccone as “Trump Lite” in a post on BlueSky.
Meanwhile, even senators who support Lawson are reluctant to vote for her if she aligns herself with Ciccone due to his voting history opposing abortion rights, gun restrictions, and gay marriage.
Another option: Sen. Ryan Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat who already gathered the backing of one-third of Senate Democrats when he unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio for the president spot during the party’s November caucus. Pearson confirmed his candidacy Thursday, but declined to comment when asked about Lawson and Ciccone.
“This is a time for us to bring the Senate together and have us work as a unified team for the people of Rhode Island,” Pearson said in a text message Thursday. “I am seeking my colleagues’ support based on my past record working with each of them as Finance Chair and Majority leader, delivering on their priorities and meeting the diverse needs of their districts.”
Ciccone also said he wants to bring harmony to a divided chamber. That’s what prompted him to start calling lawmakers for support on April 21, following Ruggerio’s death earlier that day.
“I even feel bad talking about this to you right now,” Ciccone, 77, said Thursday morning. “I don’t think we should do anything, make any statements, cut any deals, go public until after the funeral.”
Ruggerio’s funeral Mass will be celebrated on Monday, April 28. The Senate has been on hiatus since his death, but is expected to reconvene following his funeral, at which time a simple majority of the sitting 37 senators will vote for a new president.

– Sen. Frank Ciccone III, a Providence Democrat, regarding Senate leadership elections 


There’s little daylight between Pearson and Lawson on policy issues: Both support stronger reproductive rights and gun restrictions, champion education issues and want to strengthen the state’s health care landscape. But Ciccone, first elected in 2002, represents a much different brand of Democrat, making his alliance with Lawson surprising, and potentially, damaging to her candidacy.
“I like Val, and would absolutely support her on the leadership team,” said Sen. Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat. Mack is the youngest, and one of the most progressive members of the chamber.
Referring to Ciccone, Mack continued, “But I cannot stand behind someone who is, in this state of the world, not going to give us a firm commitment to what 75% of Rhode Islanders believe we need: an assault-weapons ban.”

Gun rights under fire 
Ciccone is a licensed federal firearms dealer and gun rights supporter with an “A” rating by the National Rifle Association. He sells guns out of the basement of his Silver Lake  home, no more than one per year to “someone I know,” he said Thursday.
He plans to seek an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission regarding whether his gun sale business conflicts with a potential leadership position in the Senate, he said Thursday.
Ciccone has routinely voted against stricter gun protections throughout his 22 years in the Senate, including the safe storage bill signed into law in 2024. And he doesn’t support an assault-style weapons ban, at least as currently proposed.
“The fact that someone owns a semi-automatic shotgun, or rifle they hunt with, or a pistol, I don’t define that as an assault weapon,” Ciccone said.
Companion bills introduced by Sen. Lou DiPalma and Rep. Jason Knight would ban the sale of various types of semi-automatic shotguns and rifles. The legislation also requires residents who already own assault-style weapons to register them with a police department, which Ciccone contends is unconstitutional.
Ciccone said he would be open to an alternative proposal that eliminates the registry and narrows the definition of assault-style weapons to machine guns, similar to what the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has considered as assault weapons absent a formal federal definition. Gun rights advocates expressed similar views during a March 26 hearing on Knight’s bill in the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate Committee on Judiciary has not yet held an initial hearing on DiPalma’s companion bill.
DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, said Thursday he was open to amending the language of his bill, including the registry component and the definition of an assault-style weapon.
“I am still focused on getting this over the goal line,” DiPalma said. “We need to get it done, and get it done this session. But ‘done’ does not mean the bill we have is the exact bill we are going to pass.”
DiPalma has decided, but declined to say, who he would be supporting in the Senate leadership elections. DiPalma had spoken with Ciccone and Lawson, but not Pearson, as of Thursday morning,
Listening to voters 
Ruggerio and Ciccone share similar politics, ages and union backgrounds. Their shared history spans four decades, dating back to when Ciccone was business manager of the Rhode Island Judicial, Professional, and Technical Employees Local Union 808.
The pair would bicker constantly — just like brothers —  Ciccone said, but always worked it out in the end.
Ciccone, who chairs the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming, said his union experience translated well to Smith Hill.
“You have to listen to everyone, hear them out, and try to work out an agreement,” Ciccone said. “I enjoy the fact everybody [in the Senate] has a different opinion. They represent different constituencies.”
Ciccone cited his constituents’ viewpoints as the reason why he voted against legalizing gay marriage in 2010. 
“I represent a district with five Catholic churches and a large Hispanic population,” Ciccone said. “They were not in favor of it. What do I do? Go against my constituents?”
Little comfort to Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Pawtucket Democrat. 
“As a member of the LGBTQ caucus, I cannot vote for someone who is not in full-throated support of the rights of my community,” Kallman said in an interview Thursday.
Ciccone also opposed the state’s 2019 law codifying Roe V. Wade, and the 2023 law expanding insurance coverage for abortion access. 
“That issue has come and went and now it’s decided,” he said.
Ciccone is a co-sponsor on a Republican-backed proposal introduced this year that would repeal the state’s 2021 Act on Climate Law, which set decarbonization mandates with the goal of reaching net-zero by 2050.
Ciccone said the purpose of his support was to “start a discussion” around the state’s ability to meet the incremental decarbonization benchmarks laid out in the existing law.
“I want to be realistic,” Ciccone said, who voted in favor of the original bill in 2021.
But Kallman called Act on Climate “the single-most important and ambitious piece of legislation” passed since she was elected in 2020.
“The Act on Climate is key to my generation and anyone younger than me being able to survive,” she said. 
Rebuilding the bench
Kallman, 41, and Mack, 31, both pushed for new blood in leadership — in age and political philosophy.
“We need a Senate chamber that is also going to have a bold vision, maybe not the boldest, but someone who’s not going to just copy and paste what our Senate president did,” Mack said.

– Sen. Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat and co-chair of the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Caucus


Mack, who co-chairs the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Caucus, also highlighted the lack of diversity in a Lawson-Ciccone ticket.
Pearson is 36, and openly gay — the first member of the Senate leadership team to identify as such when he was chosen to be majority leader in 2022.
“This is a chance to have an LGBTQ+ leader, a millennial leader, a different path,” Mack said.
Her comments come hours before David Hogg, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is set to headline a Rhode Island Democratic Party fundraiser at Fish Co. in Providence Thursday night. Hogg has been vocal about his efforts to unseat long-time party incumbents in Congress and “rebuild the bench” with new, younger representation.
Liz Beretta-Perik, state party chair, did not immediately return requests for comment Thursday about Hogg’s position on incumbents.
Ciccone said he was in good health and his age should not be a factor. He remained focused on “restoring” the chamber, noting the need for fiscal responsibility amid a projected deficit in fiscal 2026 and uncertainty over federal funding. 
“My door, similar to Dominick’s, is going to be open,” Ciccone said.

Federal government appeals ruling ordering detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont 

by Alan J. Keays 
April 23, 2025, 1:40 pmApril 23, 2025, 3:38 pm 



Attorneys for Öztürk filed a lawsuit alleging her detention was unlawful. In the suit, they argue she was wrongly targeted in violation of her free speech rights. Öztürk had co-authored an op-ed in Tufts’ student newspaper last year that called on the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel and to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.” Sessions, the Vermont federal judge, last week ordered the federal government to transfer Öztürk from Louisiana to Vermont. “Ms. Ozturk has presented viable and serious habeas claims which warrant urgent review on the merits,” he wrote, scheduling a bail hearing for May 9. Acting U.S. Attorney for the district of Vermont Michael Drescher, representing ICE and other federal agencies and officials in the case, appealed the decision earlier this week. He has signalled that the administration will seek “emergency relief” from the appeals court in an effort to halt Öztürk’s transfer.This story will be updated.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge rejects federal government’s attempt to halt detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rumeysa-ozturk-8-20250414.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, defends a compromise provision shifting teaching scholarships named after Black former lawmakers to five teacher-strapped counties on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill to limit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools, state government and health profession licensing advanced to the governor Thursday following a 64-26 vote in the House and a 34-16 tally in the Senate.
Senate Bill 289 — authored by Republican Sens. Tyler Johnson of Leo, and Gary Byrne of Byrneville — was tweaked in the final days of the session to specifically outlaw “discrimination” in state education, public employment and licensing settings that is “based on a personal characteristic of the person.”
Lawmakers also made last-minute changes to characteristics outlined in the bill, removing “disability and status as a veteran” from the list. The “personal characteristics” remaining in the bill are “race, religion, color, sex, national origin, or ancestry.”
“You can’t fix discrimination with discrimination,” Byrne said. “This bill is good for Indiana, and everybody should be judged by how hard you work — and that’s what this bill is about.”
The latest draft exempts “employment action(s) concerning participation in a public contract by a minority business enterprise, women’s business enterprise, or veteran business enterprise, if the employment action is authorized by law.”
A carveout also exists for colleges and universities. Schools can also make decisions around grants, scholarships or fee remissions on the basis of “personal characteristic(s)” as long as those awards do not include any “state funds or resources.”
But state offices and universities would not be allowed to require employees to complete training — or licensing — “asserting that, or endorsing the theory that,” a person with a certain personal characteristic:

is inherently superior or inferior to a person with a different personal characteristic;

or has a moral character that is determined by a personal characteristic of the person.

Opposition remained
Democrats remained opposed to the bill on Thursday — particularly in the Senate, where debate lasted nearly two hours.
“In a utopia, every human should be treated equally and should not be discriminated against based on their race, their gender, their creed, their nationality, their political identity,” said Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “But this legislation is extremely harmful because it gives a blind eye to historical injustices by which generations of communities have been discriminated against.”
“It flips the script by saying we have no discrimination, we have no racism, and we should treat everybody equally. It ignores historical facts that continue to occur until this moment,” he continued. “This legislation ignores that people have different starting points in their lives, and in most of our history as a country, it was our government that pushed people behind the starting line.”
The legislation’s passage comes on the heels of Gov. Mike Braun’s executive order to replace DEI throughout state government policies and programming with “merit, excellence and innovation,” or MEI.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton dropped the news Thursday afternoon that the 60-day legislative session will not as end as scheduled at the end of next week.
That’s due to an impasse between the House and Senate’s respectively passed budgets, specifically regarding their competing sales tax packages.
“At this time, I am disappointed to report we have not yet reached an agreement on allocations with the House,” Albritton told senators shortly after 2 p.m., when he acknowledged that the biggest hurdle remains the discrepancy between what type of package to present and how significant those tax cuts would be.
There is roughly a $4.4 billion gap between the proposed budgets of the two chambers.  The Senate’s proposed budget appropriates $117.36 billion, while the House’s proposal totals $112.95 billion.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month a state sales tax rate cut from 6% to 5.25%, which would save taxpayers’ approximately $5 billion annually.
Albritton followed up with a more modest $2.1 billion tax plan, centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of the plan included a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
His proposal included authorizing an analysis of the potential effects of eliminating property taxes, a proposal first floated by Gov. DeSantis, with the possibility of putting that idea before the voters via a constitutional amendment in 2026
Albritton said Thursday that his preference remains to focus “on a responsible level of targeted, broad-based sales tax relief this session, leaving room for voters to consider a more comprehensive reduction in property taxes at the next general election.”
He said that he and Senate Appropriations Chair Ed Hooper had spent “countless hours” with staff considering the House’s sales tax cut proposal and long-term budget assumptions “from every angle we can think of.”
“I understand their perspective and applaud their resolve to pursue better government, and I have immense respect for the Speaker and his entire team,” he said — adding, however that, “at the end of the day, I’m just uncomfortable with a proposal I believe will likely lead to shortfalls, if not substantial shortfalls, in the out-years.”
“Make no mistake about it, I am committed to passing historic, unprecedented tax relief. However, it won’t be at the expense of the long-term financial stability of our state.”
Albritton did say that the Senate is moving with alacrity when it comes to passing legislation — so much so that he was cancelling Friday’s scheduled floor session. He ended his briefing by saying that legislators “can head home for the weekend,” leading to a standing ovation from the senators in the chamber.
The  Legislature is constitutionally required to pass a balanced state budget before the  2025-2026 fiscal year starts on July 1. The 60-day legislative session was scheduled to end on Friday, May 2. There have been no additional details whether the Legislature will continue to immediately work past that date, or opt to return later in May or June.

Senate Bill 25-304 now heads to the Senate Appropriation Committee for consideration.
“What our criminal legal system needs — and what, more importantly, our survivors need — is for things to get done quickly,” said bill sponsor Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat. “The reason that we should care about quickly turning around sex assault evidence kits, to use that bloodless term, is because we owe one survivor justice, and maybe if we do that quickly enough, we can catch somebody and the next one or two or 10 survivors don’t have to become survivors in the first place.”

The bill is partially modeled on legislation from the Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee that was never introduced.
It would create a coordinator position at CBI to oversee the agency’s process and progress of completing the sexual assault kits, which include DNA samples and other evidence from survivors to aid in a criminal investigation. Colorado’s forensic services are facing a historic backlog of the kits due to reduced staff capacity and ballooning fallout from the discovery that former CBI forensic scientist Yvonne “Missy” Woods manipulated more than a thousand DNA test results over her career.
As of March, there were 1,424 kits in the backlog with an average turnaround time of 558 days, according to a recently implemented data dashboard. The backlog means delayed justice for survivors, as DNA evidence can often be critical for a criminal conviction.
“The impact of this growing delay in turnaround time for sexual assault evidence kits to be processed and analyzed is devastating for individual survivors, as so many of you have heard this spring, but it’s also destructive to public trust in our institutions and systems,” said Elizabeth Newman, the policy director for the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
The coordinator considered under Weissman’s bill would report annually to the Legislature on data including the number of kits completed, the number of cases in the backlog, the capacity of state crime laboratories and the amount of additional DNA collected from crime scenes not captured in a kit. The coordinator would also assess and make recommendations on the efficiency of the testing process. That would ultimately bring a “cross-silo awareness” of what is happening at the state level lab and various local labs, Weissman said.
He said the coordinator position’s roles and responsibilities will likely change through the amendment process as he speaks with stakeholders.
The coordinator position would be paid for with a $150,000 grant using state general fund money.
The bill would also create a new notification requirement under the Victim Rights Act that would require a law enforcement agency to update a survivor on the status of their kit every 90 days.
It also sets a turnaround goal of 60 days. The agency’s current goal is 90 days, which it expects to achieve in 2027.
“To be real clear, I don’t think that we’re going to get there next month, but I do believe that we can build up our system to where we can get here, and I believe that we should make that promise to the impacted people in our state and to our future selves by putting it in statute,” Weissman said.
Lance Allen, CBI’s deputy director of forensic services, told lawmakers that he does not think the bill as written would reduce turnaround time for rape kits. He outlined recent actions from the agency, including using $3 million of repurposed funds to outsource processing for about 1,000 kits and hiring a third-party contractor to assess best practices.
“We have a plan to get rid of the backlog and fortunately have received funding to address a good portion of that, and then with the training that we are doing at the state level, we will be increasing our resources and be able to handle that capacity at the state level,” he said. “I wholeheartedly acknowledge that CBI is in the process of rebuilding trust. We know that.”
CBI currently has 16 scientists working at the state lab and is training 15 more.
So far, Weissman is the only sponsor on the bill. If it passes the Senate Appropriations Committee, it will move to the entire Senate for consideration, and then the House. The lawmaking term ends on May 7.

Free.,Trump administration faces suit over withheld family planning funds,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-faces-suit-over-withheld-family-planning-funds,,"WASHINGTON — The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in federal court Thursday challenging the Trump administration’s decision to withhold Title X family planning grants.The 35-page filing alleges the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the reproductive health program with funding approved by Congress, has withheld $65.8 million over disagreements about organizations’ “opposition to racism” and “providing care to undocumented immigrants.”“The Affected Members and their subrecipients operate hundreds of Title X service sites across these states, which together provide family planning care to hundreds of thousands of low-income patients, many of whom would not otherwise be able to afford such care,” the complaint says. “Depriving these individuals of the high-quality, essential health care provided by Title X-funded health centers reduces access to (sexually transmitted infection) screening and treatment, cancer screening, and contraception, threatens the health and wellbeing of the individuals who rely on Title X for care, and undermines public health.”The lawsuit contends California, Hawaiʻi, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah have been completely cut off from Title X family planning grants, while Alaska, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia have had their access to the funding reduced.The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia but hadn’t been assigned to a judge as of Thursday afternoon.HHS did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Another suitThe lawsuit is the latest filed by organizations and Democratic state attorneys general challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze funding for dozens of programs.Some, but not all, of the cases are subject to injunctions from district courts that so far have prevented the spending cuts from taking effect while the cases proceed.The Impoundment Control Act, a 1970s-era law that requires the president to spend the money Congress appropriates, is the subject of many of the disagreements between those filing lawsuits and the Trump administration.The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association wrote in the lawsuit that it represents nearly 900 members, including state, county and local health departments.Its members “operate or administer more than 3,000 health centers that provide family planning services to more than 2.2 million patients each year.”HHS sent letters to some of the association’s members in late March, notifying them that their Title X family planning grant funding was “being temporarily withheld based on possible violations of the terms and conditions set forth in the notice of award,” according to the complaint.The lawsuit alleges HHS’ decision to freeze the funding stems from its members having statements on their websites “indicating support for diversity, equity, and inclusion and opposition to racism, which, HHS claims, ‘suggests’ that the Affected Members are or may be engaged in conduct that violates federal civil rights laws.”The federal government also chose to withhold the Title X funding over “a single public statement that HHS claims gives it ‘reason to believe’ that some of the Affected Members may be providing care to undocumented immigrants, in violation of Executive Order 14218 ‘Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.’”The lawsuit says that HHS never actually told any of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association’s members that they had violated federal regulations, executive orders, or the law. The letters from HHS referenced only “possible violations.”",,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Free.,Federal judges pause U.S. Education Department enforcement of DEI ban,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judges-pause-us-education-department-enforcement-dei-ban,,"A federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pause enforcement of a new U.S. Education Department ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices.The order came as another federal judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the Trump administration from yanking federal funding from many schools.The New Hampshire order, though, only applied to schools that employ members of the National Education Association — the country’s largest labor union, which brought the case challenging the ban — or the Center for Black Educator Development.The rulings used different legal logic but arrived at the same conclusion: The administration’s ban on race-conscious practices is not valid.In Maryland, U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher said she ruled not on the merits of the policy, but the way the Trump administration developed it.“This Court takes no view as to whether the policies at issue here are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair. But this Court is constitutionally required to closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires,” she wrote. “The government did not.”Gallagher’s order pauses the enforcement of a Feb. 14 letter to school districts from Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in programming, admissions, scholarships and other aspects of student life.In New Hampshire, U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty wrote that “the loss of federal funding would cripple the operations of many educational institutions.”McCafferty’s order has a nationwide effect, but McCafferty limited it to schools that employ NEA members, rejecting the union’s attempt to completely halt the policies outlined in the letter.Teachers unions suedThe Feb. 14 letter drew swift legal action, and the National Education Association brought the suit in New Hampshire against the administration alongside the Center for Black Educator Development. The American Federation of Teachers — one of the largest teachers unions in the country — filed a complaint in February alongside its affiliate, AFT-Maryland. The American Sociological Association and a public school district in Oregon also sued over the letter.“Today the court confirmed the importance of our job as educators to foster opportunity, dignity, and engagement,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement after the Maryland ruling.“The court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history, and knowledge itself,” she added. “It would hamper efforts to extend access to education, and dash the promise of equal opportunity for all, a central tenet of the United States since its founding.”NEA also celebrated the preliminary injunction granted in its case Thursday, and the union’s president, Becky Pringle, said in a statement “today’s ruling allows educators and schools to continue to be guided by what’s best for students, not by the threat of illegal restrictions and punishment.”The statement said President Donald Trump, billionaire head of the U.S. DOGE Service Elon Musk and Education Secretary Linda McMahon were responsible for an “attack” on public education.“The fact is that Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Linda McMahon are using politically motivated attacks and harmful and vague directives to stifle speech and erase critical lessons to attack public education, as they work to dismantle public schools,” Pringle said. “This is why educators, parents, and community leaders are organizing, mobilizing, and using every tool available to protect our students and their futures.”The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.Letter raised questionsIn the February letter, Trainor offered a wide-ranging interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023 involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, which struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.Trainor wrote that though the ruling “addressed admissions decisions, the Supreme Court’s holding applies more broadly.”The four-page letter raised a slew of questions for schools across pre-K through college over what fell within the requirements, and the department later released a Frequently Asked Questions document on the letter in an attempt to provide more guidance.Earlier this month, the Education Department gave state education leaders just days to certify all K-12 schools in their states were complying with the letter in order to keep receiving federal financial assistance. The department and the groups suing in the New Hampshire case later reached an agreement that paused enforcement.",,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Money was on the mind of the Iowa Board of Regents and the faculty and staff who spoke during its April meeting, with members discussing potential tuition changes, contracts for union members and salaries for non-union university employees.
Board President Sherry Bates, in remarks to the board, addressed the “difficult balance” of weighing the costs to students and the funds universities need to provide a quality education when determining tuition, assuring those present the board takes the responsibility very seriously.
Bates also announced a new committee that will conduct a study of potentially offering students a tuition guarantee, meaning their tuition costs won’t increase after their first year of undergraduate education. The committee, comprised of Regents David Barker and Christine Hensley, should have the study complete and ready to present to the board at its November meeting, Bates said.
“Setting tuition rates is one of the most important things the board does,” Bates said. “I have served on the board for a decade, and we have always been thoughtful and deliberative when considering tuition rates.”

Legislation awaiting Gov. Kim Reynolds’ signature would direct the board of regents and state universities to complete such a study, as well as set an April 30 deadline for the board to approve tuition rates for the upcoming academic year.
This year, the board will consider final approval of 2025-2026 tuition rates at its June meeting. The proposal for tuition, including 3% increases at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and a 2.7% increase at the University of Northern Iowa for in-state undergraduate students, saw its first reading Thursday with no discussion or questions from the board.
Board ratifies union contracts
The board also ratified contracts for unions operating on state university campuses, including the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS), United Faculty and Service Employees International Union (SEIU). United Faculty and SEIU represent UNI faculty and tertiary health care employees at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, respectively.
Each of the unions will receive a 3% increase to base wages and minimum salaries in 2025 and 2026, according to contract summaries, with returning COGS and SEIU members set to earn additional 3% increases both years.
For university staff and faculty not organized under a union, representatives from the UI faculty senate and staff council, ISU faculty senate and professional and scientific council and UNI professional and scientific council spoke to the board Thursday about their work and the need for salary increases.
Caroline Sheerin, UI faculty senate president and law professor, said when adjusted for inflation, what she makes as a professor 20 years into the role is less than half of what she made in her first year of practicing law.
“You’ll just have to believe me when I say that the reason we do this work is not because we are looking to be heavily compensated,” Sheerin said. “The doctors, lawyers and engineers who draw a paycheck from this institution could be making far, far more money in the private sector.”
Faculty members work year-round, despite having nine-month contracts and the summer supposedly off, because they love teaching, researching, treating patients and more. Any increases to compensation the board can implement for faculty and staff would be “very welcome,” she said.
UNI Museum Director and Chief Curator Nathan Arndt spoke to the board on behalf of the 631 members of the professional and scientific council, of which almost half work in academic advancement as teachers or teaching support, he said.
All professional and scientific staff are essential to maintaining UNI as a “robust and healthy living learning community,” he said, and by better supporting them, the board would help both the students, institution and state as a whole.
“While it often goes unnoticed or unmentioned, many in this group feel they are often ignored, written off or overworked,” Arndt said. “Their drive to our student success is what keeps us passionate about our work, and I encourage you, the board of regents, to pay more attention.”
Jason Follett, ISU academic advisor and president of the professional and scientific council, concurred that the people he works with have been feeling “undervalued for some time.” While he applauded the work of the board and its staff, including the formation of a legislative committee, he said universities are still facing flat or lessening funding from the state, students are still dealing with rising tuition and outdated facilities and salaries are not keeping pace with costs.
Follett issued a challenge to members of the board on behalf of his team — work with lawmakers in both parties and advocate for ISU and employees of other state universities in order to show their importance to their institutions and the state.
“Just as we expect our elected officials to be responsive and engaged, the professional scientific council humbly requests that regents themselves be more active and visible beyond these meetings and through staff and press releases,” Follett said. “Get out and be proactive versus reactive and inactive.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Researchers at the University of Utah recently published a first-of-its-kind study that measures the impact dust has on melting snow in the Colorado River basin.
Dust has long been credited to accelerating snowmelt in the Intermountain West. Blowing from arid regions and settling in the mountains, the dust darkens the snow, lowering its albedo — essentially, darker snow doesn’t reflect the sunlight as well, leading to more heat absorption and speeding up the melting process. 
It’s particularly prevalent in the Colorado River basin, with large mountain ranges like the San Juans, La Sals and Maroon Bells pushed up against dry expanses of desert. As drought continues to impact the region, dust events have worsened, depleting the snowpack at faster rates and complicating an already precarious situation for the Colorado River and the 40 million people who get their drinking water from it. 
And while previous papers have recorded the impact dust has on snowmelt, University of Utah researchers are the first to study an area as large as the Colorado River headwaters, which spans multiple states. According to the university, there are no snowmelt models — streamflow forecasts in mountain basins essential for areas that rely on snowpack for water — that take dust into account.

“The degree of darkening caused by dust has been related to water forecasting errors. The water comes earlier than expected, and this can have real world impacts — for example if the ground is still frozen it’s too early for farmers to use. A reservoir manager can store early snowmelt, but they need the information to plan for that,” said McKenzie Skiles, associate professor at the university’s School of Environment, Society and Sustainability. “If we can start to build dust into the snowmelt forecast models, it will make water management decision-making more informed.”
Stiles is a co-lead author of the study, which was published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters in March. 
Stiles and other researchers analyzed 23 years of satellite images, from 2021 to 2023, to observe snow darkened by dust in the spring months. They found that dust accelerated snowmelt in the Colorado River Basin every spring, even during less-dusty years.
During runoff season, typically between April and May, the snowpack melts about 10 to 15 millimeters each day. According to the study, dust deposition can accelerate snowmelt by 1 millimeter per hour during peak sunlight — during a “high-dust” year, that can factor out to about 10 extra millimeters each day. 
“It’s not just how much dust gets deposited over a season, but also the timing of dust deposition that matters,” said Patrick Naple, doctoral candidate of geography at the University of Utah and lead author of the study. “Dust is very effective at speeding up melt because it’s most frequently deposited in the spring when days are getting longer and the sun more intense. Even an extra millimeter per hour can make the snowpack disappear several weeks earlier than without dust deposition.”
One of the most comprehensive analyses of dust and snowmelt yet, the university says this research could improve water forecasting and allocation for communities that rely on the Colorado River.

Others remain in a holding pattern as they decide the future of some services.,"The walls inside the Middletown Library Service Center are lined with books — reading materials for summer and book club programs, books for the visually impaired and more, as well as some puppets of characters in children’s books. 
It’s a resource hub for other libraries and schools in Connecticut, and about half of its employees are paid with federal money. But with the recent loss of federal funding for the state library, those resources and services that schools and other libraries have come to depend on could be at risk.
The Middletown center is among the Connecticut libraries and museums facing funding cuts from the Institute of Museums and Library Services, part of a larger effort driven by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to curtail government spending.
And just down the street is a stark reminder of the existential threat facing the librarians and programs.

Two tall wooden beams hold up a large sign that reads “Department of Government Efficiency.” It portrays President Donald J. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, wearing sunglasses, against an American flag backdrop, in an apparent nod to the work of DOGE that has reshaped the federal government.
Through IMLS’ Grants to States program, the Connecticut State Library received $2.1 million a year. Every state gets money allocated through a population-based formula. As of last week, State Librarian Deborah Schander said Connecticut was one of three states, along with Washington and California, that had current fiscal year grants terminated midyear. That loss will amount to almost $1 million.

Seven grantees in Connecticut were set to receive a total of nearly $3 million in IMLS funding, with most of it to be doled out over a few years. Some of that money had been spent this year, but the vast majority of it is now gone for grantees like the state library and the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford.
The cuts are leaving many of these educational and cultural hubs in limbo. Some of these Connecticut institutions need to lay off workers or consultants, while others remain in a holding pattern as they decide the future of some services and see if they can fill in the gaps.
The Institute of Museum and Library Services is among the federal agencies caught in the Trump administration’s push to remake the federal government, though IMLS is smaller than most and its grants made up a tiny fraction of all federal spending. Trump signed an executive order in late March dramatically paring back that department and six others that he deemed “unnecessary.”
That prompted IMLS to place staff on administrative leave. Within days, libraries and museums that received funding were informed of the immediate termination of their grants.
The order to dismantle IMLS and other agencies is tied up in a lawsuit backed by a coalition of state attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong.
Every recipient received a letter in early April about the termination of federal funding, saying the grant is “unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interests of the United States.” The letter goes on to say it’s repurposing funds in a new way to support the president’s agenda.
This caught many recipients off guard, leaving some angry and confused. They are currently dealing with tough decisions about how to make up that funding.
“This is libraries. This is cultural heritage. This is who we are. It’s just appalling,” said Sam Quigley, director of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London. “When do museums and libraries not serve the interest of the United States?”

A group of affected library and museum grantees recently met by Zoom to discuss the funding cuts, though many of them had already been in contact with one another since receiving their grant termination letters. Grantees have had different experiences with making last-minute requests to draw down funding after the termination letters. Some were denied, while others were able to get their final reimbursements.
They recently received another letter, requiring grantees to submit a report by May 12 detailing what progress they achieved under the grant as well as itemized charges.
The termination of federal funding has put a financial strain on some of the arts and humanities nonprofits. Many of them will not be able to make up the loss in funding. That has put added pressure on them to consider fundraising from elsewhere to fill in the gaps and tap into the private sector.
The Connecticut State Library was the biggest recipient in the state of IMLS funding, which it has received since the agency was created in 1996. The state library also got two other awards in one-time funding this year through the same agency. 
The larger grant — $2 million to support 13 staff members in the Division of Library Development — provides resources to boost local libraries and build capacity. It also supports the CT Library for Accessible Books, which helps provide audio and braille books. That program benefits about 5,500 patrons in Connecticut, including around 300 veterans.

Schander said the federal funding is tailored to certain state needs and gives them a framework to make local decisions.
“It is possible that we will have to make some hard decisions about the library services we provide,” Schander said. “We are in active conversations and considering what to do moving forward. We’re currently operating as usual. We know we will need to make decisions in the near future about what to do.”
The Middletown Library Service Center, which is part of the CT State Library, is likely to feel the ramifications of the funding loss, though most of its programs are mandated by state statute.
It is waiting to see what funding cuts mean for the state budget and how state lawmakers might adjust the budget to account for federal losses. In the meantime, Dawn La Valle, director of the Division of Library Development for the state library system, said they’re carrying on with the work.
“We’re still operating as is. It’s a difficult situation,” La Valle said. 
La Valle said by offering training for librarians, larger bundles of books, access to technology and reading guides for kids, the library center saves local Connecticut libraries millions of dollars each year. For example, the center provides the software that allows kids to count books and pages read for their summer reading program.

Kymberlee Powe, the children and young adult consultant at the division, just finished putting together a summer reading list for libraries. And Monday, other staff were busy preparing dozens of copies of the state’s Nutmeg Book Awards for distribution.
Libraries or classrooms that want a large group of kids to read a book often get multiple copies from the Middletown center. They also provide books for schools participating in the Battle of the Books reading competition, and offer “bundles,” for classrooms exploring topics such as Connecticut history or social-emotional learning, Powe said. 
The center trains librarians in new technologies and ways of managing programs. They also operate the Connecticut Library for Accessible Books. The Middletown center has technology and books available for people to check out if they are visually impaired or otherwise disabled and need an accessible device for “talking books,” or books read aloud.
They also have devices that offer electronic books in braille. On Monday, one of the reader consultants spoke with a patron who was running low on books. He asked for more of his favorites, which she was able to look up.
“The usual?” she asked. “OK, we’ll get a cartridge out to you tomorrow.”

That program is federally funded through the Library of Congress. While it’s not immediately at risk, Matt Geeza, the Middletown program’s director, said he still doesn’t know what the future looks like in federal funding.
Museums too
Connecticut museums that get federal money are also feeling the squeeze. 
The Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford received federal funding through IMLS’ Museums Empowered program. The museum was in the middle of the first year of their grant, which was $228,000 over three years. The award was terminated mid-year, and they spent about a third of it. The loss will amount to about $180,000.
The money helped them train staff in engagement and audience evaluation and hire consultants to do focus groups and surveys to inform how they prepare for new programs and exhibits. They will not have any staffing cuts but will lose all of their consultants — some of whom were based in Connecticut or the northeast.
Jessica Neuwirth, deputy director for strategic initiatives and development at the Mark Twain House & Museum, noted there is “no other funding out there for this kind of work.”
“It’s crucial that we learn about and engage with the community around us,” Neuwirth said. “We need to figure out how to go forward. The path is not clear at the moment.”
“I think we all know that a vibrant arts and culture scene improves every community that it’s a part of,” she added. “To lose that is to lose the glue that keeps us together.”

It was the museum’s first Museums Empowered grant. The Mark Twain House & Museum was hopeful it would get funding through the National Endowment for the Humanities, but that now seems unlikely after major NEH cuts from the Trump administration.
Other museums in Connecticut have used IMLS funding for years.
Now the director of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London, Quigley said the museum has received those federal dollars for the past nine years. The most recent grant of $151,000 started last September and was intended to last for three years.
This one helped the museum hire a full-time staffer who would specifically work on the museum’s fiber and textile collection this year. But without that money, they cannot keep up that role. Quigley said they are trying to give that employee some buffer time and will keep her on until May 17.
The museum hoped to image and rehouse 3,000 objects. Over the past eight months of having the grant, they got through close to 500. Quigley said the employee covered by federal funding helped move from paper-based to digital records and improved access so people interested in art all over the world can have virtual access to their collection.
“We don’t know if there will be somebody who can come to our rescue,” Quigley said. “Given the economic turmoil of this time, people are getting nervous about making gifts of this magnitude.”
For Quigley, the federal funding has been about better accessibility to the public, in Connecticut and beyond.
“It’s depriving the public of information about collections that they rightly should have. It’s all about accessibility. We can’t possibly show a large percentage of our collection at any given time. To provide digital access is the next best thing,” Quigley said.
The loss of that funding leaves a big question mark about the future of some priorities.
“They kind of help keep the lights on. They do all the back-end work,” he said about IMLS funding. “Nobody else pays for that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0421_SR_Libraries_273-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 15:15:52.595620
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-24 19:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge blocks Trump push to cut funding to schools over DEI,Erica E. Phillips and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/24/dei-education-funding-trump/,CT education leaders hailed a federal judge's ruling that blocked directives that threatened to cut funding for schools with DEI programs.,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump administration directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, which accused the Republican administration of violating teachers’ due process and First Amendment rights.
“This is exactly what we want to see,” Kate Dias, president of Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union. “A lot of the actions by the Department of Education under the Trump administration have been intentionally vague, trying to confuse, and get compliance based off the lack of clarity.” 
“Those efforts need to be questioned,” Dias said.
In February, the U.S. Education Department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. Earlier this month, the department ordered states to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.”
Last week, Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said the state responded to the request and would not be submitting signatures.
The Trump administration’s directives do not carry the force of law but threaten to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools were warned that continuing such practices “in violation of federal law” could lead to U.S. Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts.
The lawsuit argued that the orders were “unconstitutionally vague,” an issue underscored in the ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty.
She said the April letter does not make clear what the department believes a DEI program entails or when it believes such programs cross the line into violating civil rights law. “The Letter does not even define what a ‘DEI program’ is,” McCafferty wrote.
The judge also said there is reason to believe the department’s actions amount to a violation of teachers’ free speech rights.
“A professor runs afoul of the 2025 Letter if she expresses the view in her teaching that structural racism exists in America, but does not do so if she denies structural racism’s existence. That is textbook viewpoint discrimination,” McCafferty wrote.
The lawsuit filed in March argues the Feb. 14 memo, formally known as a “Dear Colleague” letter, would limit academic freedom by dictating what students can be taught.
The memo said schools have promoted DEI efforts at the expense of white and Asian American students. It dramatically expands the interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the use of race in college admissions to all aspects of education, including, hiring, promotion, scholarships, housing, graduation ceremonies and campus life.
Steven Hernández, executive director of education advocacy group ConnCAN, said the federal guidance “fundamentally misunderstands the very purpose of good diversity, equity and inclusion policy and initiatives.”
DEI is about “understanding the value that every human being brings into a space,” he said. “When you mandate DEI initiatives that are shallow on their face — or exclude them writ large — what you’re doing is exacerbating the disconnect and closing the door on meaningful conversations and relationships.”
The memo faces another challenge from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which has asked a federal court in Maryland to stop the department from enforcing it.
Both lawsuits argue that the guidance is so vague that it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed.
CEA’s Dias said she’s hoping a similar ruling in the Maryland case comes soon, “that says, ‘Listen, you cannot make vague threats. That does not work.'”
President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, had warned of potential funding cuts if states did not return the form by Friday.
In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools,” she said.
The April directive asked states to collect the certification form from local school districts and also sign it on behalf of the state, giving assurance that schools are in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Schools and states are already required to give assurances to that effect in separate paperwork, but the new form adds language on DEI, warning that using diversity programs to discriminate can bring funding cuts, fines and other penalties.
The form threatens schools’ access to Title I, the largest source of federal revenue for K-12 education and a lifeline for schools in low-income areas.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113784490343-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

Mar-Jac Poultry was named one of the “Dirty Dozen” in a Thursday report by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health. It made the list last year, too. Other companies on the list are in areas including agriculture, retail, health care, fast food, strip clubs, food manufacturing and private prisons. 
“These companies have failed to eliminate known, preventable hazards – risking lives through negligence, and in at least one case, actively opposing stronger worker protections,” the report states. 
Themes of the “Dirty Dozen” report are sudden workplace trauma, heat exposure and immigrant labor. The report’s release coincides with Workers Memorial Week, which is from April 23 to May 1.
Three workers have died in Mar-Jac facilities since 2020, including 16-year-old Duvan Pérez at its Hattiesburg processing plant in 2023. 
While cleaning a deboning machine, he was caught in a rotating shaft and pulled in, according to an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Federal labor laws don’t allow those under the age of 18 to work in meat processing because of dangerous machinery. 
A February 2023 wrongful death lawsuit filed by Pérez’s family alleges that a temporary staffing agency assigned him to complete work that he was legally unable to do due to his age. The suit also alleges Mar-Jac had a history of worker safety issues. 
In a statement after the teenager’s death, Mar-Jac said staffing companies are responsible for verifying employee’s age and identification, and an attorney for the company told NBC News last year that Pérez used identification of a 32-year-old man to get the job. 
A jury trial for the lawsuit is scheduled for March 11, 2026, in Forrest County. 
Last year, OSHA cited Mar-Jac for over $212,000 in penalties for multiple safety failures, including failure to protect from hazards like falls, machine entanglement and electrocution. Last summer, Mar-Jac settled with OSHA and agreed to pay nearly $165,000 in fines and implement safety measures. 
At one of Mar-Jac’s Alabama plants, investigators from the U.S. Department of Labor found children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses – some who had been working there for months. 
Again, the company said the minors were hired with documents showing they were over 18 years old.
“Mar-Jac will continue to vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in this matter,” the company said in a statement to ABC News. “Mar-Jac is committed to complying with all relevant law.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073833/IMG_7037-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-24 15:15:52.595620

Ned Lamont said the new solar panels at prisons in Enfield, Cheshire and Somers are 'greener, cleaner and more affordable.'","Standing in front of an array of 4,500 Canadian solar panels and across from a wall topped with barbed wire, Gov. Ned Lamont today announced the completion of seven solar projects at prisons located in Enfield, Cheshire and Somers. 
The solar panels now bring power to parts of Cheshire Correctional Institution, Manson Youth Institute, Willard Correctional Institution, Carl Robinson Correctional Institution and Enfield Correctional Institution. 
“It’s greener, cleaner and more affordable,” Lamont said at a press conference at Cheshire Correctional Institution on Thursday — blanketed in springtime sun.
All together, the solar panels are estimated to save $11 million in energy costs to the Department of Correction over 25 years, according to the governor’s office and the Connecticut Green Bank.
The more than 15,000 panels across the seven facilities are also expected to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide the facilities produce by about 5,000 metric tons per year — the equivalent of 5.4 million pounds of coal, officials said. 
Nikki Dow, a solar project manager with the CT Green Bank, told The Connecticut Mirror that the project broke ground in 2023 and was completed at the end of 2024. She said the panels had been operating for the last few months. 
The project was a partnership between the CT Green Bank and the company TotalEnergies.  The state of Connecticut didn’t cover any of the cost.
Alex Sarly, Associate Director of Development for TotalEnergies, said the company had invested $20 million in the project, and will charge the state 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity. The rate will remain fixed for 25 years. 
Lamont praised the public-private partnership. Referencing a CT Mirror article from earlier this week, which reported New England’s demand for power hit an all-time low on Easter weekend, Lamont partially attributed that energy efficiency to the solar panels. 
“This is the way that we can reduce load upon our grid, hold down peak usage, hold down peak pricing, and make a difference for each and every one of you in your lives,” he said. 
Chris Iwanik, director of engineering for the Department of Correction, said the portion of energy use the solar panels replace varies among facilities and depending on the time of year. But he added that at Cheshire Correctional Institution, the solar panels could supply as much as 85% to 90% of the facility’s needs at its peak times. 
The state Department of Administrative Services has a power purchase agreement with the quasi-public Connecticut Green Bank, allowing state agencies to place solar cells on their properties. Michelle Gilman, Commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services, said the state is also working on solar projects at some of the state’s technical high schools, three state properties in Hartford and the Department of Labor headquarters in Wethersfield. 
Lamont said the state is also looking at partnering with TotalEnergies to provide solar panels to residences at a lower cost. 
“ It makes a big difference overall in terms of our grid and where we’re trying to go,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8630-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

(Photo via Google Earth) A new national study has found that private equity firms continue to purchase and then bankrupt nursing homes around the nation.
According to a report issued this week by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on the impact of the private equity industry on people and the planet, the percentage of American nursing homes now owned by private equity forms ranges from 5 to 13%, with the upper range of that estimate more likely due to the complex manner in which a facility’s true ownership is sometimes camouflaged.
That finding is consistent with a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office, which reported that while federal data shows at least 5% of nursing homes nationwide are owned by private equity firms, the data is flawed and the true number is likely higher.

In recent years, the acquisition of nursing homes by private equity investors has come under scrutiny by regulators, the media and members of Congress, with critics suggesting too many profit-minded investors are targeting care facilities for acquisition, starving them of cash while collecting a reliable stream of income from Medicare, and then cashing out, in some cases by filing for bankruptcy protection.
In its report, PESP examines six private equity-backed nursing home deals that occurred within the past three years. PESP found that at least three nursing home companies owned directly or indirectly by private equity firms have filed for bankruptcy in recent years: LaVie Care Centers/Consulate Health Care in 2024, Goldner Capital Management in 2024, and Gulf Coast Health Care in 2022.
One private equity firm buys 29 Iowa homes
One acquisition detailed in the report involves the private equity firm Cascade Capital Group, which in September 2024 acquired one of Iowa’s largest nursing home chains, ABCM Corp., for $85 million. The deal included 326 assisted living units as well as 29 nursing homes with 2,346 skilled-nursing beds.
The sale led to 7% of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes being handed over to a private equity firm. A Cascade Capital affiliate, Legacy Healthcare, now manages the homes.
Last year, the non-profit Center for Medicare Advocacy compared federal data from the Iowa homes with data on other Legacy-managed nursing homes and found that the Cascade/Legacy facilities had, on average, considerably lower ratings for overall performance and for their inspection outcomes. They also had lower nurse-staffing ratings, more abuse citations, higher federal civil money penalties, and more denials of payment for new admissions, the center found.
The federal data indicates the Cascade Capital facilities performed more poorly than homes under ABCM’s management, with the Cascade Capital facilities being fined 17 times as much as their ABCM counterparts.
Each ABCM facility had, on average, incurred $4,815 in federal fines over the past three years, while the Legacy-managed facilities averaged $83,994 in federal fines.
In October 2024, a month after Cascade acquired the Iowa nursing homes, a 45-year-old resident of the chain’s Harmony House Health Care Center in Waterloo died. Inspectors reported that the resident, who had special dietary restrictions that limited her food intake to soft, bite-sized items, choked after “stuffing an entire peanut butter and jelly sandwich in her mouth.”
The state alleged that “staff at Harmony House failed to develop and put in place an effective behavioral intervention plan that might have discouraged such behavior” and on Nov. 6, 2024, it imposed a $10,000 fine on the facility. State records show that fine has yet to be paid, with the full amount still owed.
Ownership not always revealed to regulators
The new report also highlights Gulf Coast Health Care’s acquisition of a nursing home chain that operated 28 skilled nursing facilities in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. In 2021, Gulf Coast was facing 167 personal injury or wrongful death claims and filed for bankruptcy.
“Multiple studies confirm the harmful effects that private equity ownership has on nursing homes, and the increased risk placed on residents and workers,” the report states. It cautions that the Trump administration may do little to address the issue, noting that during the president’s first term, federal protocols were revised “to discourage regulators from levying fines against nursing homes,” even in cases of resident deaths.
According to the New York Times, that effort was part of a broader plan to relax regulations and reduce bureaucracy and government oversight of business. For example, a requirement that every care facility employ at least one specialist in preventing infections was replaced with a requirement that an anti-infection specialist spend “sufficient time” at the facility.
The report recommends that federal and state agencies be given the authority to approve or reject mergers and sales involving nursing homes based on factors that include the potential impact on quality of care.
The report also calls for greater transparency in nursing home ownership. While homes are now required to report information about their owners, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, government authorities should be coordinating efforts to ensure that all facilities comply fully with such requirements.
Some ownership data kept secret by State of Iowa
The report also recommends that nursing homes be required to file public, consolidated cost reports that would detail the owners’ payments to themselves through affiliates and related parties, an amount now thought to be in the billions of dollars.
Under a state law that was approved in 2023, nursing home buyers in Iowa must submit to the state documentation of relationships to any related corporations and provide details of their projected revenue and expenses.
When asked whether the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing imposed such requirements on the buyers of the ABCM facilities, a department spokesperson said only that it followed the requirements of Iowa law, “which includes a robust financial analysis.”
The spokesperson noted that under state law, all of the information a buyer provides to the state that is related to their business relationships and compliance with the new financial regulations are treated as confidential and are not subject to public disclosure through the state’s Open Records Law.
Earlier this year, Sen. Claire Celsi, a West Des Moines Democrat, introduced Senate File 533, which would have barred the state from approving any change of ownership that results in a nursing home being acquired by a private equity fund or real estate investment trust.
That bill, as well as Senate File 536, which would have required the Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman to prioritize on-site visits to homes taken over by private equity firms, failed to advance.
The nursing home industry’s main lobbying organization, the American Health Care Association, has argued that with private equity firms owning as few as 5% of all homes, the issue is “distraction” from the real threats faced by facilities and their residents, such as workforce shortages.
In a written statement to McKnight’s Long-Term Care News, the AHCA said “the reality is that owners of long-term care facilities are extremely diverse and are often run by Main Street, not Wall Street.”

California uses Medicaid to pay for a range of nontraditional health care services, including housing. The Trump administration wants to scale back those programs.


In 2022, California made sweeping changes to its Medi-Cal program that reimagined what health care could look like for some of the state’s poorest and sickest residents by covering services from housing to healthy food. But the future of that program, known as CalAIM, could be at risk under the Trump administration. 
In recent weeks, federal officials have signaled that support for creative uses of Medi-Cal funding is waning, particularly uses that California has invested in such as rent assistance and medically tailored meals. Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.
The moves align with a narrower vision of Medicaid espoused by newly confirmed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services head Dr. Mehmet Oz, who said during his swearing-in ceremony that Medicaid spending was crowding out spending on education and other services in states with the federal government “paying most of the bill.”
“This one really bothers me. There are states who are using Medicaid — Medicaid dollars for people who are vulnerable — for services that are not medical,” Oz said.
It also fits with broader GOP calls to slim down the federal government. Medicaid is under scrutiny as part of a GOP-led budget process in the House of Representatives that calls for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years to programs including Medicaid.
“The messaging that we want to go back to the basics of Medicaid puts all of these waiver programs in jeopardy,” said John Baackes, former chief executive of L.A. Care, the state’s largest Medi-Cal health insurer.
CalAIM is authorized under a federal waiver that allows states to experiment with their Medicaid programs to try to save money and improve health outcomes. Under the waiver, California added extra benefits for high-cost users to help with food insecurity, housing instability,  substance use and behavioral health challenges.
Roughly half of all Medi-Cal spending can be attributed to 5% of high-cost users, according to state documents.
But in March, the federal government rescinded guidelines supporting Medi-Cal spending for social services. It also sent states a letter in April indicating that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would no longer approve a funding mechanism that helps support CalAIM, although that money will continue until 2026.
Together, these moves should worry states that operate programs like CalAIM, said Kathy Hempstead, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
“Under the Biden administration states were encouraged to experiment with things like that: To prescribe people prescriptions to get healthy food, to refer people to community-based services,” Hempstead said. “This administration is not receptive at all to … that vision of the Medicaid program.”
In a press release, CMS said it is putting an end to spending that isn’t “directly tied to health care services.”
“Mounting expenditures, such as covering housekeeping for individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or high-speed internet for rural healthcare providers, distracts from the core mission of Medicaid, and in some instances, serves as an overly-creative financing mechanism to skirt state budget responsibilities,” the press release states.
These signals from the federal government apply to future applications for Medicaid changes, and do not change California’s current programs or funding. The state’s CalAIM waiver expires at the end of 2026, and another similar waiver that supports California’s efforts to improve behavioral health care expires in 2029.
According to a statement from the Department of Health Care Services, the agency that oversees Medi-Cal, all programs “remain federally approved and operational.”
“We appreciate our Medi-Cal providers and community partners, and together we will push full steam ahead to transform our health system and improve health outcomes,” the department said.

Paul Shafer, co-director of the Boston University Medicaid Policy Lab, said decades of public health research show that people have worse health outcomes that require more expensive treatment when their social needs aren’t met.
“We’ve spent the last few decades in public health and health policy, arguing that so much of health and medical costs is driven by environmental factors — people’s living conditions, income, etc.” Shafer said.
But, Shafer said, programs like CalAIM are relatively recent and the research hasn’t had enough time to show whether paying for non-traditional services saves money.
For example, California’s street medicine doctors who take care of people who are homeless say that their patients often cycle in and out of the emergency room — the most expensive point of service in the health care system. They have no place to recover from medical procedures, no address to deliver medications, and the constant exposure to the elements takes years off of their lives, doctors say. 
CalAIM gives them options to help their clients find housing. 
The federal government’s decision not to fund programs like this in the future is a “step backward,” Shafer said. 
“I think we can all read the tea leaves and say that that means they’re sort of unlikely to be renewed,” he said.

Roughly half of all Medi-Cal spending can be attributed to 5% of high-cost users, according to state documents.
But in March, the federal government rescinded guidelines supporting Medi-Cal spending for social services. It also sent states a letter in April indicating that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would no longer approve a funding mechanism that helps support CalAIM, although that money will continue until 2026.
Together, these moves should worry states that operate programs like CalAIM, said Kathy Hempstead, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
“Under the Biden administration states were encouraged to experiment with things like that: To prescribe people prescriptions to get healthy food, to refer people to community-based services,” Hempstead said. “This administration is not receptive at all to … that vision of the Medicaid program.”
In a press release, CMS said it is putting an end to spending that isn’t “directly tied to health care services.”
“Mounting expenditures, such as covering housekeeping for individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or high-speed internet for rural healthcare providers, distracts from the core mission of Medicaid, and in some instances, serves as an overly-creative financing mechanism to skirt state budget responsibilities,” the press release states.
These signals from the federal government apply to future applications for Medicaid changes, and do not change California’s current programs or funding. The state’s CalAIM waiver expires at the end of 2026, and another similar waiver that supports California’s efforts to improve behavioral health care expires in 2029.
According to a statement from the Department of Health Care Services, the agency that oversees Medi-Cal, all programs “remain federally approved and operational.”
“We appreciate our Medi-Cal providers and community partners, and together we will push full steam ahead to transform our health system and improve health outcomes,” the department said.

Paul Shafer, co-director of the Boston University Medicaid Policy Lab, said decades of public health research show that people have worse health outcomes that require more expensive treatment when their social needs aren’t met.
“We’ve spent the last few decades in public health and health policy, arguing that so much of health and medical costs is driven by environmental factors — people’s living conditions, income, etc.” Shafer said.
But, Shafer said, programs like CalAIM are relatively recent and the research hasn’t had enough time to show whether paying for non-traditional services saves money.
For example, California’s street medicine doctors who take care of people who are homeless say that their patients often cycle in and out of the emergency room — the most expensive point of service in the health care system. They have no place to recover from medical procedures, no address to deliver medications, and the constant exposure to the elements takes years off of their lives, doctors say. 
CalAIM gives them options to help their clients find housing. 
The federal government’s decision not to fund programs like this in the future is a “step backward,” Shafer said. 
“I think we can all read the tea leaves and say that that means they’re sort of unlikely to be renewed,” he said.

Amid deteriorating conditions in the current Statehouse, Alabama is pursuing what would be the nation's first new State Capitol in nearly 50 years. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Thursday authorizing the demolition of the Alabama Statehouse.
SB 279, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, gives the Alabama Legislature permission to tear down the current building after relocating to the new Statehouse, anticipated in 2026. The bill passed unanimously and heads to the House for consideration.
“This is the one that deals with the destruction of this fine building right here,” Givhan said to the Senate body.
Givhan said the legislation provides processes for liquidating property that won’t be used in the new Statehouse. The bill states that parts or materials of the current building “may be reused, recycled, upcycled, sold, or disposed of, as determined by the Legislative Council in a manner that is fiscally responsible.” 
The bill would also allow the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to sell furniture that won’t be used in the new building to “members and employees of the Legislature.”
“It just deals with that,” Givhan said.
The bill passed without discussion.
Lawmakers have used the current Statehouse, the old Highway Department building originally intended as a temporary space during Capitol renovations, since 1986. Problems like mold led to the 2023 decision to build a new facility, which will be the nation’s first new statehouse since 1977.

(Photo by Bim/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subcription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers advanced a bill on Thursday creating English-language proficiency and citizenship requirements for commercial drivers utilizing Oklahoma roads. 
Critics said the bill was “drastically” changed from its original topic of the legality of ATVs on some U.S. highways and could harm businesses.
Senate Bill 20, authored by Rep. Jonathan Wilk, R-Goldsby, moved through the House committee along a party line vote. The new language would require anyone operating a commercial motor vehicle in the state to have a “sufficient proficiency” in the English language and a valid commercial license from the United States, or from Canada and Mexico with a valid work visa. Drivers must also carry proof of citizenship for the country that issued the license. 
It also prohibits people who hold certain tourism and business visas from operating commercial motor vehicles in the state. Penalties for violations of the bill range from $2,000 to $5,000 fines and vehicles being impounded. 
A commercial driver’s license allows a motorist to operate specialized vehicles like buses or semi-trucks. A commercial motor vehicle refers to any motor vehicle used in interstate commerce to transport property or passengers, with specific weight and passenger limits. 
Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, said the new language was a “drastic change from the original bill and the original intent” of the measure.
This bill could be a burden on businesses and force them to drive around Oklahoma rather than travel through the state, Alonso-Sandoval said. 
Wilk, the bill author, said it’s a “due burden” to ensure businesses operate “right” with “qualified and safe drivers.”
He said this is a “public safety” bill that is intended to protect residents and anyone using Oklahoma’s roads. Traffic fatalities had increased since federal rules were amended to allow states to waive some commercial driver testing requirements, he said. A National Safety Council analysis shows the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes has increased slightly since 2016.  
A 2016 memo from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration removed the requirement to “place drivers out of service” who have “English Language Proficiency violations,” and changed the agency’s standard for determining non-compliance.
An Arkansas-based trucking association has been backing a measure in Arkansas similar to Wilk’s and attributed a rise in fatal crashes involving large trucks partly to the 2016 federal policy change. They said more nondomiciled commercial licenses are being issued to drivers with lower qualifications. 
While Wilk said he hasn’t spoken to any Oklahoma-based trucking associations, he said truckers in his district requested the measure. 
The bill doesn’t prohibit licensed drivers from other states from coming through Oklahoma, he said. 
Rep. Annie Menz, D-Norman, said the language changes still “merit” more consideration and asked Wilk to stall it. 
“You should still feel empowered to want to work on it more if you want to, because like I said, your name is on it,” she said. “It’s something that your name is on. The people of your district, their name is on it through that. So would you be willing to, no pun intended, park it here in this lovely committee … to be able to work on the language?”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The Senate voted Thursday to codify Gov. Ron DeSantis’ faith and community initiative amid scrutiny of the initiative’s former leader’s involvement in campaigning against the unsuccessful abortion-rights amendment.
Senators’ 27-9 vote to ensure that an office of faith and community would remain in the executive branch after DeSantis’ term ends came a week after it became known that the initiative’s liaison had stepped down to lead an anti-abortion policy council.
Although all Republicans voted for the bill, SB 820, two also supported an amendment from Boca Raton Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky prohibiting the liaison from participating in political campaigns while on duty and using the office to influence people’s votes.
Polsky read emails from Erik Dellenback, the former liaison, sent to faith leaders across the state advocating against the amendment to protect abortion access under the governor’s masthead. Polsky brought up Dellenback’s remarks framing the abortion-rights amendment as a biblical issue during an event held by Florida Family Voice, the group he’s now CEO of.
“We’ve seen the abuse in this last election cycle of using the governor’s office, using state agencies, and using this office of faith and community to promote a particular viewpoint, and you can’t say it’s not political,” Polsky said. Her amendment failed.
Former Senate President Don Gaetz and Miami Republican Sen. Alexis Calatayud voted for Polsky’s amendment.
Dellenback left both his role with the faith and community initiative and as executive director of Hope Florida. News of the resignation emerged as the House deepened its probe into the Hope Florida Foundation, the charity associated with First Lady Casey DeSantis’ initiative.
Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough, who’s sponsoring the proposal, said that the Florida Supreme Court dismissed a complaint over state officials’ involvement against the abortion-rights amendment. The court said the attorney who filed the suit lacked standing to do so as a civilian.
“My opinion on the issue is not relevant to the bill that’s before us,” Yarborough said regarding how he felt about the emails Dellenback had sent.
However, Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo said that DeSantis’ influence makes it impossible for Floridians to file complaints against government officials, pointing out that the governor appointed his former chief of staff, James Uthmeier, as the new attorney general.
“There’s not even a lieutenant governor to try to reason with,” Pizzo said. “Right now, in the four corners of Florida, where is the ability to redress or have recourse of your grievance?”
The House bill, HB 293, has cleared all of its committee stops but has not been scheduled for a House vote.

Gavin Newsom reset his relationship with President Donald Trump after the Los Angeles fires, but he has yet to secure the disaster aid he wants. Now new political pressures are pushing California’s governor back into confrontation with Trump.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom reset his relationship with President Donald Trump after the Los Angeles fires, but he has yet to secure the disaster aid he wants. Now new political pressures are pushing California’s governor back into confrontation with Trump.


Three months into President Donald Trump’s second term and the recovery from the firestorm that devastated Los Angeles, Gov. Gavin Newsom finds himself at a precarious juncture.
The olive branch that Newsom extended to Trump in January, as Los Angeles reeled from multiple fires and the president threatened to withhold disaster aid, has yet to deliver on its early promise.
Once a leading voice in the anti-Trump resistance, Newsom traveled to Los Angeles and then Washington, D.C. to meet with the president and lobby for federal assistance. Trump rewarded his outreach with a détente — ceasing reference to the governor as “Newscum” and publicly promising that an “L.A. fire fix” was coming.
But amid ongoing battles over government funding, Congress has to date ignored Newsom’s request for $40 billion to rebuild Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, new political pressures are mounting. Increasingly furious with Trump’s dismantling of the federal government, Democratic voters are agitating their leaders to speak out — and even Newsom can no longer hold his tongue.
He made his most pointed criticism of the president’s agenda since before the fires when he sued last week to stop Trump’s sweeping tariffs scheme, calling it the “poster child” of stupidity. It appears to have unleashed Newsom’s confrontational side again, in a semi-profane announcement of another lawsuit to stop cuts to AmeriCorps and a commentary blasting the Trump administration for defying court orders that followed in the days after.
The stakes are incredibly high, not only for the future of Los Angeles but also for his gubernatorial legacy.
A policy shift that is ‘beyond alarming’
Newsom has sought to strike a balance that can protect his relationship with the president, whose backing will be critical to get any aid package through the Republican-controlled Congress. As he leans anew into the opposition, Newsom is training his ire on the Trump administration while largely avoiding mentioning Trump himself.
“We never want to make this personal. This is about protecting our values,” said Bob Salladay, the governor’s senior communications adviser.
But Salladay said the threats from the president, particularly the tariffs that could upend California’s entire economy, have reached DEFCON 2. Newsom can no longer sit out the fight, despite his ongoing prioritization of securing disaster aid for Los Angeles.
“There’s been a tone shift because there has been a policy shift from D.C. that is beyond alarming,” Salladay said.
It’s not the first time Newsom has had to find a way to set aside differences with his political nemesis for a state in turmoil.
Two days after Newsom won the governorship in 2018 with a campaign that made Trump his primary foil, the deadliest wildfire in California history tore through the town of Paradise. In between filing dozens of lawsuits against the federal government, Newsom also worked closely with Trump to guide California through the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
But working with the president has become more complex than ever, said Mark Ghilarducci, who served as director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services from 2012 to 2022. While Trump always struggled to understand the complexities of disasters and provide an empathetic response, he’s become “very extreme in his second term,” Ghilarducci said.

In his first term, Ghilarducci said, Trump’s impulses were tempered by other high-ranking officials who were reasonable and experienced — experts with authority whom California could engage to ultimately to get what it needed.
When Trump rejected a major disaster declaration request in October 2020 for six wildfires burning across California, Ghilarducci said the Newsom administration made the case that the decision mostly hurt counties that supported the president and he promptly reversed himself.
“Now it’s really just slash and burn and destroy,” Ghilarducci said. “He’s surrounded by people who are much more enablers and sycophants.”
Ghilarducci said the political environment is the most challenging he’s seen in his four-decade career in disaster response. As Trump gleefully punishes his political enemies, his administration is eliminating departments and programs that would facilitate Los Angeles’ recovery, and Congress can barely pull together enough votes to keep the government funded.
“It’s something where you need a lot of savvy, strategic, thoughtful tradecraft to be able to navigate all the twists and turns,” he said.
Wildfire funds in the hands of Congress
The Newsom administration remains hopeful that Congress will approve a supplemental disaster relief package by this summer. Its $40 billion wish list includes money for debris removal, public infrastructure repair, housing reconstruction, economic development grants and small business loans.
The governor’s office could not provide a comprehensive list of disasters for which California has previously received supplemental disaster relief and how long it took to get the money. But a funding bill that furnished money to recover from the Camp Fire passed in June 2019, about seven months after the blaze ignited.
The bipartisan team of Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla and GOP Rep. Ken Calvert of Corona, with California’s entire congressional delegation behind them, is leading the push on Capitol Hill. Early demands to condition aid to Los Angeles on unrelated policies such as water management and voter identification appear to be waning, especially as discussions around a funding bill have broadened to incorporate subsequent disasters in red and purple states, including floods in Kentucky and wildfires in North Carolina.   
“From wildfires in California, to hurricanes in the Southeast, natural disasters do not distinguish between red states and blue states, and neither should our support for fellow Americans in their time of need,” Padilla said in a statement. “I will continue to push for additional disaster funding at every possible opportunity. I will also do everything I can to maintain bipartisan support for delivering additional relief for our state.”
Until then, California has a few more months of fiscal runway, because of a generous major disaster declaration that then-President Joe Biden signed immediately after the Los Angeles fires in January. That order authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse 100% of the costs for cleanup, hazard mitigation and financial assistance for survivors for 180 days. After that, 75% of eligible emergency response costs are reimbursed.
But that account will eventually run out of money, requiring Congress to act to fund a longer-term recovery for Los Angeles.
“Just as all disasters are unique, requests to Congress and timelines are too,” Monica Vargas, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, wrote in an email. “Helping survivors and communities recover remains California’s priority.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021825-LA-FIRE-NEWSOM-JG-AP-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 15:15:52.595620

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Former Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly is making moves indicating that he is close to entering the Democratic race for Florida governor in 2026.
As first reported by Politico Thursday morning, Jolly, a political independent for the past seven years, registered as a Democrat Wednesday and simultaneously launched a state political committee, enabling him to begin raising money for a potential candidacy.
A former aide to Pinellas GOP Congressman C.W. “Bill” Young, Jolly served for nearly three years in Congress (2014-2017) before becoming a national figure as a cable news analyst for MSNBC.
As an indication of his intentions, Jolly has hired Democratic campaign strategist Eric Hyers as an adviser. Among the successful campaigns Hyers has been involved was Montana Gov. Steve Bullock’s re-election victory in 2016. That was the same year Donald Trump won that state by more than 20 percentage points.
“Eric Hyers has proven that he can help elect Democratic candidates in gubernatorial races in either red states or red-wave elections,” Jolly said. “And he may be the most talented political professional in the country today, so I’m excited that he’s agreed to advise on the entire 2026 cycle, and that includes whether I become a candidate or not.”
Jolly has been attending Democratic town-hall meetings since he announced that he was considering a run for governor a month ago, and he says those meetings have encouraged him to step back into the political arena. The intensity displayed in these events in reaction to the first months of the second iteration of a Trump presidency shows that Democrats have a chance to win back voters disaffected by the party in recent years, he said.
“Democrats are turning out and they’re showing up and they want to be active,” he said, adding that he has been asking for a show of hands of people who have never previously attended such events.
“Usually about a third of the audience is a first-time attendee, which shows that new voters and new converts, if you will, are excited about the Democratic Party. I will tell you that it is an enthusiastic Democratic party right now,” he said. “We talk openly about my prospects of running for governor, and I am incredibly encouraged by the kindness and the support that I get at these town halls, and obviously that goes into my decision making.”
Praise for Donalds
Republicans around the country have faced hostile crowds when they’ve hosted town halls this year, leading top GOP officials such as House Speaker Mike Johnson to advise that they don’t attend them.
One Republican member of Congress who hasn’t shown a reluctance to engage with his voters is Byron Donalds, the biggest name so far to enter the 2026 sweepstakes for governor in Florida. Jolly says that’s admirable.
“I commend Bryon Donalds for holding town halls,” he said. “I saw [Southeast Florida Republican Congressman] Brian Mast just had three, and one of the asks in these town halls is where is our member of Congress? And so kudos to Byron Donalds for showing up and having the conversation.”
The former Republican says he’s been watching closely the allegations over the past month regarding the Hope Florida Foundation, nonprofit arm of Hope Florida, the welfare assistance program connected to First Lady Casey DeSantis.
“We’ve already codified corruption in the state statute to allow it in many areas,” Jolly said. “Remarkably, this may be an area where the governor and First Lady have gone too far and even acted outside of what type of corruption is already allowed.”
Jolly has said that if he does enter the contest, the affordability crisis in the Sunshine State will be front and center of his candidacy. He also wants to talk about gun safety, which is back in the headlines following the shootings last week at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
“I think leaders sometimes have to lead in shaping public opinion and taking hard positions when you know it’s right. And you know, if you look at the website — and I’ve said this many times on TV — I support an assault weapons ban. 
“I think we need comprehensive and universal background checks, and what I mean by that is universal means every transaction — between families, gun shows, you name it. But comprehensive means more than what we’re currently checking. We basically currently check for a criminal conviction. I support the red flag laws. I think we should expand the Parkland package that was passed and what some Republicans want to roll back. I just think we need leaders to lead on reducing gun violence. It’s not that hard.”
Whomever the Democrats nominate as their gubernatorial choice in 2026, that candidate will be an decided underdog, as Republicans have won races for governor, senator, and president by more than double digits over the past two election cycles.
Republicans scoff
Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power scoffed at the news that Jolly has joined the Democratic Party.
“It’s good to know Never Trumper and failed MSNBC analyst has found his true home in the irrelevant @FlaDems.” Power wrote on X. “I welcome him to run for Governor, the nearly 40% of the electorate that voted for @CharlieCrist deserve an equally bad choice this cycle.”
Leon County Democratic Executive Committee Chair Ryan Ray said that he welcomed Jolly to the Democratic Party and called it a “great sign of the emerging 2026 Democratic midterm wave that MAGA is already alienating longtime Republicans like David Jolly, turned off by the Constitutional chaos and economic damage of MAGA.”
Ryan wondered, however, how much support there might be for Jolly from elements of the party.
“Personally, I’ll be looking for a candidate with a longer track record of standing up against GOP extremism,” he said in a text message. “Party switchers have historically not won.”
Jolly said last month that he’ll likely announce his candidacy before June. “I remain very serious about it and will make a decision around Memorial Day, but certainly it is under the strongest possible consideration.”

Board members Chris Vandenhende, Mike Tinney and Ryan Deatherage said during a meeting Thursday that state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who leads the board, had not informed them of significant changes made to the social studies standards before the board approved them Feb. 27. The approval vote sent the changed draft to the state Legislature for review.
Walters said he is responsible for new language added to the standards, some of which suggest there were “discrepancies” in 2020 presidential election results, but he rejected allegations that the board members weren’t provided the updated version in advance. If approved, the standards will dictate what topics public schools must teach to students in social studies courses.
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday encouraged state lawmakers to take action on the proposed social studies standards while raising doubts about the integrity of the approval process. Deatherage has said he wants another chance to review and vote on the standards.
Vandenhende, Tinney and Deatherage, whom Stitt appointed in February, said they felt deceived and described the last-minute changes as a “bait and switch.” They complained they didn’t receive a copy of public comments on the standards nor were they given a red-lined draft showing what had changed in the text.

“It would have never dawned on me somebody would have changed them without telling the board whose duty it is to adopt them,” Tinney said during Thursday’s meeting.
Walters denied allegations the governor made Wednesday that the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed the board members a different version of the standards from what the board ultimately passed. He called the matter a “fake controversy.”
“This was created by board members saying things outwardly, publicly that are simply not true,” Walters told the board, setting off a back-and-forth argument with the three new members.
Records the state Education Department provided indicate the board members were emailed the final version of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before their Feb. 27 meeting, which started at 9:30 a.m. 
Deatherage was the only board member to vote against the standards, saying during the February meeting he didn’t have enough time to review the lengthy document. He suggested delaying the vote by a week, but other board members disagreed.

“I really had no idea what’s in there,” Deatherage said Thursday. “I was not given time to go through those standards at that board meeting. I’m not a speed reader by any means.”
Walters said his administration provided the updated version in advance but he couldn’t make the board members read it. Delaying the February vote, he said, would have limited the time the state Legislature would have to review the standards.
Tinney said he read the original draft of the standards that the state agency posted in December for the public comment period. He said he didn’t know until after the Feb. 27 vote that the final draft was considerably different from the original version. 
Vandenhende said if he were aware of what he knows now, he would have voted against the standards. 
“The process is not a good process,” Vandenhende said.
The proposal would have failed to pass from the six-member board if Tinney and Vandenhende had joined Deatherage in voting against it in February.
Although public comments routinely inspire adjustments to agency proposals, the Education Department didn’t acknowledge any changes had been made to the standards after the public comment period nor did it publicly post the final draft until weeks after the board meeting.

The updated version suggests there were “discrepancies” in election results in 2020, including the “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
Walters said the language isn’t intended to support or deny the outcome of the 2020 presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, but rather to encourage students to come to their own conclusions.
The original version of the standards made headlines by introducing Bible stories and teachings of Jesus that “influenced the American founders and culture.” The state’s current standards, enacted in 2019, make no mention of the Bible or Jesus.
Academic standards are reviewed and updated on a six-year cycle. They impact the topics taught in Oklahoma classrooms and the textbooks the state approves.
GOP majority in state Legislature unlikely to reject the standards
Despite the controversy, the standards appear to be on track to pass as written through the state Legislature. Leaders of the state House and Senate said their Republican majorities are unlikely to reject them.
Lawmakers have the option to approve, deny or amend the standards. If they take no action by May 1, the standards pass as written.

It “doesn’t look likely” that lawmakers will take a vote on the standards, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said Thursday.
“We’ve certainly had members digging into it and looking at it, but ultimately when you look at the standards themselves, we didn’t have consensus on items that we would want to revise or send back, at least not not at this point,” Hilbert said.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said the GOP majority in his chamber also is unlikely to reject the proposal.
Democrats in both chambers have filed resolutions to deny the standards in full.
Hilbert said he spoke with Walters on Wednesday night for an explanation of whether the board members received the final draft of the standards before approving them. He said Walters gave proof they received the updated version before voting.
“We vetted it pretty heavily, and we cannot find distinction between what the board received and what was ultimately voted on,” Hilbert said.
While raising questions about the inner workings of the standards approval process, Stitt alleged the Education Department emailed board members a different version from what their physical board packets contained.
“I think ultimately, I’m not saying those (standards) are good or bad,” Stitt said during a news conference Wednesday. “The Legislature’s going to have to make a decision on that, but the mechanics of how it came about really just feels — it feels like somebody needs to look into it, and we’re trying.”

(Photo by Manuel Balce Ceneta-Pool/Getty Images)A graduate student from the Republic of Ghana studying in central New Mexico says the U.S. government’s termination of his student status violates federal law and his constitutional right to due process.
The doctoral student and research assistant, identified only as K.O.D. in court records, moved to Socorro in August 2023, where he has been studying petrochemical engineering at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, according to court records. He received his bachelor’s degree at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in his home country and his master’s at the Politencnico di Torino in Italy, his attorneys wrote.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on April 9 abruptly terminated the student’s status in the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) system, court records state. This means he faces potential immigration detention and deportation, his attorneys wrote.
“Losing my F-1 status puts my education, research, and career trajectory at risk, and I fear being forced to leave the country before I can complete by Ph.D. program,” the student wrote in a sworn statement included in court records. “This sudden disruption has made me feel vulnerable and anxious, not only about my immediate situation but also about the stability and direction of my life in the years to come.”
The student is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Shayne Huffman, an Albuquerque-based civil rights attorney, who on Wednesday filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico.
Both filings name Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons as defendants.
The motion for a temporary restraining order asks the court to block Noem and Lyons from terminating the student’s F-1 student status under the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) system.
“At the most elemental level, the United States Constitution requires notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard,” his attorneys wrote. “No such process was provided here with respect to the termination of student status.”
Huffman told Source NM the government hasn’t put forward any evidence to justify terminating his client’s student status.
“We believe that there can be no more egregious violation of someone’s due process than what has happened to our client, and for the other students that this has happened to as well,” Huffman said.
As of Thursday, the U.S. government has changed the legal status of more than 1,800 international students at more than 280 colleges and universities, including at least 10 in New Mexico, according to Inside Higher Ed.
DHS didn’t notify the New Mexico Tech student or his school, his attorneys wrote. He learned about the agency’s action against him when the school’s international programs coordinator informed him that they had discovered his student status had been terminated.
The reason given on the record of termination was “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked,” according to a copy included in the restraining order motion.
However, the student has no criminal record, “without even minor infractions such as a traffic or parking violation,” has shown no violence in the U.S. or elsewhere and hasn’t participated in any protest either in-person or online, his attorneys wrote. Huffman said he has never faced any disciplinary action from the school whatsoever.
“It’s entirely unclear to us as to why he was targeted,” Huffman said.
Source NM left a voicemail for a New Mexico Tech spokesperson, and we will update this story as necessary.

DHS has effectively disenrolled the student from his Ph.D. program and he can no longer work as a research assistant, which puts him in financial jeopardy because his financial aid, which is contingent on participation in the Ph.D. program, has been suspended, Huffman and ACLU-NM Senior Staff Attorney Becca Sheff wrote.
The status termination also prevents him from making progress in his doctoral program and obtaining his Ph.D., his attorneys wrote.
Twelve days after the student learned about DHS’ action, the school gave him a notice of “Graduate Contract Change or Cancellation,” saying his graduate contract was being terminated due to “immigration status currently revoked” by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
His attorneys wrote he likely accrues unlawful presence in the U.S. each day, which threatens his chance of reinstating his F-1 student status in the future.
The student is not challenging the revocation of his F-1 visa but, rather, is challenging DHS’s unlawful termination of his F-1 student status in the SEVIS system, his attorneys wrote. An F-1 student visa refers only to the document an immigrant student receives to enter the U.S., while F-1 student status refers to students’ formal immigration classification in the U.S. once they enter the country, they wrote.
The student lawfully obtained a visitor visa to attend a petroleum engineers’ conference in the U.S. in 2016 but customs officials didn’t let him in for five years.
“Just as the 2016 denial did not prevent Plaintiff from lawfully obtaining an F-1 visa in 2023, it cannot now serve as a legitimate basis for terminating his current status,” his attorneys wrote.
The student’s research is his passion and he has dedicated his entire life for the last two years to it, Huffman said, having authored or co-authored at least half a dozen publications and traveled the country to present at academic conferences.
“We’re a state that’s so reliant on energy, and he’s pushing forward the research in an area that directly impacts the state,” Huffman said.
Huffman said there are other Ghanaian students at New Mexico Tech. The school in October 2023 entered into an agreement with the student’s former school in Ghana to strengthen their petroleum engineering programs.
“With all the students that this is happening to, international students ultimately are a net positive for this country,” Huffman said. “They’re here to contribute in meaningful ways. They’re here to push research forward in the sciences or any other field. Our country and our state are better off with these international students here making their contributions.”

Hecklers interrupted a speech Thursday by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at a conference on opioid addiction in Nashville.
The Rx and Illicit Drug Summit 2025 drew law enforcement officials, addiction prevention counselors, social workers and public health officers to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center for the three-day event. 
For years, Kennedy has drawn ire and disapproval for his anti-vaccine messages and, more recently, for belittling comments about people with autism and budget cuts in his department. 
“Believe science!,” shouted a protester before security rushed him from the room.Another protester held aloft a sign that read, “Vaccines save lives.”
Kennedy’s speech was apolitical and focused on his own history in recovery from an addiction to heroin and his recommendations for dealing with the nation’s opioid crisis — many of which focused less on medical or treatment solutions and more on the need to build community, embrace spirituality and take personal responsibility.
After touting a $4 billion budget at HHS, Kennedy said that “money alone won’t fix this.”
“We have a whole generation of children who have lost faith in our country and their future,” Kennedy said. “Policy should reestablish hope for the future.” 
Alexis Pleus of Binghamton, New York, and another woman unfurled a banner saying “Cuts Kill” before being ejected. 
Pleus, who came to Nashville with other members of a group called Moms United to End the War on Drugs, lost her son to a drug overdose and said budget cuts at HHS spurred her attendance.

The Trump administration — and Kennedy — have proposed to restructure HHS, including dismantling the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), cutting research funding and funding for addiction treatment and mental health care. 
“All these changes are impacting people on the ground,” Pleus said. “People who are struggling with addiction can’t get help already and now they’re going to have an even harder time.”
The conference was sponsored by HMP Global, which provides continuing medical education. 
Past speakers have included former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump spoke to the group in 2019 during his first term in office. 
In addition to Kennedy, 2025 speakers included U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Tennessee senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Dr. Ralph Alvarado, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health.

Ron DeSantis speaking in St. Augustine on April 23, 2025.A high-profile inquiry by the Florida House into a charity associated with an initiative started by First Lady Casey DeSantis has abruptly come to an end, at least for now.
The investigation concerned a $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation from health care giant Centene, but a top Republican said the chamber had learned enough to inform policy decisions the body needs to make during the regular legislative session.
The decision came after a trio of people Andrade asked to appear before the committee on Thursday refused to show — which he attributed to fear, given the stakes.
“$10 millions is a lot of money in the real world, right? If someone defrauded the state or a charity out of $10 million, they would go to prison,” he said.
The Hope Florida Foundation is a direct-service organization that helps serve the Hope Florida program, which aims to remove people from Medicaid and food assistance by connecting them with “navigators” in state agencies who work with faith-based communities and other private sector efforts to transition people to financial security.
Andrade, chairman of the House Health Care Budget Committee, said the House did not intend to subpoena anyone or force delivery of requested information. “Everyone and their mother knows what happened,” he told reporters.
 He criticized Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was chief of staff for Gov. Ron DeSantis at the time the foundation got the money that it subsequently sent to two political committees that then made substantial donations to a third committee battling a citizens’ to legalize marijuana. Uthmeier controlled the third committee, Keep Florida Clean.
The transactions were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald.
“I’m a legislator making policy decisions, and I’m comfortable making the policy decisions based on the fact that James Uthmeier was involved, transferred this money illicitly, misled people and lied to people in the process, harmed several people in their jobs in the process, caused innumerable harm to several people, and that harm is not fully realized yet.”

Andrade had invited Mark Wilson, president and CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and chair of Secure Florida’s Future; Amy Ronshausen, executive director of Save Our Society From Drugs; and Tallahassee attorney and Hope Florida Foundation legal counsel Jeff Aaron to appear at the meeting but none showed.










Ten million dollars is a lot of money in the real world, right? If someone defrauded the state or a charity out of $10 million they would go to prison.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


The $10 million came from health care giant Centene in settlement of a legal dispute over overpayments of Medicaid pharmacy benefits. It was part of a larger $67 million settlement with the state in September 2024.
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris insisted that the $10 million wasn’t taxpayer money, but rather a donation in addition to the settlement payment, and so have other DeSantis officials.
Appearing at a press conference at a church in St. Augustine, DeSantis didn’t comment on the dropped investigation. Instead, he and First Lady Casey DeSantis touted the Hope Florida program once again, asserting that it has helped more than 30,000 Floridians reduce or completely eliminate their reliance on public assistance.
They asserted that the program would save taxpayers “over $100 million a year.” They have provided no documentation proving that, however. 
Casey DeSantis spoke extensively about the work done by Hope Florida, including  with the faith-based community. “What we are doing is good,” she said. “What we are doing is just. Sometimes you have to put on the full armor of God and you fight, because you know what you’re doing is righteous.”
Her only direct reference to the growing controversy was to say, “No matter what is written, don’t ever let politics get in the way of purpose.”
When asked by a reporter to comment about whether the $10 million came from Medicaid dollars, the governor said that documents released earlier this week by the the Florida AHCA “totally debunks the bogus media narratives that were out there.” 
“Why are they doing narrative?” he asked he said of news organizations. “They’re not doing it because they really care about that,” he said. “They’re doing it to try to impugn Hope Florida. They’re trying to smear this program. They don’t like working with the faith based community.”

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryFrom building party infrastructure and strengthening candidate recruitment pipelines to supporting current candidates with tens of thousands in cash, both the Democratic Party of Virginia and candidates running in this year’s pivotal House of Delegates election are getting fresh infusions of funds and energy from national organizations. 
Thursday, the Democratic National Committee announced that it will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years. Meanwhile the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced its spotlight investment on a slate of Democrats who are challenging Republican incumbents in Virginia’s statehouse.
Women candidates pack Virginia’s House of Delegates elections, tee up historic governor’s race

Those include women candidates who are facing a rematch this year against Republican incumbents they nearly ousted last time around. Those races are expected to be tight again as Republicans try to hold the line and Democrats hope to flip the districts. 
House District 82 challenger Kimberly Pope Adams lost to Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg in 2023’s election by just 53 votes and will face the delegate again with DLCC’s backing. 
As will House District 41 challenger Lily Franklin who nearly beat Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, and House District 71 challenger Jessica Anderson who nearly ousted Del. Amanda Batten, R- James City County. Both women will step up to bat again in November. 
DLCC also announced support for House District 22 challenger Elizabeth Guzman, a former state delegate looking to get back into the legislature by ousting Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, in the competitive district.
During Guzman’s previous tenure in the General Assembly she was tapped to deliver the Spanish language response to Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address during his first term in the White House. 
Now that he’s earned a second term and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Virginia’s House of Delegates and state executive branch elections this year represent an opportunity for Democrats to hold onto their seats and claw back power at the state level.
DLCC pours money into Virginia races, citing ‘All eyes on 2025’

With $350,000 already invested in Virginia specifically as one of its priority states, DLCC plans to build on that number. 
“State Democrats in Virginia and across the country are holding the line against extremism in Washington,” DLCC president Heather Williams said in a statement. “All eyes should be on the commonwealth as competitive campaigns ramp up and voters prepare to hold Republicans accountable for their extremism this November.”
The focus on state-level gains is paramount for the party’s national apparatus as well. 
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” DNC chair Ken Martin told the media during a virtual call Wednesday morning. 
As part of the new investment strategy, he said that each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month — up $5,000 from the current baseline. Republican-controlled states can also expect a total of $22,500 per month with a boost from the DNC’s Red State Fund. 
A politically purple state, this doesn’t apply to Virginia this time around, as the threshold for that funding source entails meeting at least two of three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; one-quarter or less of the state’s congressional delegation being made up of Democrats; and Republicans holding supermajorities in both state legislative chambers. 
Those factors are in flux, Martin and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who was also on the call, emphasized, saying “there’s no such thing as a perpetual blue state or a perpetual red state.”
But in order to build Democratic gains within the D.C. beltway, Martin said, the DNC can help support states as they recruit and support candidates in bodies like state legislatures and city councils. 
“The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere,” Martin said. 
With the fresh boosts from the DNC and DLCC, Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Lamont Bagby is ready to put the resources to work in this year’s elections. 
“We are committed to investing in every corner of the Commonwealth and mobilizing every voter to elect Abigail Spanberger as Governor, a Democratic Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, and expand our majority in the House of Delegates,” he said in a statement to The Mercury.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable – 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Mike Kehoe withdrew the nomination of Tom Prater to the State Board of Education on Thursday after concerns circulated from a national advocacy group and a state senator.
Prater, a Springfield eye surgeon who donated $21,000 to Kehoe’s political action committee last year, was appointed in an interim capacity following the retirement of 33-year board member Peter Herschend. He was reappointed by Kehoe this year alongside three new board members.
But in the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing Wednesday, his selection was singled out by Republican state Sen. Mike Moon.
Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, said his constituents had complained about Prater’s appointment. He asked Prater about his role in United Springfield, a committee that has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle in local elections.
Prater said the group didn’t look at political affiliations but asked questions about “education issues.”
Moon told The Independent on Thursday he spoke to Kehoe about his concerns but didn’t want to talk more about Prater or the reasons his nomination was withdrawn
If the Senate had voted Prater’s nomination down, he would have been banned from serving on the board for life. Instead, the nomination was withdrawn shortly after the Senate convened Thursday and the other education board nominee, Republican Brooks Miller, was confirmed on a voice vote. 
A spokeswoman for Kehoe did not respond to a request for comment. 
The State Board of Education, by law, can’t be dominated by a political party. Prater was nominated as an independent, with the maximum number of Republicans already in office or appointed.
Prater has a history of donating to both Republican and Democratic candidates, with the majority of his contributions benefiting those on the political right.
These donations came under scrutiny from the American Accountability Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit committed to the “American First conservative agenda,” according to its social media.
“If you want a pro-tax, anti-voucher, pro-teacher union voice on the State Board of Education, then Tom Prater is your guy,” the organization’s founder, Thomas Jones, said in an email to state officials Wednesday. “But if you want reform-minded conservatives, you’re going to need a new nominee.”
Jones noted Prater’s donations to ActBlue, which received $250 from Prater last year, and donations to local Democrats often below $1,000. 
Jones told The Independent Thursday that any donations to blue candidates are “terrible.”
“He shouldn’t be on the board at all,” he said. “He has donated to a bunch of terrible liberals in your state. He is going to be a toxic influence on the Board of Education.”
Missouri-based groups Freedom Principle MO and MO Education Watch celebrated the withdrawal on social media.
“The people won,” MO Education Watch said on X, formerly Twitter.
Prater did not respond to a request for comment.

Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, seeks to study improvements to “passenger transportation service and public transit”A resolution for an interim study of public transportation moved forward in the House on Wednesday, passing a second reading vote 51-49.
Senate Joint Resolution 19, brought by Sen. Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, seeks to study improvements to “passenger transportation service and public transit” with the requirement it’s reported during the next legislative session.
The resolution said some communities are poorly served by transit and that in general, public transportation is on the decline in Montana. It also specifically notes the state’s elderly population and issues with distance between where someone lives and their medical appointments.
“Basically the study looks at ways to improve passenger transportation, whether that’s air, bus, train, vehicle services, identifying where the need is and looks to further enhance and improve that so we stay connected as a community across the state,” said Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings during a House floor session on Tuesday.

Baum is carrying the legislation in the House. She also carried legislation this session seeking to use railroad tax money to help fund the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority. 
That bill failed in the Senate after lobbying efforts and questions around viability doomed the legislation. Just a handful of bills this session have touched on public transportation.
House Bill 764, brought by Rep. Brian Close, D-Bozeman changed the process of how urban transportation districts are created and expanded. 
The bill passed both chambers and would add a stipulation that anytime county commissioners want to expand a transportation district, a map of the proposed district would have to be added. It also adds language to the law making it easier for property owners in urban transportation districts but not receiving services to get out of them.

(U.S. Attorney's Office)Federal prosecutors announced new charges against three people in the Pittsburgh area, including a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. They are accused of conspiring to vandalize a synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood and build improvised bombs.
Mohamad Hamad, 23, of Coraopolis and Talya A. Lubit, 24, of Pittsburgh were originally charged in November with conspiracy and defacing a religious building.
The new charges, made public in an indictment filed Tuesday, include a third defendant, Micaiah Collins, 22, of Pittsburgh, who is accused of conspiring with Hamad to make and set off homemade explosives. Attorneys for the three defendants, who were released after posting bonds, did not return calls Thursday.
Hamad, who enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 2023, is also accused of lying about his allegiances to Palestine and Lebanon during a military background investigation and possessing destructive devices.
The vandalism of Chabad of Squirrel Hill and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh with anti-Semitic graffiti last July came about six years after a gunman killed 11 people worshiping inside the nearby Tree of Life building, which houses two synagogues.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the indictment, Hamad and Lubit discussed plans to paint graffiti on “Jewish institutions” over the messaging app Signal in late July. Hamad purchased a can of red spray paint and met with Lubit early in the morning on July 29. They drove in Hamad’s car to Chabad where Lubit got out and painted “Jews 4 Palestine” on the front of the synagogue, the indictment says.
Lubit also painted an inverted red triangle, which the indictment alleges is a symbol used by the terrorist organization, Hamas, to designate a building as a target. On the same morning, the Jewish Federation reported to Pittsburgh police that its sign had been vandalized with a red spray-paint message that it “funds genocide” and “ Jesus, Hate Zionists.”
According to the indictment, Hamad was assigned to the 171st Maintenance Squadron based with the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 171st Air Refueling Wing in Moon Township, near the Pittsburgh International Airport.
As part of his duties in the squadron, Hamad sought a top-secret security clearance. He was interviewed in-person three times and allegedly made false statements about his allegiance to the United States. The indictment details how, during the background investigation, Hamad made numerous statements online that he was more loyal to Palestine and Lebanon than the United States.
It also says Hamad shared violent pro-Hamas videos and ordered clothing with the image of a Hamas leader and the message “Respect Resistance or Expect Resistance.” He also stated his desire to travel to Palestine to join the resistance against Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
In June, about a month before the graffiti incidents, Hamad started discussions with Collins using the encrypted messaging app Signal about building bombs. He also ordered chemicals and materials online and purchased a fuse at a fireworks store to build explosive devices, the indictment says.
In early July, Hamad drove from Pittsburgh to State College with the devices he had built. He and another person who is not charged or identified in the indictment drove to Rothrock State Park where they detonated the devices, the indictment says.

StebbinsAs Michigan works to build out its clean energy infrastructure to meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040, panelists at the 2025 MI Healthy Climate Conference sat down to discuss the steps — and the hurdles — in achieving Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goal of generating 60% of the state’s power from renewables by 2030. 
When looking at the biggest challenges in shifting Michigan’s energy grid away from fossil fuels to sources like wind and solar, energy developers and solar energy proponents focused on community sentiments as the biggest stumbling block.
Chris Kunkle, the vice president of government affairs for Virginia-based Apex Clean Energy, said the clean energy industry is facing a lot of headwinds from the federal government particularly during a time when energy demand is rising quickly.

However, energy policy is largely determined at the state level, Kunkle said, with Michigan’s 2023 clean energy package helping to alleviate previous difficulties in securing permits, allowing energy developers to pursue permitting at the state level if a municipality fails to approve or deny their application within a timely manner, or if local zoning boards either adopt standards stricter than the health and safety standards outlined in the law, or if they deny an application that complies with the standards outlined in the law.

“We were thrilled to see the state Legislature come up with a really novel approach where you’re required to try to go through the local process — and quite prescriptive about what that looks like —and if that falls apart for whatever reason, there’s an alternative route to go through the state and receive a permit,” Kunkle said. 
But, just like renewable developments in rural communities, these bills were hotly debated in the Legislature, as Republicans argued they stripped away local control in the zoning process. 
While the bills ultimately passed along party lines in the previous Democratic-led House and Senate, Republicans have since taken control of the House and Rep. Gregory Alexander (R-Carsonville) has introduced a pair of bills, HB 4027 and HB 4028, to repeal the changes to the permitting process. 
“Local governments and residents know their areas better than the state,” Alexander said in a press release. “They craft policies with this in mind, and people expect their elected local officials to make decisions for their communities and their families with their input at the forefront. When unelected state bureaucrats to come in, cast local input aside and impose projects onto communities, it’s a textbook example of government overreach. Our locals should be able to make decisions on property use for themselves, and these bills re-establish this critical element.”
Engaging with communities
Elise Matz, the vice president of public affairs for Circle Power, said that public acceptance of renewables was a challenge within the state, emphasizing the importance of engaging with the community on the benefits the project could bring. 
Matt Wagner, the manager of renewable energy development for DTE Energy, one of the state’s largest energy companies, said that the best advertisement for a company’s next clean energy project is the last project it finished. 
“If those projects go well, you know, we can point to them. It’s not just us pointing to them, it’s other communities and leaders saying, ‘Hey, you know, these guys did a great project over here. You can trust them.’ That’s our goal,” Wagner said. 
On another panel, John Freeman, executive director of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association, pointed to three main stumbling blocks in encouraging clean energy adoption: education, affordability and the disparity in access. 
“People are inherently nervous about big social change, and there’s nothing fundamentally bigger than transitioning from our current energy system to one that’s built around renewable energy. So we have to do a lot of education to make people feel comfortable with this change,” Freeman said, later pointing to the association’s efforts in teaching local governments how to develop a sustainability plan and bringing local officials up to speed on the benefits solar energy systems can bring to a community.

Ali Dirul, the chief executive officer of Ryter Cooperative Industries, which helps design and build solar energy systems, said oftentimes solar developments are done to communities, instead of with them. 
“A large solar farm is just plotted in the middle of somebody’s recreation area and then, you know, there’s upheaval, because it’s like anything, if somebody just slapped something in the back of your backyard, you’d ask some questions,” Dirul said. 
Community members are the ones who know what they need in their neighborhoods, Dirul noted, creating an opportunity for developers, funders, foundations and foundations to engage with them so that the community can actually benefit.
In the developers panel, the speakers highlighted Michigan’s renewable ready communities award, which provides communities who adopt renewable energy with $5,000 per megawatt of capacity to a maximum of $3 million as  a major motivator for communities. 
However, renewable energy may remain inaccessible to some families, Dirul said, using renters, people who live in multifamily homes, and those who do not have the money upfront for these kinds of projects as an example.

One way to address these concerns is through community solar, Freeman said, allowing residents to buy or subscribe to individual solar panels in an array in order to save money on their energy bills due to the energy generated by the panels. However, these arrangements do not currently have a legal framework in Michigan, with Freeman calling for lawmakers to enact a community solar law. 
Economic hurdles
On the other panel, Kunkle further emphasized the impact that federal tariffs would have on procuring materials for battery storage and other clean energy efforts. 
Wagner similarly addressed concerns with navigating the supply chain as President Donald Trump implements and pauses tariffs. 
“When you’re ordering, literally, in some cases, not just tens of millions, but hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, it’s kind of hard to be nimble and do that in a pause,” Wagner said.
“DTE was fortunate to get a lot of infrastructure in early and we warehoused it. We had no idea how smart we look now,” Wagner said, later noting that this was only a short term solution, with clean energy developers in need of more domestic supply. 
Kunkle also emphasized the importance of retaining clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, which face an uncertain future as Trump works to roll back climate efforts implemented under former President Joe Biden.
“If you do that, the price of energy goes up,” Kunkle said, explaining that companies who have committed to building out additional energy resources will still need to procure those resources even as prices increase. 
Both panels also discussed workforce development needs, and ways to cultivate clean energy jobs within Michigan communities and ensure that the energy workforce sees a just transition. 
Matz noted Circle Power’s strong relationship with the building trade workers in the Upper Peninsula, who she said served as major advocates for renewable energy efforts and helped change sentiments on a project from something that may or may not work, to something that is real and will be constructed safely. 
Wagner called for efforts to encourage renewable energy careers, noting that DTE partners with technical colleges across the state, noting that these jobs could help keep families together as young people look for opportunities out of Michigan. 
“[Parents] hated seeing their kids move away from Bad Axe or move away from other rural communities. It’s like, ‘How can you do something to help us bring them back?’ Well, There’s enough renewable energy development projects across Michigan that are going to be going in in the next 10 to 15 to 20 years. If some of these young people from these communities go and get trained, they can be back in their communities with a real, well-paying job. And when parents hear that, it just gives that hope they’re not going to lose their kids,” Wagner said.
Dirul noted that while there is no shortage of talent in Detroit to help build and operate clean energy systems, the one thing that is missing is access to training. 
“We want to ensure that everybody has access to these pipelines, to these educations, to these trainings, to these certifications, so that they can advance themselves, advance their careers and potentially become gainfully employed in the clean energy industry,” Dirul said. 
“We’re also looking to just expand beyond entry level jobs. Like, we should also look at management and entrepreneurship.… Not everybody’s going to get up on a roof and install solar, and for many people, that’s the one thing that will actually detract them from trying to get into the clean energy industry,” Dirul said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210422_183518265-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-24 14:14:44.238046

Mike Braun.","Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith closes the voting machine for legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana is set to join the handful of states running partisan school board elections after a squeaker of a final vote Thursday — pending a decision from Republican Gov. Mike Braun.
All 50 members of the Senate rushed to participate in the 26-24 concurrence tally, with one straggler bursting into the chamber just before Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith closed the voting machine. The GOP supermajority barely nabbed the constitutional minimum of 26 to avoid a tie-breaking vote from Beckwith, who presides over the Senate.
“My gosh, the wokeness they have in these school boards, even in Republican areas,” remarked Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis. “If you don’t believe this harms our kids, look at our scores.”
“We don’t know who the best people are with the best philosophy and why shouldn’t we know that?” he asked. He was among those supporters who believe school boards are too liberal.
Forty-one states provide for nonpartisan school board elections, according to Ballotpedia. Five allow for either, depending on the district, and four do partisan elections.
Senate Enrolled Act 287 would add Indiana to the latter group by requiring partisan designations on general election ballots.
Opponents argued the changes would introduce or exacerbate partisanship in schools.
“We heard the quiet part out loud: this bill is about fear of … diversity of thought, fear of challenging the status quo,” said Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington. “Why else would we turn school board elections into party primaries? To push out the independent thinker, to challenge or to silence the community member who doesn’t check the right partisan box but knows how to lead with expertise, experience and integrity.”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, asserted the legislation attempts to “fix a problem that doesn’t exist in my community.”

“My four school boards — I can tell you probably within 90% certainty what I think their political affiliations are — but it’s never an issue,” she said. “… Those school board members focus on the policy and how to get our K-12 kids to where they need to be to be successful.”
Author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, said it actually “gives the voters what they want.”
“If you’re getting your phones lit up from the school board association or maybe the superintendents — the voters want this,” he told his colleagues just before the vote.
The measure would require nominating petitions to state the candidate’s political party affiliation, that the candidate is independent of a party, or that the candidate choses to be listed as nonpartisan. Partisan hopefuls would have letters next to their names on general election ballots, while independent and nonpartisan candidates would get blank spaces. Straight-ticket voting — in which voters can choose a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single ballot mark — wouldn’t apply.
But that’s not how the proposal originally accomplished its goal. It would’ve required school board candidates to run in partisan primary elections until House lawmakers stripped that out and resurrected their own pared-back language.
The Senate seemed inclined to agree to the House’s overhaul when it filed a concurrence April 1, but that was withdrawn April 10. Senators then voted to dissent. A conference committee, tasked with drawing up a compromise, met Monday — but on Tuesday, the dissent was rescinded and replaced with another concurrence.

That motion sat on the Senate’s calendar for two days. Byrne skipped it multiple times as lawmakers key to the vote were absent.
Much of the opposition, particularly among Republicans, centered on federal employees.
Sen. Eric Bassler feared the legislation would disqualify many of his constituents — his district hosts a U.S. Navy base — from running in partisan school board elections by implicating the federal Hatch Act.
“These are the exact people that this body should want to run for school board,” Bassler, R-Washington, said. “These are engineers. These are scientists. These are experts in finance.”
  Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, defends his legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But the Hatch Act is “already in play today,” Byrne said.
He cited a January U.S. Office of Special Counsel opinion, which finds that an election labeled “nonpartisan” becomes partisan if a single candidate is endorsed by or “acts in concert” with a party.
When Brown asked him how, however, he replied, “I cannot tell you that.”
He said the legislation may bring “attention” to the Hatch Act so that “maybe it will come into play now more often.”
Indiana judicial staff could also be blocked from school board service under state rules.
The proposal retains another partisan feature.
A candidate claiming affiliation with a political party would have to meet Indiana’s two-party rule: the candidate’s most recent two primary votes must match the party sought to represent. If not, a county party chair’s O.K. is required. That could block thousands of Hoosiers from running under specific party designations.
A provision allowing for higher school board member pay remains. It nixes the current $2,000 maximum and instead ties compensation to 10% of starting teacher salaries. The state-mandated $40,000 salary floor would double school board pay to $4,000.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge rejected a former Kansas foster care leader’s request to leave the country, even though a Chicago faith leader vouched for him.
Robert “Father Bobby” Smith, who led Saint Francis Ministries from 2014 to 2020, faces federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering. He asked the court last month to travel from his home in Johnson City, Tennessee, to El Salvador so he could visit his ex-wife and attend their daughter’s high school graduation.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse sided with a prosecutor who warned that Smith was a flight risk, based on family connections and the federal government’s inability to apprehend him if he stayed in El Salvador.
Pastor Corey Brooks, of New Beginnings Church of Chicago, wrote a letter dated April 10 to the judge in support of Smith’s request to travel.
“I have every confidence that his intent is to attend the graduation, celebrate his daughter’s success, and return to Tennessee,” Brooks wrote.
Brooks said he believes so much in Smith that he was willing to travel with him to the graduation.
But court records show Crouse denied Smith’s request at an April 16 hearing.
The judge also set a status conference for April 30. Past court filings showed Smith and co-defendant William Whymark, the former IT director for Saint Francis, are negotiating a plea deal.
The two are accused of defrauding Saint Francis, the largest foster care contractor in Kansas, of at least $4.7 million.
Saint Francis hired Smith, who had been ordained as an Episcopal priest by the Diocese of Chicago, as president and CEO in 2014. Kansas Reflector first reported on allegations of misconduct by Smith and Whymark shortly after they left Saint Francis in November 2020.

(Image courtesy of Pace-O-Matic) A Hanover County judge handed down a ruling Wednesday that could reshape the future of skill games in Virginia, siding with a convenience store owner who faced criminal charges for operating several Queen of Virginia (QVS2) skill machines.
Judge Hugh Campbell of the Hanover County General District Court dismissed the case against David Bogese, owner of the Breez-In Mart, after finding that the QVS2 devices at his store did not meet the legal definition of illegal gambling machines under state law. 
The ruling marks a significant victory for small business owners across the commonwealth who have fought to keep the machines in their stores amid legal ambiguity and political pressure from the casino industry.
“It feels good to get this decisive ruling today defending the right for small businesses to operate within the law,” Bogese said after Wednesday’s hearing. “Today is a victory not just for our case and our business, but for small businesses across the commonwealth to take part in our free market and against the overreaches of government. I am looking forward to getting back to business as usual.”
 The case and legal arguments

Bogese had been charged with a misdemeanor under Virginia Code §18.2-331, which prohibits possession of an “illegal gambling device.” 
The charge stemmed from the presence of four QVS2 skill games, developed by Georgia-based software firm Pace-O-Matic, at his store in Hanover County. Prosecutors argued that the machines violated the state’s gambling statute, which bans devices that require players to insert a coin, bill, ticket, token, or similar object to activate gameplay. 
But the defense countered that the QVS2 terminals in Bogese’s store did not require the insertion of any such object and were, therefore, fully compliant with Virginia law.
Attorneys Ryan McDougle and Bill Stanley — both of whom are also Republican members of the Virginia Senate — represented Bogese. They moved to dismiss the charge through a motion to strike the commonwealth’s evidence, asserting that prosecutors had failed to prove the QVS2 machines met the statutory definition of an illegal gambling device.
Judge Campbell ruled in favor of the defense, applying the “rule of lenity” — a legal doctrine requiring that ambiguities in criminal law be interpreted in the defendant’s favor. He found that because the QVS2 machine lacked any requirement for players to insert currency or objects into the machine, it did not qualify as a prohibited device under the law.
The judge also found that the statute itself was too vague, creating uncertainty for business owners trying to follow the law. His ruling echoed concerns raised repeatedly in recent years by small business advocates and gaming law experts.
A spokesman for Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office was investigating the legality of QVS2 machines,  did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. 
 What are QVS2 games?

The QVS2 terminals represent a redesigned version of the Queen of Virginia Skill games that had become popular in bars, restaurants and convenience stores across the state. 
Unlike earlier models, which included slots-style mechanics and coin operation, the QVS2 machines are entirely cashless. Players must check in with a store attendant before starting a game, and no coin, cash, or other tangible object is inserted into the device.
The games were launched in Virginia in August 2024 by Pace-O-Matic, which said it developed the new model specifically to comply with Virginia law. The company also voluntarily raised the minimum age to play the games from 18 to 21 in anticipation of possible legislative changes.
Prior to rollout, the company consulted with several prominent legal experts, including former Virginia Attorneys General Jerry Kilgore and Tony Troy, who — along with regulatory attorneys Jason Hicks and Stephen Piepgrass — issued a joint legal opinion stating that the games were legal under current statutes.
At the time, the QVS2 devices were still in a beta-testing phase across Virginia, with limited deployment intended to assess their performance and regulatory fit. It is unknown how many of the machines are currently operating statewide. 
“Pace-O-Matic has consistently maintained that our QVS2 skill game is fully compliant with the plain language of the law in Virginia. We have never and will never operate outside the confines of the law, and this ruling affirms that,” Pace-O-Matic spokeswoman Rachel Albritton said in a statement Thursday. 
“While this is a significant legal victory for Pace-O-Matic, the real winners are the hundreds of small businesses across the commonwealth, many of which are family-owned mom-and-pop shops, that depend on income from skill games to survive. Furthermore, this legal win underscores Pace-O-Matic’s dedication to fostering a responsible gaming environment while providing legal gaming options that support small businesses.”
 Political and legal context

Skill games had existed in Virginia for decades in a largely unregulated space, but that changed in 2020 when the General Assembly passed legislation banning the devices. The move came amid concerns from some lawmakers and casino developers that the widespread use of skill games could undercut the profitability of newly approved casino projects.
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state granted a temporary reprieve, allowing skill games to remain in operation for one year to help small businesses survive the economic downturn. That reprieve expired in 2021. The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, which had been tasked with temporary oversight, ended enforcement efforts the same year, leaving skill game operators in legal limbo.
In the absence of clear regulations, businesses continued to operate the games until late 2023, when the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the state’s ban, reversing a lower court decision that had paused enforcement. That ruling once again cast uncertainty over whether businesses using newer skill games — like the QVS2 — were in violation of the law.
Earlier this year, during the 2025 legislative session, Virginia lawmakers weighed a series of proposals aimed at bringing regulation and structure to the skill game industry. 
Among them was Senate Bill 1322, introduced by Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, which proposed a $1,200 monthly tax per gaming device. The bill would have directed 70% of the resulting revenue to a new Elementary and Secondary Education Fund, with the remainder split among local governments, infrastructure projects and programs addressing gambling addiction. The legislation was ultimately referred to the budget process for further discussion.
DeSteph defended the measure by pointing to a previous effort under former Gov. Ralph Northam that generated $138 million in revenue from 11,000 machines. “This is the same model, to keep it simple,” DeSteph said at the time, noting added safeguards such as ABC-issued tracking stickers and geolocation key cards to enhance accountability.
Despite support from some lawmakers who saw the legislation as a way to raise revenue while introducing regulatory oversight, similar efforts faced resistance from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who vetoed related legislation last year.
In a separate effort, Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, introduced SB 1287 to create an independent Virginia Gaming Commission that would oversee all forms of legal gambling in the state, excluding the lottery. 
The bill envisioned consolidating regulatory authority over casinos, sports betting and charitable gaming into a single agency, absorbing staff from existing state departments to improve oversight and reduce redundancy.
Supporters framed the proposal as a step toward modernizing and unifying Virginia’s gaming regulation.
“While I’m not a particular fan of gaming, I also face the reality that Virginia is becoming a gaming state,” said McDougle, addressing the Senate committee reviewing the measure. “We ought to have a little bit of a focus on how we’re doing that and make sure that we’re making good decisions.”
Ultimately, neither proposal made it into the revised budget lawmakers sent to Youngkin in February. While the governor has expressed support for establishing a gaming commission, he remains opposed to legalizing electronic skill games and has yet to endorse any plan that would bring them fully into a regulated market.
How Wednesday’s ruling in Hanover — which marked the first time a Virginia court has addressed the legality of the new QVS2 models in a criminal context — will impact future legislative efforts, remains to be seen.
The Virginia Merchants and Amusement Coalition (VA MAC), which represents store owners and game operators, issued a statement calling the ruling “a clear victory for small businesses.”
“Many of our members are operating legal QVS2 skill games as a means of supplemental income to keep their doors open,” said VA MAC President Rich Kelly. “Skill games give local small businesses, many of which are family-owned, additional income to pay wages, make improvements, and in some cases, keep the lights on.”
He added, “While we are thrilled with the outcome of this case, we continue to look forward to working with legislators on a solution to regulate and tax skill games in the future.”
Stanley, one of the two state attorneys representing Bogese, echoed that sentiment, framing the ruling as a blow to what he characterized as “casino-driven” efforts to squeeze small businesses out of Virginia’s emerging gaming industry. He said that the ruling should instill confidence in all small business owners who operate or want to operate skill games legally. 
“We’ve shown that the law, as written, does not prohibit these machines. Now it’s time for lawmakers to bring clarity through responsible regulation.”

(Photo courtesy of Santee Development Company)COLUMBIA — Orangeburg County residents asked legislators to greenlight a proposal to legalize a casino they argue would invigorate their area’s struggling economy.
Their pleas this week came in the first — and likely last — hearing in the House this year for three pro-gambling bills. The Ways and Means subcommittee took no vote, and the 2025 session ends in two weeks.
But the hearing alone signified a new willingness by Republicans to allow wide-open gambling in a Statehouse that has historically avoided even small changes to the state’s anti-gambling laws.
The bills considered Tuesday would legalize online sports gambling, categorize certain games of skill as not gambling and allow a casino off Interstate 95 bordering the town of Santee. The latter got the most attention at the two-hour hearing.
That bill starts by declaring that “casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina,” but it is for the poor, rural area along I-95 that would benefit from the jobs and money a casino would bring.
Plans are already drawn up for a casino and resort near the southern shores of Lake Marion, with the expectation of bringing in tourists off two interstates to a rural area known for its golfing and fishing. (The property is just off I-95, a major East Coast artery, and only 10 miles from the intersection with Interstate 26.)
“This is an opportunity, a transformational opportunity, an economic opportunity, and it’s one that I believe that we cannot at this point ignore,” Rep. Jerry Govan, D-Orangeburg, told his colleagues.
The project brings an odd mix of players: It’s spearheaded by a GOP megadonor and sponsored by legislators of both parties, while opposed mostly by Republican legislators and groups that generally advocate for GOP initiatives.
While he didn’t attend the meeting, the real estate developer behind the plan, Wallace Cheves of Greenville, pledged not to seek any incentives, publicly funded infrastructure, or subsidies toward building a “world-class, billion-dollar destination resort and casino.”
“We strongly believe that this investment should be driven by private enterprise, not taxpayer dollars, ensuring no financial risk to the public sector,” Cheves said in an emailed statement. “That’s why we are fully committed to not seeking a single dime of local or state funding.”
The legislation’s wording allows a casino in any economically distressed county with I-95 running through it, if the county council approves. But Cheves stressed the legislation supports his “single-casino initiative.”
SC bill would legalize gambling on horse races. Don’t bet on it.

Gambling opponents
Those speaking against the proposal Tuesday included representatives of the South Carolina Baptist Convention and Palmetto Family Council — two groups that have fought pro-gambling bills in South Carolina for decades.
“It’s a moment of moral reckoning. The spread of gambling forces us to ask some tough questions,” Steve Pettit, president of the faith-based lobbying council, told legislators.
“These are systems that feed on desperation. They promise hope, but they deliver harm. They are built to profit from loss and to disguise addiction as opportunity,” he continued.
Other groups joining a letter of opposition sent to legislators ahead of the meeting included the Catholic Diocese of Charleston, which covers all of South Carolina; and Faith Wins America, founded by former state GOP Chairman Chad Connelly.
The Catawba’s decades of failed attempts
Also arguing against the bill was the chief of the Catawba Nation, which received its status as South Carolina’s only federally recognized tribe through a 1993 settlement. It allowed the Catawba to operate bingo games but otherwise put the tribe under the state’s anti-gambling laws.
And the Legislature has repeatedly refused to allow the tribe to operate anything approaching a casino.
That included efforts to build a high-stakes bingo parlor off I-95. The Catawba even went to court for permission to operate video poker machines on their reservation as a bargaining chip for the bingo parlor.
It didn’t work. Republicans didn’t budge, and the state Supreme Court ruled against the Catawba in 2007. They tried again and lost in 2014.
Now, Republicans are looking to authorize a casino in the same location where former GOP lawmakers refused to allow bingo — and give the authority to the developer who bought the property after splitting from the Catawba.
Cheves helped the Catawba buy land and develop a casino in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, before their relationship soured, and the National Indian Gaming Commission ruled in 2022 that their agreement violated federal law because Cheves’ company had too much power.
While the Catawba opened the Kings Mountain casino in 2021, the tribe still wants to operate in South Carolina.
“That’s helping our people, but it’s still not enough,” Catawba Chief Brian Harris said about the casino roughly 50 miles northwest of the York County reservation.
“We can do the same here, not only benefitting the Catawba people, but South Carolina as a whole,” he told legislators. “We could come together and correct the crooked past of our state regulations.
“They could have let the Catawba Nation do it 30 years ago, let them do it on that land 10 years ago,” he said of the Santee property now owned by Cheves.
A solution to poverty?
Harris noted that 18% of Catawba on the reservation in York County live in poverty.
The numbers are worse in Orangeburg County, where 22% of residents live in poverty, and the median household income is $43,200, according to census estimates for 2023.
Cheves, owner of the Santee Development Company, said he intends to “revitalize and transform an economically challenged region of our state” with “thousands of good-paying jobs, driving tourism, and expanding business opportunities for local communities.”
Construction costs alone are expected to top $600 million, not including design and site work expenses, according to an economic analysis provided to the Gazette from The Innovation Group, a gaming and hospitality consulting firm.
Bishop Hayes Gainey with Faith Group 4 Action, which advocates for living improvements in the city and county of Orangeburg, said a casino in Santee would “eradicate a whole lot of poverty” in the county.
“That will create a power base in our economy, that will create opportunities for many citizens in Orangeburg County and the surrounding areas,” he said. “But most importantly, it will give hope where there’s a lot of people in despair.”
Scott Peavy, who operates Team Polebender Fishing Adventures in Santee, said he loves the area, but the economy is stale.
“There’s been no change whatsoever in Santee and Orangeburg County for years,” he said. “The economic impact that this casino would make for that area would be phenomenal.”
Douglas Walker, a College of Charleston economics professor who consults for the gambling industry, estimated that the state could collect $70 million to $100 million annually in tax revenue from the casino.
“Fundamentally, I think it comes down to a question about, do you want people to be able to do what they want to do?” said Walker, whose firm is called Casinonomics Consulting. “It’s a matter of choice, and a lot of people just enjoy the activity of gambling.”
While the casino bill and others legalizing gambling likely won’t get any traction before the session ends May 8, they stay alive for consideration next year — an election year for every House member and statewide office.
But the odds aren’t good for next year either.
Even if the legislation manages to make it through both chambers, gambling bills face a likely veto from Gov. Henry McMaster, who’s made it clear his longtime opposition to gambling hasn’t changed.
“Gambling is bad for our culture,” McMaster told reporters earlier this month. “It’s not part of our heritage and there are better ways to make money, to give jobs, to generate tax money, to generate a thriving economy.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SanteeRendering-1-e1745512490653-1024x565.jpg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

Ruth Canovi, the association’s director of advocacy in Connecticut, said year after year, Fairfield County used to have the worst ozone pollution east of the Mississippi.
“This year, actually, there was one metro area that has worse worsening ozone than we do,” she said. “But that’s not because we’ve improved. That’s because they worsened.”
Cook County, Illinois, is now at the top of this unfortunate list.
“Fairfield County has certainly the worst ozone pollution, or smog pollution, in all of New England,” Canovi said.
Ozone smog and daily particle pollution worsened in the New Haven, Hartford and the Waterbury metro area, according to the report. Unhealthy days for short-term particle pollution more than tripled in Litchfield County.
“Both ozone pollution and particulate matter pollution … they’re two of the most widespread and dangerous air pollutants,” Canovi said. “They can cause asthma attacks, respiratory and cardiovascular harm, including heart attack and stroke and even early death.”
Even relatively low levels of ozone can cause health effects, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Fairfield County accounts for about 25% of Connecticut’s population. Compared to the rest of Connecticut, according to the report, the county had the most pediatric asthma cases (15,463); adult asthma (81,758); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (35,190); lung cancer (537); and cardiovascular diseases (56,117).
‘The air quality has gotten worse’
Across Connecticut, people working in outdoor jobs, like construction and landscaping, and unhoused populations and those living close to highways and industrial sites continue to be disproportionately impacted, said Dr. David Hill, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Waterbury Hospital.
“The air quality has gotten worse and more patients are coming in with increased trouble breathing on hot and humid days, when the air quality is worse,” he said.
Hill recalled higher patient volumes and new onset asthma during the Canadian wildfires in 2023, and is concerned by the current wildfires in New Jersey.
More than 125 million people live in U.S. counties with “F” grades for ozone smog. And 93 additional counties earned an “F” in this year’s report (2021-2023 data), according to the American Lung Association, which has published its annual air quality data since 2000.
This annual “report card” tracks exposure nationwide to unhealthy levels of ozone and particle pollution. The latest data showed that 77 million people in the U.S. — more than one-fifth of the nation’s total population — live in counties with “F” grades for particle pollution.
Climate change to blame 
Canovi said climate change takes much of the blame.
“The Clean Air Act was passed in the 1970s, and the air has gotten better,” she said. “However, we know that climate change is making it harder for us to clean up the air, so we really need to do all that we can to reduce emissions from fossil fuel sources.”
Canovi urged people to pay attention to air quality. “We want them to take precautions when they know their health is at risk,” she said.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.
The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and lawmakers in Montana and North Dakota have sent proposals to their governors. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, and an Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

Read this story in English.
El Gobernador Ned Lamont promueve un plan que ofrecería educación preescolar gratuita o a precio reducido a numerosas familias de Connecticut. Este plan es uno de varios proyectos de ley que los legisladores están considerando para mejorar el acceso a la educación infantil temprana.
El tema cuenta con un amplio apoyo de legisladores, padres, defensores y miembros de la comunidad empresarial. Esto se debe en parte a que la pandemia de COVID-19 puso de relieve la urgente necesidad de cuidado infantil para muchos, incluido Lamont, y fue el catalizador para que creara un Panel de Apoyo para estudiar el tema. Sin embargo, financiar el acceso de más familias a guarderías y mejorar los salarios de los trabajadores del sector es una propuesta costosa.
Esto es lo que debe saber.
¿Calificaría mi familia para el plan de preescolar del gobernador?
Depende de los ingresos de su hogar. Las familias que ganan hasta $100,000 al año no pagarían nada por preescolar. Las familias que ganan hasta $150,000 al año pagarían solo $20 al día. Sin embargo, los hogares que ganan más de $150,000 al año seguirían pagando de su bolsillo el preescolar, a menos que tengan acceso a escuelas en un distrito que ofrezca plazas, como New Haven y Hartford.
¿Qué medidas tomaría el plan del gobernador para el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños?
Actualmente, el plan del gobernador no cubre el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños, solo para niños de 3 a 5 años. Si bien los defensores afirman que el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños es fundamental para las familias de Connecticut, especialmente para ayudar a las empresas a cubrir más de 90,000 vacantes en todo el estado, muchos aún apoyan el plan de Lamont porque, según ellos, representa un gran paso en la dirección correcta.
Además, según los defensores, el plan de Lamont mantendría la integridad del sistema de cuidado infantil que existe actualmente al mejorar los salarios de los trabajadores de las guarderías, a la vez que aumenta la capacidad y las plazas en las escuelas públicas.
¿Cómo inscribiría a mis hijos en el plan de preescolar de Lamont?
Los legisladores prevén un nuevo portal que proporcionaría información de fácil acceso para que los padres puedan consultar rápidamente todas las opciones de preescolar disponibles. Actualmente se están considerando proyectos de ley que proponen esta solución, incluyendo el Proyecto de Ley de la Cámara de Representantes 5003, un plan más integral para apoyar la atención a la primera infancia, y el Proyecto de Ley de la Cámara de Representantes 7044, que se centra en la creación del portal en línea.
¿Cuándo estarán disponibles estas plazas adicionales de preescolar?
La Comisionada de la Oficina de la Primera Infancia, Beth Bye, afirma que se añadiría un número significativo de nuevas plazas de preescolar subvencionadas para 2028 y que, para 2032, la gran mayoría de la población de preescolar de Connecticut tendría acceso. Estas plazas se distribuirían entre centros de cuidado infantil, escuelas públicas, hogares de cuidado infantil grupal y hogares de cuidado infantil familiar.
¿Cómo financiaría Connecticut todas estas nuevas plazas?
Según el plan de Lamont, hasta 300 millones de dólares de fondos excedentes se destinarían a un Fondo Universal de Dotación Preescolar. De esa cantidad, 30 millones de dólares podrían gastarse en el próximo año fiscal, y el 10% de la dotación sería elegible para gastarse cada año a partir de entonces. En su discurso sobre el presupuesto, Lamont declaró con optimismo a los legisladores: “Nuestro presupuesto anticipa casi mil millones de dólares en la dotación durante los próximos años, si Dios, la economía y el presidente Trump lo permiten”.
¿Qué otros planes hay sobre la mesa?
Los legisladores también están considerando otros planes para la educación preescolar. El Proyecto de Ley 1 del Senado implicaría un enfoque de cuatro fases que eventualmente cubriría no solo la educación preescolar, sino también el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños. Al igual que la propuesta de Lamont, se basaría en fondos excedentes. La primera fase de esta propuesta exigiría un modelo de “triple participación” en el que se pediría a las empresas que contribuyeran al costo del cuidado infantil para sus empleados, pero la participación sería voluntaria. Otro plan, el Proyecto de Ley 5003 de la Cámara de Representantes, busca permitir que más hogares califiquen para Care4Kids, ampliaría el fondo de subsidio para el cuidado infantil, brindaría apoyo a los trabajadores de cuidado infantil y ayudaría con las renovaciones de las instalaciones de cuidado infantil. Por último, el Proyecto de Ley 1369 del Senado proporcionaría asistencia financiera a las familias trabajadoras para pagar el cuidado infantil, mediante un nuevo impuesto sobre la nómina del 1.5% para las grandes empresas con fines de lucro.
¿Por qué este tema se ha convertido en una prioridad?
Durante la pandemia de COVID, el acceso a servicios de cuidado infantil asequibles y de calidad cobró protagonismo. De repente, los trabajadores médicos y otros trabajadores esenciales de Connecticut se quedaron sin cuidado infantil. La defensora Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman afirmó que el COVID “creó una realidad distópica” en la que los trabajadores renunciaban a diestra y siniestra porque simplemente no había cuidado infantil disponible y la necesidad de cuidado infantil para la supervivencia de la fuerza laboral se hizo repentinamente evidente.
En 2023, Lamont creó un Panel de Expertos para estudiar el cuidado infantil. El proyecto de ley que los legisladores están considerando es resultado del informe del panel, que concluyó que el sector enfrentaba muchos problemas simultáneamente, desde los bajos salarios de los cuidadores infantiles y los maestros de preescolar, hasta la falta de transporte en algunas regiones rurales y el horario limitado en los programas de las escuelas públicas, lo que imposibilitaba a los padres trabajar y recoger y dejar a sus hijos. El plan del gobernador pretende abordar todos estos problemas.
Con tantos recortes federales, ¿habrá realmente suficiente dinero en el presupuesto estatal?
Esa pregunta aún no tiene respuesta. Con los significativos recortes federales a todo tipo de programas, desde bibliotecas y museos hasta servicios de apoyo para personas sin hogar, y las amenazas a Medicaid y Medicare, es lógico que los superávits previstos cuando se redactó el plan no estén disponibles.
Cabe destacar que Lamont ha mantenido el plan a pesar de toda la conmoción de los últimos meses. Al ser preguntado en el evento “In the Room” del Connecticut Mirror, que incluyó una entrevista personal con el gobernador el 26 de marzo, sobre qué problema solucionaría en el estado si pudiera solucionar algo, Lamont mencionó la educación, en concreto la primera infancia. Al igual que la reducción del déficit de las pensiones, Lamont planteó el tema como una parte clave del legado que podría dejar.
“Creo que si haces eso, al final has dejado huella y marcado la diferencia”, dijo.

Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, known as IRIS, operates a 5,000-square-foot warehouse and food pantry on Hamilton Street. The site feeds more than 650 families.
However, earlier this year, the Trump administration cut $4 million, which the federal government used to contribute to their annual budget of $15 million.

Now, the privately funded, community-service run Community Soup Kitchen will pay IRIS’s $4,000-a-month rent, and the two companies will share the space.
Gregory DePetris, CSK’s board chair, said the partnership would be mutually beneficial.
“Food insecurity in our city is rising. Public funding to support emergency food providers is increasingly unpredictable. And that’s exactly why the partnership with IRIS matters so deeply,” DePetris said. “It’s a practical and powerful response to a growing need.”
“Because federal funding is cut, it does not stop our care for the people that we serve, and this partnership is a demonstration of that commitment,” IRIS Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem said. “When we have to reduce operating costs, we look around for partnerships that allow us to continue serving.”

State and local officials, including Mayor Justin Elicker (D) and Governor Ned Lamont (D) visited the site on Wednesday, as community members picked up their food.
“I just think that Community Soup Kitchen and IRIS are exactly what makes America great,” Lamont said. “And sometimes Washington forgets that, as they are right now.”
Lamont listened as IRIS food pantry manager Johanna Snyder went down the list of how much surrounding states contribute to combating food insecurity: $30 million in Massachusetts, $35 million in New York and $85 million in New Jersey.
Connecticut spent $850,000 last year.
Snyder wants state lawmakers to pass H.B. 7021, which would allocate $10 million to DSS for Connecticut Foodshare. The organization buys and distributes food to the state’s pantries.
“We’re going to do what we can within the context of an honestly balanced budget,” Lamont told reporters after the event.

,DC,2025-04-24 16:15:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Tax policy, Medicaid funding cuts could scuttle Republicans' ‘big, beautiful bill’","Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tax-policy-medicaid-funding-cuts-could-scuttle-republicans-big-beautiful-bill,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans in Congress have a difficult few months ahead of them as they look to broker agreement within their exceptionally narrow majority on policy issues that have already begun to divide centrists from far-right members of the party.The negotiations will be the first test of the sort for Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who weren’t in the top posts eight years ago when the GOP passed its last reconciliation package.Tax law and funding cuts to Medicaid are the issues most likely to prevent one “big, beautiful bill” from moving through both chambers and reaching President Donald Trump’s desk.Republican leaders will also need to be cautious as the package takes shape about what types of proposals their more vulnerable members vote on, especially if they hope to hold onto at least one chamber of Congress following next year’s midterm elections.“The swing-district Republicans are in a tougher spot because their voters do want to see some of those tax cuts extended, but they don't want to see it at the expense of programs like Medicaid,” said Dr. Ben Sommers, Huntley Quelch professor of health care economics at Harvard.“And so they're walking a tightrope,” he said. “And at least until there's a final bill on the floor, a lot of them are going to just keep pushing that final decision down the road and hope that something else happens and that they don't have to make that tough call.”The decision to bundle together a permanent extension of the 2017 tax law, hundreds of billions in new spending on border security and defense, a rewrite of the nation's energy policy and spending cuts means that centrist Republicans will have to cast one take-it-or-leave-it vote.Breaking up the sweeping package into two or more bills would have given at-risk Republicans the opportunity for more tailored votes, but GOP leaders ultimately rejected that idea — a choice that will put moderates under increasing pressure as the legislation takes shape in the coming weeks.Democrats in both chambers are expected to unanimously oppose the package.Normally that would present a challenge in the Senate, where 60 votes are usually needed to limit debate on a bill and move onto final passage. But GOP leaders are using the reconciliation process to pass their bill, meaning they only need the support of a simple majority in the Senate. Slim marginsHouse committee chairs are expected to release and mark up 11 bills after the chamber returns from a two-week break in late April, though that’s only the first step.Once the pieces are all bundled into one package, it will need to get across the House floor without losing more than three Republican votes, a much narrower threshold than the dozen GOP lawmakers in that chamber who voted against the final version of the 2017 tax law.Republican leaders will then need to keep the party from making significant changes to the package in the Senate, where lawmakers will be able to offer as many amendments as they want when the bill comes to the floor.That vote-a-rama will test party unity, with Democrats likely to propose amendments re-writing or eliminating specific sections of the bill — especially those addressing tax provisions benefiting the wealthy or corporations, and Medicaid spending cuts.If more than three Senate Republicans break from the party to alter various elements, it could endanger final approval. However, if GOP senators from swing states vote to keep unpopular provisions in the bill, it could lead to them losing their next reelection bid to a Democrat.Difference of opinion on MedicaidThe disagreement between centrist Republicans and far-right lawmakers over potential spending cuts to Medicaid is already on full display.During floor debate on the budget resolution that cleared the way for Republicans to write the massive reconciliation package, Texas Rep. Chip Roy excoriated the state-federal health program for lower income Americans and some people with disabilities.“Medicaid is debilitating the vulnerable, not helping them,” Roy said. “We are shoveling money out to the able-bodied on the back of expansion of Obamacare.”On the other ideological side of the conference, a group of 14 centrist House Republicans sent a letter to GOP leaders a few days after voting to adopt the budget resolution to announce they “cannot and will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.”“Cuts to Medicaid also threaten the viability of hospitals, nursing homes, and safety-net providers nationwide,” they wrote. “Many hospitals — particularly in rural and underserved areas — rely heavily on Medicaid funding, with some receiving over half their revenue from the program alone.“Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage.”Failed Obamacare repealRepublican leaders in Congress will want to avoid a repeat of the last time the party tried to overhaul health care in a reconciliation package.During Trump’s first term, following years of GOP politicians pledging to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, they sought to do just that through the same complex reconciliation process they’re using now.Ultimately, twenty Republicans voted against the bill in the House and three GOP senators — Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Arizona’s John McCain and Maine’s Susan Collins — blocked that chamber’s repeal-and-replace bill.Collins said in a floor speech at the time she voted against the House’s version of the bill for several reasons, including that it would have made “sweeping changes to the Medicaid program — an important safety net that for more than 50 years has helped poor and disabled individuals, including children and low-income seniors, receive health care.”Murkowski wrote in a statement that she voted against the Senate’s so-called “skinny” repeal bill because “both sides must do better on process and substance.”“I know that access to affordable care is a challenge for so many. I hear from fishermen who can’t afford the coverage that they have, small business owners who can’t afford insurance at all, and those who have gained coverage for the first time in their life,” Murkowski wrote. “These Alaskans have shared their anxiety that their personal situation may be made worse under the legislation considered this week.”Medicaid cuts could hurt state budgetsGOP lawmakers in Congress won’t be the only members of the party that leaders need to keep in the fold. Republican governors may not have a vote in either chamber, but they do have considerable sway with their congressional delegations and many red states have a substantial percentage of their Medicaid programs covered by federal dollars.Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo released a letter last month seeking to assuage fears about potential federal cuts to Medicaid, writing that he was “actively engaged in conversations with the White House and others in the federal government to relay our state’s concerns.”“An abrupt reduction in federal funding would not only disrupt care for those who rely on Medicaid, but would also destabilize public and private healthcare providers, leading to workforce reductions, service limitations, and financial strain on already overburdened health care facilities,” Lombardo wrote.National Governors Association Chair Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Vice Chair Kevin Stitt, an Oklahoma Republican, wrote in a joint statement released in March that the organization is “committed to advocating for a robust and efficient health and human services system, including Medicaid.”“Without consultation and proper planning, Congressionally proposed reductions to Medicaid would impact state budgets, rural hospitals and health care service providers,” they wrote. “It is necessary for Governors to have a seat at the table when discussing any reforms and cuts to Medicaid funding.”Federal spending cuts to Medicaid could lead some of the 40 states that have expanded the program under Obamacare to roll it back, though Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have the expansion in their constitutions, making the impact of congressional action more complicated for their budgets and residents.Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and management at The George Washington University, said during an interview that even though GOP governors aren’t members of Congress, they still hold “powerful influence.”“We're talking about deep cuts in federal spending that will have profound effects on state economies and state employment,” Ku said. “Governors, particularly those who expanded Medicaid, should feel fairly nervous about: What are the implications for their states in terms of both their political futures as well as what it will do to their state economies?”“Again, we're talking about the possibility of maybe somewhere on the order of a million jobs being lost simply because of the Medicaid cuts,” he added. “And that should cause some trepidation among governors.”Republicans in Congress, Ku said, are trying to reduce spending. But when it comes to Medicaid, where the cost of administering the program is split between states and the federal government, any change to the federal share will come at the expense of the states.“So the states end up being losers,” he said. “And this will cause states’ governors some unease. Again, it depends on where they lie politically: They may still be willing to accept cuts if it fits in with their ideologies.”State and local taxesRepublicans also find themselves in a sticky situation when it comes to a major tax provision set to expire at the end of 2025: a limit on the amount of state and local taxes a taxpayer can deduct on their federal tax return. The limit is often simply referred to as the SALT cap.Like proposed Medicaid cuts, the SALT debate has potential to change the calculus of Republicans willing to vote for the one large reconciliation bill.For many years prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, taxpayers were able to take full advantage of deducting state and local taxes from their federal taxable income. But in that law, GOP lawmakers changed course and enacted a $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction to raise revenue to cover some of the law’s massive tax breaks.The ability to deduct all eligible state and local taxes on federal tax returns was a win for wealthy households located in states and municipalities with steeper taxes.At the time, Democrats, who wholesale opposed Trump’s tax agenda, saw the SALT cap as an attack on high-earning, high-tax blue states. But the SALT cap drew ire from across the aisle as well, said Kyle Pomerleau, senior fellow and federal tax policy expert for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.“The original bill also had a few Republicans that didn't vote for it because of the cap. So this has been controversial to some degree from the very beginning,” Pomerleau said.With such a narrow majority in the House, Republicans from high-tax areas, including those representing New York’s Long Island and Staten Island and California’s wealthy suburbs, will have leverage in the coming debate.“Republicans generally don't come from those states. There's only a handful of them. But that brings us back to the vote margin that Republicans have,” Pomerleau said. “They have a lot of power this time around to really get what they want. These lawmakers who represent people that are concerned about this cap are going to want that cap raised.”The issue is one of the few tax topics not polarized by party because it is defined by location, said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally supports lower taxes.“It's an interesting sort of debate, just because a lot of tax policy debates have political, partisan, ideological components, right? That’s somewhat predictable,” Watson said. “What's interesting about SALT is actually it’s also a strong geographic story.”Watson published the Tax Foundation’s 2023 county-by-county maps of state and local taxes paid as well as deducted from federal taxes in 2020. The data showed the top reporting counties were concentrated in California and New York.Raising cap would cost federal governmentBut many Republicans would be happy if the cap on SALT deductions stayed in place to offset the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts.Raising the cap beyond the current $10,000 limit could reduce federal revenue between $200 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next decade, depending on what level Congress decides, according to a January analysis from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that leans center-left.In other words, households deducting more from their federal taxable income means the federal government reaping less revenue.“Just to give you some order of magnitude, we looked at what would happen if you raised the cap from $10,000 to $20,000. That would cost (the federal government) $250 billion over 10 years. That's a big number,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Deficit hawks, like Roy of Texas and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, have spoken out in recent months against raising the cap.And while more federal revenue is lost with each dollar the cap increases, the benefit mainly goes to high-income earners, according to another Tax Policy Center analysis.“We estimated when you raise the (SALT cap) from $10,000 to $20,000, 93% of the benefit goes to the top …20% , which are people making more than $200,000,” Gleckman said. “And half of it goes to people in the top 5% who are people who make more than $400,000.”Most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which in 2025 sits at $15,000 for single taxpayers or $30,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.“That's why the vast majority of people get no benefit from this. It's only people who make a lot of money, who itemize, and who pay a lot of tax who get caught up in the cap,” Gleckman said.But they may have an outsized voice as Congress hammers out its reconciliation bill in the coming months.Johnson, a Louisiana Republican whose constituents would not benefit from raising the SALT cap, will have a “tough balancing act,” Gleckman said.“Mike Johnson looks at the narrow majority he has in the House, and he sees if he loses half a dozen seats from places like New York and California because he doesn't fix the cap then he could not be speaker anymore,” he said.Republicans in the bipartisan SALT caucus include Reps. Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota, Andrew Garbarino and Nicole Malliotakis, all representing New York, as well as Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey, and Young Kim of California.Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said “complicated political tetris” is likely to emerge as lawmakers negotiate the reconciliation bill.“The caucus that has called for (the cap’s) elimination over the past years has only gotten louder and more vocal and see this year as the opportunity to flex their muscle,” Snyderman said.",,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

(Photo by Wes Muller/LA Illuminator, Saturday Aug. 29, 2020.)Louisiana lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday that would prohibit roofing contractors from assisting homeowners with insurance claims. It would also stop insurance adjusters from performing construction work in connection with the claims they handle. 
House Bill 121, sponsored by Rep. Roy Daryl Adams, D-Jackson, unanimously cleared the House Committee on Insurance and goes next to the floor for consideration. The proposal is one of dozens that lawmakers have filed, with the backing of insurance companies, in an effort to try to lower coverage premiums in the state.
The bill intends to prevent conflicts of interest with adjusters who are also residential contractors. It would also prohibit roofing contractors from providing, advertising or soliciting insurance claims handling services for their customers. Roofers would further have to end the use of contingency contracts in which they agree to perform work only if the homeowner’s insurance company approves the cost. 
Adams said he hopes his measure will stop contractors from going door to door after a storm to talk homeowners into filing insurance claims for roof work.
Several committee members praised the bill and asked Adams to amend it so that it applies to all types of construction contractors and subcontractors. However, several roofers testified in opposition to the proposal.  
Josh Lovell, a sales manager with Gator Roofing in Baton Rouge, said the bill would essentially make it illegal for him to help customers with a task they often want help with. Insurance companies will sometimes deny claims and leave homeowners unaware that they can challenge the denial or ask for a second opinion, which contractors can provide, he said. 
“If we can’t even talk about any of the process, then you’re just giving all the power to the insurance company,” Lovell said. “And do you trust insurance companies like that?”
Johnathan Davis, a board member with the Residential Roofing Association of Louisiana, said contingency agreements and working with insurance companies are a vital part of his profession.

“I know there are good and bad companies just like every industry,” Davis said. “I think that this would hurt everybody — not just the bad actors.”
Committee Chairman Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, who works as an insurance consultant, said it’s wrong for contractors to assist homeowners with insurance claims because it’s not within their area of expertise. 
“That is outside of what you’re licensed to do,” Firment said. “There’s other avenues for the homeowner to take if there’s a dispute.”
There is a “big problem” with shady contractors in the roofing industry who find damage where none actually exists, Firment added. 
“I think we’ve got to get back to roofers being tradesmen and not salesmen,” he said.
Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, who owns an insurance agency, echoed Firment’s statements, pointing out that homeowners can hire public adjusters to handle any disputes that might arise. Public adjusters are independent claims assessors whom policyholders can hire to represent their interests as opposed to adjusters who work on behalf of insurance companies. They typically charge homeowners a fee of around 15% of the final settled claim amount. 
Davis with the roofers’ association challenged the lawmakers’ stance, saying adjusters are experts in interpreting insurance policies but are not generally the most knowledgeable on roof construction and damage assessments. Many homeowners are hesitant to hire a public adjuster because it can be costly, usually escalates the claim and adds another layer to the process, he said. 
The bill’s provisions are so ambiguous, according to Davis, they could make it illegal for roofers just to send damage estimates to an insurance adjuster. 
“I don’t want to be in court one day defending sending an … estimate to an adjuster,” he said.
Lovell said he would be afraid to even say the word “insurance” in the presence of a customer if the bill becomes law. 
Hearing their concerns, Firment said the bill might need to be amended to better define some provisions so roofers aren’t blocked from offering some of their routine services.

(Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The director of South Carolina’s prisons agency is expected to be the state’s next U.S. attorney, sources have confirmed to the SC Daily Gazette.
Bryan Stirling’s new job was first reported by The State newspaper, citing anonymous sources. The Gazette was able to confirm with two sources with knowledge of the move.
The announcement, planned for Monday, comes two months after President Donald Trump’s administration removed Adair Ford Boroughs as the state’s lead federal prosecutor, a role she had filled since July 2022. Boroughs’ assistant attorney Brook Andrews has been acting U.S. attorney since.
SC’s U.S. attorney removed by Trump administration

Stirling will begin as interim attorney Monday. The Trump administration is expected to officially nominate him as U.S. attorney after that, sources said.
Stirling, 55, has overseen the state’s 21 prisons since 2013, when then-Gov. Nikki Haley nominated him to the position. The Department of Corrections has more than 3,700 employees responsible for caring for more than 16,000 inmates.
As prisons director, Stirling has cracked down on contraband coming into prisons, including pushing for a change in federal law to make inmates’ illicit cellphones useless. He successfully asked legislators to raise pay for corrections officers in an effort to recruit and retain them. And he oversaw a number of programs meant to keep inmates from returning to prison after release.
Stirling also led the department through a 2018 prison riot that left seven inmates dead and the restarting of executions after 13 years, including the first conducted by firing squad in state history.
As interim U.S. attorney, Stirling would be in charge of 140 employees responsible for criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuits across the state.
Stirling’s name was among those floated for the position during Trump’s first term.
Trump eventually nominated Columbia attorney Sherri Lydon, who was in the position for less than two years. Her successor, Peter McCoy, was confirmed in June 2020 and stepped down eight months later at the request of the Biden administration.
Stirling has a long background in South Carolina government.
Before becoming director of the state’s prison system, Stirling was Haley’s chief of staff.
Prior to that, he was deputy attorney general during Gov. Henry McMaster’s two terms as attorney general.
A Boston native, Stirling received both his bachelor’s degree (1991) and his law degree (1996) from the University of South Carolina. He spent a decade working for private firms before becoming a public prosecutor.
Soon after Boroughs’ exit was announced, McMaster told reporters he thought Stirling would be a good choice to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
“He really is an extraordinary man,” McMaster said at the time. “He would be excellent in any office.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_7225-scaled-e1702068651380-1024x780.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) rallies outside the State House to voice her support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Maine Constitution on March 4, 2025. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The latest attempt to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the Maine Constitution has all but failed, though a procedural move on Thursday technically leaves it in limbo until appropriations are settled at the end of session. 
Constitutional amendments are ultimately decided by the voters but first need to receive the support of two-thirds of the Maine Legislature. On Wednesday, the House voted 74-65 to enact the measure, failing to meet that threshold. 
The reason Republicans were opposed: gender identity. 
“The question before us is not whether equality matters,” Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) said on the House floor on April 17. “It’s whether this amendment helps or harms that cause, and I submit that it does more harm than good.”
The proposed amendment would prohibit “the denial or abridgment by the state or any political subdivision of the state of equal rights based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, physical or mental disability, ancestry or national origin of an individual.”
Echoing prominent opposition to the federal Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, several of the Republicans who voted against the measure claimed it was a threat to women’s rights because of the protections it would afford against discrimination based on gender identity, which is a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act. 
Gender identity has become a major flashpoint in Maine since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless the state complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing in girls’ sports. 
The state is currently being sued by the Department of Justice and has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory. The Legislature is also considering a few individual bills to restrict transgender students’ access to sports, bathrooms and locker rooms.
Despite this new context, state efforts to pass an ERA are longstanding. 
LD 260, proposed by Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York) and more than 90 Democratic and independent co-sponsors, continues the work of the late state Rep. Lois Galgay Reckitt, who pressed for a state ERA for five decades, with the last attempt failing to pass in 2023 during her final term in the Maine Legislature.
On the House floor on April 17, Sargent argued constitutions are not static documents. 
“Our Constitution began with a narrow vision of to whom equal rights were given,” Sargent said. “But our national and state constitutions are living evolving and expanding pronouncements of what Americans believe throughout our history. Our constitutions have gradually redefined who is worthy of all of the rights to be bestowed and who can be excluded, who is viewed as less than human.”
Lawmakers are not considering with this bill whether to enshrine rights in the Constitution, said Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), but rather whether to let the voters decide. 
“I, for one, am not afraid of the will of the people,” Roeder said, “and I hope the rest of this body will join me in that.”
The Democratic majority in the lower chamber did. But instead of casting an enactment vote on Thursday, the Senate sent the legislation to the “Appropriations Table.” This is typical for constitutional amendments, as they will have fiscal notes associated with election costs. 
If bills aren’t explicitly funded in the state budget, they need to be paid for using remaining unappropriated money, which is divided up usually near the end of session when the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee “runs the table.” 
While bills placed on the table can still pass, precedent shows that most will die, left on the table without final action by the time the Legislature adjourns. Regardless, initial votes in both chambers and the enactment vote in the House signal the two-thirds threshold will not be reached even if appropriators do eventually decide to take it off the table.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)Chris Marshall took care to cast a ballot last fall while in France tending to his business, and was surprised to find months after the 2024 election that Judge Jefferson Griffin wanted his vote thrown out. 
Griffin challenged Marshall and thousands of other military and overseas absentee voters who did not provide photo ID with their ballots. The State Board of Elections did not require it. Most military and civilian overseas voters cast ballots using a special portal that does not provide a way to include a photo. 
Griffin worked to have their votes in the Supreme Court race tossed, but the state Supreme Court said they should have a chance to submit IDs.  
Now back home in Durham, Marshall and his wife Moira Smullen tried to address the problem by checking to see if they could submit photos using the same electronic portal they used to vote. They couldn’t.
“Right now, it’s just wait and see what happens,” he said. 
Phoebe Zerwick, director of the Journalism Program at Wake Forest University, was teaching in Venice when she voted last year. She researched ways to vote before she left North Carolina. She cast her ballot electronically, relieved that she didn’t have to depend on the Italian postal system. She didn’t know her vote was being challenged until after Christmas.
Marshall, Zerwick and other voters — it’s still unclear how many — are trapped in electoral limbo. They’re waiting on the sidelines while court fights with more twists and hairpin turns than a rollercoaster run through state and federal courts. 
The outcome will determine whether they or any of the military and overseas voters whom Griffin is challenging will have to provide a photo ID in order for their votes to count in the Supreme Court race. 
It’s been a long ride. 
Where things stand
Nearly six months after the election, major questions remain unanswered. It’s not certain that overseas voters will have to provide photo ID. 
Griffin, a Republican Court of Appeals judge, is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs for a place on the state’s high court. He trails by 734 votes and tried to convince state courts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his attempt to win.

The state Supreme Court decided earlier this month that the biggest stack of votes Griffin challenged for what he said were incomplete voter registrations should be counted. But the court majority said overseas and military voters should have provided photo ID last fall, even though the state Board of Elections said they didn’t need to. 
The North Carolina law covering military and overseas absentee voters is patterned on a federal law that exempts them from photo ID requirements. But the Supreme Court majority agreed with Griffin that the state voter ID law applies to all.  
Those voters would have 30 days from the point the elections board sends them notices to provide ID or submit a form stating why they cannot, the court ordered. 
The court majority also decided that a few hundred voters whom Griffin classified as “never residents” should not have their votes counted in the race. These voters were described as people who have never lived in the state but are connected to North Carolina through their parents.

However, a reporter writing for The Assembly found that some of the voters on Griffin’s “never residents” list live in North Carolina.
Immediately after the April 11 state Supreme Court decision, Riggs appealed in federal court. Federal District Court Judge Richard Myers II told the state Board of Elections to prepare to follow the state order, but this Tuesday a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals panel approved Riggs’ request for a stay and told the board to stop what it was doing, at least temporarily. 
The Board of Elections last week told Myers it would instruct only Guilford County to contact its 1,409 military and overseas voters about providing a photo ID. The only Griffin protest of overseas and military absentee voters submitted by the legal deadline concerned Guilford, a lawyer for the board wrote. 
The board is working with a vendor to adapt the electronic portal to accept IDs, its lawyer told the judge. 
The 260 “never residents” registered in 53 counties in Griffin’s protests would get the chance to prove that they had lived there, the board’s lawyer told the judge. 
Griffin doesn’t like the board’s plan. He wants military and overseas voters from six counties — Durham, Forsyth, New Hanover, Cumberland, and Buncombe, along with Guilford — to be required to provide ID and asked the state Court of Appeals to make the state Board do it. In a court filing, Griffin’s lawyers said the protests were filed on time, even though they didn’t have voter names. Griffin also objected to the state board giving “never residents” a chance to prove that they lived in the state because the court did not say those voters could “cure” their ballots. Griffin wants “never resident” votes from all 100 counties deleted.
No official notice to individual voters yet
While the court fight occupies both state and federal courts, the State Board of Elections told county elections officials to sit tight. Local administrators were told not to contact overseas or military voters about IDs because the litigation is ongoing. The board does, however, have information for voters on its website.

Voters may choose to submit copies of their IDs or ID exception forms to their county board offices. Counties were instructed to store them in a secure place.
The state Democratic Party is not waiting. It plans to start calling voters on Friday, according to an email to supporters and posts on X.
Zerwick is considering a trip to her county elections board with her husband, whose vote is also being challenged, to show their IDs. 
“I’m uneasy waiting for whatever the process is going to be,” she said. “I’d like to get that over and done with.”
Zerwick has been following the lawsuits and appeals, but she’s worried about Wake Forest students and students from other universities who voted while they were studying abroad.
Most of the counties where Griffin is challenging overseas and military absentee voters are home to major universities. In a few weeks, most students will be leaving school for the summer. 
“Students don’t check email over the summer to receive instructions,” Zerwick said. 
Duke University students studying abroad last fall had detailed instructions on how to vote. Nevertheless, 264 Duke students face challenges for not showing ID.
Olivia Schramkowski, a Duke University junior, created a voting guide for Duke students studying abroad last year as part of her work with the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke and NC Central University. The state Board of Elections told her, through an email to university administration, that they did not need photo ID. 
Schramkowski herself voted last year while studying abroad. She heard about the Griffin challenges, but a search for her name on his original challenge list came up blank. “I thought I was good to go,” she said. 
Later, she Googled her name as part of a class assignment. It popped up in a Wake County court case she knew nothing about. She clicked on a list of challenged voters and found her name. 
Schramkowski spoke to someone on Wednesday who didn’t know their vote was being challenged. She too worries about students leaving campus without knowing their votes may be in jeopardy. 
Although she’s heard that third parties are trying to track down students, “there are massive gaps in communication,” she said. “There’s a big concern on my part that students’ votes won’t count if we won’t be in the state over the summer.”
A voter assistance hotline (888-687-8683) is already getting calls and texts from folks with questions about where Griffin’s challenges stand and what they can do to make sure their votes count.
Katelin Kaiser, policy director at Democracy North Carolina, said parents whose children are overseas have been calling for advice on how to protect their children’s votes. 
People need help navigating “this really complicated — unfairly complicated — situation,” she said. 
Marshall will be traveling back and forth to Europe this year, all the while waiting for instructions.  
“It’s important that our vote counts,” he said.
“It’s fascinating and interesting and scary all at the same time, these games that they’re playing,” Marshall said. “It’s really shocking and just blatantly disregarding the law.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4267-1024x502.jpg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

State officials gathered at the East Camden Bypass this week to highlight the importance of driver safety during National Work Zone Awareness Week, an annual campaign aimed at reducing crashes and fatalities in highway work zones.
Secretary of Transportation Shanté Hastings, joined by Representative Lyndon Yearick, Delaware State Police Lieutenants India Sturgis and Mark Dawson, and DelDOT workers, emphasized the risks road crews face daily and called on drivers to slow down and stay alert.
“Over the past three years, 65 DelDOT employees have been injured in work zone crashes and of those 65, 13 were seriously injured,” Hastings said. “When you see the signs, when you see the flashing lights, when you see the barrels and cones, slow down, eliminate distractions, stay alert, and be extra cautious. By doing these things, motorists can help reduce work zone crashes on our roadways. Please keep our employees safe so they can go home to their families, too,” continued Secretary Hastings.

This year’s campaign theme, “Respect the zone, so we all get home,” underscores the life-and-death stakes of inattentive driving in work zones.
Though highway workers are especially vulnerable, data shows that drivers and their passengers account for about 80% of work zone crash fatalities.
According to national statistics, an average of one highway worker and seven motorists are killed each week in the U.S. due to work zone crashes.
Speeding, tailgating, and distracted driving are among the most common causes.
Officials also reminded the public of simple safety tips, such as obeying signage, avoiding lane changes, maintaining a safe following distance, and reducing speed—especially when approaching toll booths or active construction zones.
First observed in 1999, National Work Zone Awareness Week is a collaborative effort between the Federal Highway Administration, American Traffic Safety Services Association, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Since its inception, the initiative has grown to include state agencies and advocacy groups nationwide.

Michael Bennet of Colorado speaks during a town hall at Colorado Mesa University’s Asteria Theater in Grand Junction on Wednesday. (Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado held a town hall meeting Wednesday in Grand Junction, where he fielded questions regarding education, potential changes in voter registration, the wrongful deportation and imprisonment of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, and what Democrats in power are doing to rein in President Donald Trump. 
Approximately 850 people registered for the event, according to Bennet’s deputy communications director Eric Jones. The event took place at Colorado Mesa University’s Asteria Theater.
Earlier this month the Democratic senator declared his candidacy for Colorado governor — which means there will be a primary race between Bennet and another prominent Democrat, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, for the party’s nomination. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has served as governor since 2019, is term-limited. Weiser announced his candidacy in January and is currently serving his second term as attorney general.

Though personable and humorous at times, Bennet did not give direct answers to many of the audience questions, which were selected via “raffle tickets” offered to attendees as they entered the theater. 
One woman expressed concern about funding for public schools — which is a top issue for Bennet, the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools. He circled back to the topic of education several times during the one-hour town hall. Bennet said there needs to be a serious conversation about improving teacher salaries, how the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights operates, and funding for both K-12 education and health care in the state.
“I think (education) is the most important issue we are facing,” he said. 
Another woman told Bennet how she was “petrified” that the SAVE Act could take away a women’s right to vote. The U.S. House of Representatives this month passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Opponents of the bill say it would make it difficult to vote for women who have changed their name after marriage. 
Women won the right to vote in 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The women fighting for that right never gave up, Bennet said.
“We have to keep (the suffrage movement) in our minds and be inspired by it,” Bennet said.

Another person asked if the money spent on housing prisoners in El Salvador was approved by Congress, to which Bennet responded, “No, to my knowledge Congress has not authorized money.” The Trump administration is paying El Salvador to incarcerate prisoners like Abrego Garcia and Trump has suggested “homegrown” American citizens could be sent there, too.
One man, who addressed the senator as “Governor Bennet” — eliciting a smattering of cheers and applause — asked Bennet why he is running for governor. 
“Like everybody else I am searching my conscience … and thinking about where I can make the biggest difference,” Bennet said.
Bennet was also asked why Democrats have not been able to fight the Trump agenda. 
Bennet responded that while there are many things he blames Trump for, getting elected is not one of them. He said he is frustrated with the Democratic Party for not articulating a compelling vision of what it stands for. Democrats failed to build a coalition that could win in November, he said. Plus, Trump tapped into Americans’ frustration regarding the economy.
Rose Ericson, of Grand Junction, is a Republican who attended the town hall on Wednesday. She told Newsline that she was there because many people feel the Democrats are not doing enough to hold Trump accountable and that the U.S. Congress has the “purse strings” and has given away its control. Ericson did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020.
“They’ve thrown away the checks and balances that were built into the Constitution, and it’s appalling,” she said.
Some in the audience mentioned fears about Social Security, including the possible closure of the agency’s offices and loss of the ability to communicate with a live person. Bennet said he’s all for reforming the government, but sending Elon Musk and his young staff to do it is probably not a good idea. Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency has interfered with government agencies including the Social Security Administration, threatening its operations through cuts to the workforce and offices across the country.
Another person, who works in the trucking industry and is often at truck stops, asked Bennet how to combat what he characterized as lies put out by Fox News, to which Bennet responded that dealing with propaganda is a “big worry” — and not just from domestic sources, but also from China and Russia. 
Another woman told Bennet the “authoritarian” Trump administration is a “nightmare” and asked why Democrats aren’t doing more to stop the president. She also wanted to know what Bennet and other Democrats are doing to bring Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador. The Trump administration has admitted it made an administrative error when it deported Abrego Garcia, but thus far it has ignored a court order to facilitate his return.
Bennet agreed Abrego Garcia should be returned to the United States. He said he personally doesn’t have the power to bring him back home but that Trump should obey the court ruling. 
Bennet told attendees to resist, to push back against threats to democracy, which prompted one person to respond that people can only push back so much and that “we need to know how you Dems are pushing back. What is going on?”
Bennet replied, “First of all, any ideas you have I’ll take. But we have pushed back. Can I do a better job? I’m sure of that. We all bear a responsibility.”
As Bennet was leaving the stage, shaking hands, greeting constituents, a reporter asked why he voted to confirm Doug Burgum as secretary of Interior. 
Burgum issued an order last week that overhauls the organization of the Interior Department, turning over decision-making authority to a DOGE staff member.
Bennet said he voted for Burgum, former governor of North Dakota, because he was a successful Western governor and businessman.
“We had a conversation about public lands in Colorado. I thought it was important to have with a few of these nominees a connection with Colorado. There’s a handful I voted for because I think in the long term they’ll be good for Colorado,” Bennet said.
Both U.S. senators from Colorado — Bennet and Democrat John Hickenlooper — have disappointed some progressives for their votes in favor of confirming some of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. 
Colorado Newsline reached out to Weiser for comment regarding his own bid for governor of Colorado. 
“For the past eight years, I’ve spent every day fighting for Coloradans and our way of life,” Weiser said in an email to Newline. “Senator Bennet has been in Washington on the front lines, which is where we need him to be, especially now. But I continue to be alarmed at Trump’s cabinet choices — including those whom Bennet voted for. Doug Burgum, for instance, has said out loud his plans to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder. Now is not the time for ‘picking our battles’ when it comes to Trump’s all-out assault on our country and our Constitution.”

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)A judge has issued a temporary restraining order allowing a Marshall University graduate student to stay in the country after the Trump administration said it was canceling his student visa. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed the lawsuit against administration officials on behalf of S.V., who is a citizen of India. S.V. was weeks away from graduating with a data science degree when he got word that the Trump administration was revoking his student visa. He later learned that he was “identified in a criminal records check,” an ACLU news release said.
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press.  That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. 
S.V. was sentenced to probation in 2020 in Indiana for operating a vehicle under the influence, a misdemeanor, according to the ACLU. He left the United States and returned in 2023 to study at Marshall. The ACLU argues that having been identified in a criminal record check is not legal ground for terminating a visa.  
In the order Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Chambers ordered the Trump administration to restore S.V.’s F-1 student visa status and prohibit officials from arresting, detaining or transferring him out of the court’s jurisdiction. 
“ACLU-WV won’t stop fighting until his status is permanently restored,” the organization said in a statement. 
The judge has set a hearing in the case for 10 a.m. May 7 at the federal court house in Huntington.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A majority of Americans fear a constitutional crisis is developing from the ongoing conflicts between the Trump Administration and the courts, according to a national survey released Thursday by the Elon University Poll. 
Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has worked to concentrate power, signing 130 executive orders so far. Critics are challenging some of those orders as unconstitutional.
The policy journal Just Security had documented 206 legal challenges against Trump administration actions as of April 22, the Elon press release noted. 
Forty-six percent of Elon poll respondents said the president has too much power compared to the other branches of government, while 38% said he has the right amount, and 5% said he had too little. 
There’s a partisan split in the responses, with 79% of Democrats saying the president had too much power, and 67% of Republicans saying he has the right amount. A slim majority of independents said he has too much power. 
Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed said they were concerned about “a situation in which the executive branch and the courts strongly disagree over their constitutional powers and neither side backs down—creating a crisis over who has the final say.”
A majority, 54%, said the executive branch should not have the authority to ignore or override court rulings. The partisan breakdown on that question was 78% of Democrats, 53% of independents, and 33% of Republicans saying the executive branch should not have the authority to ignore the courts. 
The poll found Trump’s approval rating slipping, with 41% approving of the job he’s doing and 47% disapproving. That compares with a 45% approval to 41% disapproval rating from the February poll.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)People needing assistance in Spanish from the Florida Department of Children and Families wait on hold for nearly an hour, according to a report from the Hispanic civil rights group UnidosUS.
The wait time for the call center, which fields questions about government cash and food assistance programs and Medicaid, has improved since the group started monitoring its efficacy in the summer of 2023.
Still, UnidosUS found that Spanish speakers deal with an average wait time of 54 minutes, whereas the wait averages 13 minutes for English speakers.

Thursday’s report is the third the group has published about the wait times, starting as the state began disenrolling millions from Medicaid following the end of the federal COVID-19 public health emergency.
While the wait time for Spanish speakers has gone down from 120 minutes in 2023 to 56 minutes, 45% of the calls the group made got dropped before reaching a live agent. Between September and February, UnidosUS made 174 calls to the English and Spanish lines at various times of the day.
By comparison, only 5% of the calls seeking assistance in English were disconnected, according to the report. The wait time for English speakers went down from 34 minutes in 2023 to 13 minutes between September and February.
DCF’s call center wait times have drawn scrutiny, with Floridians facing the second-longest wait time in the country last year. Concerns from lawmakers led to an investment of $12 million into improving the call center at the time.
Jared Nordlund, UnidosUS’ Florida director, said the group is advocating for DCF to hire more bilingual call center agents.
“Clearly, the money we advocated for last session to beef up call centers worked,” Nordlund said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix. “This has worked really well for English speakers, so clearly there needs to be more work done to help Spanish speakers.”
Additionally, testimony during a federal trial in Jacksonville last year revealed the department had blocked 54% of phone calls from people wanting to reach one of its call center agents that April.
Inefficiencies within the call center played a key role in the class action filed by Medicaid patients alleging Florida violated their constitutional right to due process when it took away their health care coverage without proper notice. Plaintiffs argued during the trial that call center agents gave them wrong information about their Medicaid eligibility.
At the time, the director of the call center testified that DCF planned to hire hundreds more people to handle the calls.

Five international students, all connected to Missouri campuses, have sued the Trump administration over their terminated student record, which could threaten their ability to legally remain in the United States (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).Five international college students in Missouri have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination of their student registrations by the Department of Homeland Security — a revocation that essentially threatens their ability to legally remain in the United States.
The students believe that prior nonviolent incidents might have triggered DHS to revoke their records in a government database that tracks international students.
An international student in Missouri from Nigeria, for example, had once paid a $50 fine for playing music too loudly.
Another student, also from Nigeria, had once been cited for improperly passing a streetcar and paid a $80.50 fine.
And yet another, from Bangladesh, had been charged with public intoxication but believed that the issue was resolved years ago after he completed six months of probation and 75 hours of community service.
The complaint was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri by Kansas City immigration attorney Rekha Sharma-Crawford, who is representing the students.
A hearing April 24 will determine if a request for a temporary restraining order will be granted, said Sharma-Crawford.
The complaint joins a flurry of similar challenges nationwide.
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, there are more than 1 million international students in the U.S.
The American Immigration Lawyers Association has noted that more than 4,700 international students had records that were canceled, according to reporting by Science.
In a separate case brought in Atlanta, a graduate student from Bangladesh studying at Missouri State University was among 133 international students who had their status restored this week after a temporary restraining order was approved.
The students represented in the local lawsuit involve a range of universities and nationalities.

A Nigerian student studying computer science at Truman State University.
A Spanish student at Northwest Missouri State University on a tennis scholarship.
A Nepal graduate student studying at Southeast Missouri State University.
A mechanical engineering graduate from Bangladesh who was employed at a Kansas City company as part of his practical training.
And a Nigerian graduate of the Missouri University of Science and Technology who was employed at a Columbia, Missouri, bank as part of her practical training.

The terminations came “without notice and without cause,” the Missouri suit alleges, and caused immediate and irreparable harm.
“In essence, they took students lawfully here on their student visas and stripped them of their legal status,” the complaint reads. “They did this to create chaos and uncertainty and cause some students to abandon their studies and leave the United States.”
Sharma-Crawford said about 40 such cases have been filed nationwide, challenging the government’s actions targeting international students.
The Missouri complaint is against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security and Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In early April, thousands of foreign college students began discovering that the Trump administration had terminated their student records, which are tracked within DHS by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS.
 Fear of retaliation among international students

The five Missouri students are anonymous in the lawsuit, citing fear of retaliation or harassment and blacklisting by third parties.
The complaint alleges that the students have lost jobs, health care and their student status and suffered stress from not being able to pay for their rent or basic needs, in addition to upending their career goals.
Homeland Security has not initiated removal proceedings, colloquially referred to as deportation, against any of the students, said Sharma-Crawford.
The lawsuit alleges that DHS terminated the students’ registrations without sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard, a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process.
Several of the students had previously left the U.S. and reentered without any issues with U.S. Customs and Border Protection after the minor criminal incidents.
In response to similar court challenges, the government has taken what some see as a contradictory stance, emphasizing that it has merely terminated a record in a government tracking database, nothing more.
And yet, some students have then been advised by emails that they must leave the U.S.
For universities, some do not want to risk their own funding by being accused of harboring an immigrant not legally able to study or reside in the U.S.
Requests for comment from several Missouri university offices that oversee international students were not returned.
There is no publicly accessible database to track the status of international students.
But Inside Higher Ed and The Chronicle of Higher Education have been compiling listings, reporting that at least 1,500 students have been affected as of April 21.
The sites note that Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville had 716 international students last fall and 43 recent revocations.
Other regional campuses listed include: Webster University, with 24 students affected; Missouri State University, with six students affected; and Park University, with at least one student affected.
The Missouri complaint also notes that the students’ schools also were not given a rationale for the decisions.
The five students listed in the lawsuit learned of the terminations from their universities, according to the complaint. School officials received emails advising that ICE had terminated the student’s SEVIS registration.
The complaint also details the process that international students use during their studies:
“Foreign students who wish to study in the United States apply to schools which are part of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (“SEVP”). This program is monitored within the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). ICE, through SEVP, uses the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (“SEVIS”), a government database that tracks international students’ compliance with their student visa status. Student visas are commonly referred to as F-1 visas.”
The complaint alleges: “Yet, each Plaintiff, once terminated in the SEVIS system, even wrongfully, would be left without status and their presence becomes immediately unauthorized. Any work authorization for on and/or off campus is immediately terminated, they are unable to re-enter the U.S. on a terminated SEVIS record and they become subject to arrest, detention and deportation.”
 Court challenges joined by university pushback

U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat, believes that bipartisan leverage might be possible to address unfair targeting of international students.
Davids said some Republicans in the House could be engaged on the issue.
“This is one of those areas where every single state — red states, blue states, it doesn’t matter — they benefit from having robust universities,” Davids said during a town hall hosted by KCUR on April 21.
She added that in some areas with Republican representation the affected universities are “the economic driver of their communities.”
Universities nationwide have been under intense scrutiny by the Trump administration.
Some have seen grants canceled, often involving research, with the allegation that an institution hadn’t done enough to protect Jewish students from antisemitism that allegedly occurred during student protests against Palestinian deaths in Gaza that were inflicted by the U.S.-backed Israeli military.
Critics allege that President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants now appears to include gathering up those legally present, or maneuvering to alter their status and encourage self-deportation, without due process.
The American Association of Colleges and Universities released “A call for constructive engagement” on April 22, signed by more than 100 college and university presidents, including President Fred P. Pestello of Saint Louis University.
The lengthy statement sought to “speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education.”
“Our colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.”

In its original state, Senate Bill 2 by Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, would have prohibited public water systems from fluoridating their water, which is done to prevent tooth decay. The practice began in the United States in the 1940s and is widely supported by major dental and medical associations. 
The Senate Health and Welfare Committee amended the bill to allow fluoridation only if voters approve, which would involve what committee chair and bill co-author Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, described as an “incredibly difficult” process. 
The legislation advanced after the committee approved the amendments, which Sen. Gerald Beaudreaux, D-Lafayette, put forward before ultimately voting against the bill. The changes would allow local residents to vote on whether they want their system to be fluoridated, but only after at least 15% of voters the system services petition for the election. 
McMath likened it to the process for recalling an elected official, a very burdensome process that rarely succeeds in Louisiana. 
The bill, which Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham supports, is based on the premise that fluoride is harmful. In high doses, the chemical, like many others, can cause adverse health effects. But at the amount present in American water systems, there is scant evidence fluoride presents a health risk. 
“Too much or too little of anything is bad for you, including vitamins and water,” said Anne Jayes, senior policy manager with the Louisiana Public Health Institute. “Too little [fluoride] can lead to poor dental hygiene, cavities and poor bone health, including osteoporosis.”
At the recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per liter of water, fluoride strengthens teeth and helps prevent decay, especially in communities where access to dental care is limited, Jayes added. 
In places where fluoride has been removed from the water systems, studies have found drastic increases in pediatric dental complications. After Calgary Canada stopped fluoridating its water in 2011, a decision it reversed in 2021, there was a 700% increase in the number of children receiving IV antibiotics at a local hospital for dental infections and abscesses. 
Annette Droddy, executive director of the Louisiana Dental Association, represents nearly 2,000 dentists in Louisiana. She warned the passage of the bill would lead to an increase in state spending for its Medicaid dental program. 
The bill will next be debated by the Senate.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Opponents to two new natural gas plants proposed by Evergy testified Wednesday about uncertain costs of natural gas and pushed the Kansas Corporation Commission to consider other options for expanding power generation in the state.
During the third day of KCC hearings, Nick Jones, a senior analyst at New Energy Economics, told commissioners he had the “dubious distinction” of being the only person in the room to have worked as a natural gas forecaster.
“I’m familiar with some of the pitfalls and some of the risks in trying to forecast natural gas that far in advance,” he said, referring to projected costs that will be incurred for Evergy natural gas plants expected to go into service in 2029 and 2030.
Jones said the U.S. Energy Information Administration has “substantially” revised its forecast for natural gas prices expected in the 2030s in its most recent energy outlook report.
“It’s now significantly above the mid-case (price) that Evergy has proposed in this docket,” he said, referring to low, mid- and high-case projections made by Evergy for natural gas costs.
Supporting his concerns, Jones said, a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City of leading energy producers also predicted increases in natural gas costs in the coming years.
“Now all of these are just data points. I don’t think any of those are definitive, but I do see that the early signals indicate that there is upside risk in the natural gas market, and that the commission should take seriously the potential that these plants could be operating in a scenario closer to the high gas scenario that Evergy modeled, and potentially even beyond that,” Jones said.
 
Natural gas volatility
In written, prefiled testimony, Jones said Evergy failed to account for natural gas price volatility in its supply plan, which showed purchasing natural gas in a manner similar to purchasing coal.
“Natural gas cannot be easily stockpiled on site, as is common practice for coal,” Jones’ written testimony said. “Nor can natural gas be delivered through multiple modes of transport, as can be done for coal. Nor is natural gas marketed almost exclusively to the power sector, as is the case for thermal coal. In contrast to coal markets, natural gas markets rely on centralized storage and delivery to end-users via pipelines.”
Those and other factors Jones listed in testimony mean natural gas is a “just-in-time” fuel for which the timing and volume of deliveries must coincide exactly with the needs of the power plant.
“Therefore, procuring natural gas inherently requires more sophisticated methods and leaves less room for error than procuring coal,” he said during Wednesday’s hearing.
Jones primarily focused on the need for more diversification in Evergy’s portfolio than what the natural gas plants would add, and he questioned whether commissioners should approve the second natural gas plant at this time.
“I’m not, you know, going to sit here and claim that batteries are a one-to-one swap for natural gas or that there’s some kind of panacea,” he said. “All these options have advantages and drawbacks, but one thing that we can say for sure is that the more diversity that there is in Evergy’s expansion plans, the less that they will be exposed to any particular risk, and that includes the risk of high natural gas prices.”
 
Outdated model
The second and final witness Wednesday was Lucy Metz, an associate with Synapse Energy Economics testifying for the Citizens Utility Ratepayer Board. On Tuesday, KCC’s Justin Grady, deputy director of utilities, criticized Metz’s focus on adding battery storage, saying it did not mesh with the Integrated Resource Plan that Every is required to file. The IRP lays out the company’s projections for market needs and how it will meet them.
“Market conditions have changed significantly since Evergy developed that 2024 IRP preferred portfolio, and in particular, the relative cost of different replacement resources has changed significantly,” Metz said Wednesday. “It no longer makes sense under these new and current conditions we face for Evergy to forge ahead with that outdated preferred portfolio, which may no longer represent the most cost effective and the lowest risk option for ratepayers.”
Metz said that Evergy did offer updated modeling for the current docket, addressing some of those concerns, but she still felt it did not adequately address market changes.
“I have a number of concerns with this updated modeling, including that Evergy did not account for the future risk of operational restrictions on the combined cycle units from environmental regulations,” she said.
Metz questioned whether Evergy considered the “full range” of resource options before moving forward with proposals for the natural gas plants. She listed converting more of its coal units to gas, for example, to give the company additional time before adding a large resource addition like the proposed plants.
“I believe that if Evergy had corrected these shortcomings, it’s very likely that the model would no longer have selected that 2030 (combined cycle natural gas plant) and would have gone with some of those other alternatives instead,” she said. “And I really sympathize with staff’s instinct in this time of uncertainty related to political headwinds and tariffs and trade wars to lock in this generation. But I just think that perspective really ignores some other categories of risk that ratepayers will be very exposed to.”
 
Addressing uncertainty
Given the current tariff and generally uncertain environment, Metz said, she believes one of the best ways to protect ratepayers would be to select a portfolio that will “be robust across that uncertainty, no matter how things turn out with the tariffs.”
“So it’s really not clear at this moment what the net effect across all the different energy supply chains will be of these tariffs threats, but if Evergy builds the combined cycle units, it will be locking repairs into these very large assets that will then rely on gas over their entire lifetime, and the tariffs could affect gas prices as well,” she said. “Whereas more modular and incremental resource additions, such as batteries or solar energy, can really adapt as it goes, and while tariffs may affect capital costs of these resources, once they’re built, they will have no fuel costs, and so rate payers will no longer be exposed to that uncertainty.”
The predetermination hearing ended after Metz’s testimony. Commissioner Andrew French said the KCC would reach its decision by July 7.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P1010038-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-24 11:08:50.552837

SPRINGFIELD – Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton is the first Democrat to step into what is expected to be a crowded race to fill Sen. Dick Durbin’s Senate seat.

SPRINGFIELD – Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton is the first Democrat to step into what is expected to be a crowded race to fill Sen. Dick Durbin’s Senate seat.

Stratton launched her campaign Thursday morning in a video just one day after Durbin announced he will not seek reelection for a seat he has held since 1997.

“As Donald Trump and Elon Musk continue their relentless attack on Americans, we need new voices in Washington who will stand firm and fight fiercely to move us forward and protect the values we hold dear,” Stratton said in a statement.

Stratton has quickly risen through the ranks in Illinois politics. After serving one term in the Illinois House, Gov. JB Pritzker tapped her to be his running mate during the 2018 campaign. She took over as lieutenant governor alongside Pritzker in 2019, and the pair were reelected in 2022.

Stratton has notably appeared alongside Pritzker at more events in recent months. In her announcement video, she highlighted the accomplishments of Pritzker’s administration.

“(Republicans) like to talk. We’ve actually gotten things done,” Stratton said.

Pritzker praised Stratton but declined to endorse her, at least for now, during an unrelated news conference Thursday morning.

""She is truly one of the most accomplished people that's ever held the job of lieutenant governor,” Pritzker said. “She's done so much as a partner in governance in the state. As you know, I think very highly of her.”

Stratton, 59, who hails from Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood, said her path to become a candidate for U.S. Senate isn’t “typical.” She said she wanted to enter politics after being the primary caregiver for her mother, who battled Alzheimer's disease.

Stratton won an expensive race for the Illinois House in 2016, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep. Ken Dunkin, who sometimes sided with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner during the state’s two-year budget impasse that began in 2015.

Stratton’s professional background includes working as director of the University of Illinois Chicago’s Center for Public Safety and Justice.

Stratton has followed in Pritzker’s shadow as the governor has received accolades from Democrats for raising the minimum wage to $15, banning assault weapons and shoring up abortion protections after Roe v. Wade was struck down in 2022.

But especially in recent months, Stratton has sought to raise her own profile in state politics. She launched the Level Up federal political action committee in January, giving her a financial mechanism to influence federal campaigns or support her own run for office. The committee had not reported any fundraising as of Thursday.

Durbin, 80, announced Wednesday that he will retire when his term ends in 2027 after 44 years in Congress, including the last two decades as the Democratic whip in the Senate.

Durbin told WBEZ-FM radio in Chicago that “at least a dozen” candidates have expressed interest in his seat.

“We are also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,” Durbin said. “We need them now more than ever.”

(Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)This story first appeared on the Oregon Capital Chronicle.
Twelve states are suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the United States.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed Wednesday by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont — are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China, a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Oregon Attorney General’s Office.
“​​We cannot sit quietly while the president takes actions that are going to cost us jobs, increase the prices that we pay, and harm our economy,” Rayfield told reporters Wednesday at a news conference held at the Oregon Department of Justice in Portland.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Rayfield and the other attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the executive branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“Congress has the sole authority to set tariff policy,” Rayfield said. “Congress has enacted various laws that allow the president to implement tariffs under certain conditions, but most importantly, certain safeguards. And it’s these conditions and safeguards that the president doesn’t like.”
Employment fears
Rayfield was joined by state Rep. Daniel Nguyễn, D-Lake Oswego, and co-founder of Portland-based Bambuza Vietnam Kitchen; Pat Hubbell, owner of Brooklyn Pharmacy in Portland; Graham Trainor, president of Oregon AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 300,000 unionized Oregonians working in construction, education, health care and manufacturing; Todd Nelson, co-owner of Bountiful Farms in Woodburn; Cody Sullivan, the first person with Down syndrome to graduate with a four-year degree from an Oregon college, and Ann Donaca, Sullivan’s aide and a retired educator.
Trump touts manufacturing while undercutting state efforts to help factories

Nguyễn said Bambuza, like all businesses, is struggling to deal with the economic insecurity wrought by the tariffs. He said the business has stocked many of its Vietnamese imports, such as rice paper, rice noodles and coffee, but he knows they will not last long.
“This survival mentality might save an individual business in a pinch, but it can’t be sustained, and it can be devastating for our broader economy,” he said.
Trainor said Trump’s erratic use of tariffs lacks a clear strategy, making them detrimental rather than beneficial for workers. He said many union members are “wondering if their jobs will still exist tomorrow.”
“What we need is a comprehensive trade policy that puts workers first,” he said. “That means targeting unfair trade practices, investing in domestic industries and ensuring that tariffs are used strategically, not just as political weapons.”
Sullivan has been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for three years. Donaca said that’s only going to get harder in an economy where hiring slows altogether due to economic uncertainty.
Feeling the pain
Both Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small- and medium- business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as next week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

During his campaign, Trump and his supporters made multiple stops in Macomb County, which is known as a major hub for automotive manufacturing and home to a large base of blue collar workers.

Darin Chappell of Rogersville speaks in March 2024 during Missouri House debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Disagreement over two competing versions of legislation designed to “protect ideological perspectives” in college campus-based organizations surfaced during a Senate committee hearing Wednesday.
Both bills were created to prohibit public institutions taking “adverse action” against belief-based organizations. As defined in the bills text, belief-based organizations are, “any political or ideological student association or any religious student association.”
“There is not a single student association in existence that is not protected by this bill,” said state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Rogersvilleand sponsor of the bill. “This bill just simply says that freedom of association is one of the premier fundamental rights of this country, and you do not lose that simply because you enrolled in a higher institution.”
But critics say Chappell’s bill could force schools to support groups that discriminate against students who weren’t allowed to join such groups, such as LGBTQ+ students who could be prohibited from joining certain religious-based groups. They prefer a Senate version of the bill that includes an anti-discriminatory provision.
Both bills prohibit enforcing any policy that denies certain “benefits” to these organizations that are readily available to other student associations.
“Benefits,” as described in the bill, are any type of recognition, registration, use of facilities for meetings or speaking purposes, communication channels that are sanctioned by a public institution of higher learning, other assistance and aid.
The House approved the bill in late February with a vote of 108-47.
Most of the discussion Wednesday centered around the protection of free speech and funding these organizations with student fees.
“We’re not discriminating against anyone,” said state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair. “We’re wanting everyone to have equal protection under the First Amendment as it should be.”
Sharon Jones, who testified in opposition on behalf of the Missouri NAACP State Conference, requested the committee look at the language added to the Senate version of the legislation. It is an anti-discriminatory clause stating that if there is evidence that an organization’s viewpoint would cause campus disruption or “interfere with the rights of others,” the protections would not apply.
If included, Jones said it would, “make us neutral on the bill.”
That sentiment was shared among other witnesses who testified in opposition Wednesday.
“It’s something we think balances the needs of all groups on campus and doesn’t do anything to impact the underlying intent of the two bills,” Jones said.
Another concern brought up by those in opposition was that leadership in university-sanctioned student groups could be restricted to leaders who shared the ideology of those groups.
Chappell said this bill doesn’t mean students “can’t choose their leaders.”
“It means that students cannot be compelled by the university to choose leaders that do not represent their views and desires,” Chappell said. “Not just in religion, but politically, economically (and) sociologically.”

(Photo: Jennifer Solis/Nevada Current)Former Gov. Steve Sisolak and his fellow Democrats in the Nevada Legislature didn’t raise taxes.
But in 2019 they passed a couple bills that tried to maintain some existing taxes.
Neither of the bills they passed had been supported by two-thirds majorities of both houses of the Legislature, as required by the state constitution if enacting any measure that “increases any public revenue in any form.”
So Nevada Republicans sued, and won, and the Democratic effort — not to raise taxes but merely maintain existing ones — was ruled unconstitutional.
Fast forward to today, and Donald Trump, on his own and without consultation or approval from the legislative branch of the U.S. government,  has implemented a series of tax increases on businesses. Those businesses will try hard as they can to pass the cost of those new taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices.
And Nevada Republicans are fine with that.
Taxation by edict
A tariff is a tax. 
Specifically, it’s a tax on imported goods. 
U.S. firms that import goods from abroad are charged a tax based on the value of the import. Businesses pay that tax to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
Tariffs are every bit as much a tax as the sales tax Nevadans pay to state and local governments when they buy clothes or dog food or a car.
When the importer sells those imported goods in the U.S., naturally they try to pass along as much of the cost of the tax to consumers as possible. 
So prices rise.
Because Trump said so.
And Nevada Republicans are fine with that.
Like the state of Nevada, the United States of America has a Constitution, too. And like Nevada’s constitution, the U.S. Constitution also has some rules about raising or increasing government revenue.
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution mandates that “The Congress” — not the president, even if it’s Trump — “shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.” 
Under Section 8, Congress — not Trump — also has the power “To regulate commerce with foreign nations.”
Nevada Republicans threw a hissy fit when Sisolak and Democrats tried to maintain existing taxes without what Republicans believed was proper approval from Nevada’s legislative branch. 
Trump hasn’t given a second thought to the U.S. legislative branch while he has raised taxes, and then paused them, and then raised them, and then exempted some goods from them, etc., in a dizzying array of madcap proclamations. 
A lawsuit against Trump’s lawless acts filed Wednesday by a cadre of Democratic state attorneys general, including Nevada’s Aaron Ford, notes the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act Trump disingenuously cites as legitimizing his one-man tax hike binge only applies when an emergency presents an “unusual and extraordinary threat.”
The only emergency presenting an unusual and extraordinary threat is Trump.
But Republicans who have majorities in both houses of Congress have thus far been fine with that. 
The same goes for Republicans in Nevada.
Strong leadership, NV GOP style: ‘Well, let’s see how it goes’
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did submit a humble plea to Trump last week, beseeching the president to repeal the tax on lithium imported from China. Oddly for someone who is fond of saying “no new taxes” when in front of audiences, Lombardo didn’t object to the import tax because it was a new tax. He objected to it because he fears it will stymie the growth of the state’s nascent lithium recycling and manufacturing industry. 
And although Lombardo has made clear time and again that he devoutly believes the ideal number of new taxes is zero, all he’s said about the threat Trump’s new taxes on imports pose to the the state budget, the state’s economy, and the well-being of his constituents is that Nevada will just have to “make adjustments on the fly.” Which sounds like a conclusion every bit as deliberative as the one behind Trump’s tax on imports to begin with. No wonder the two men endorsed each other.
Ever wary of being outdone in the art of folksy deflection, when asked recently about Trump’s new taxes on imports on KUNR,  Nevada’s only Republican in Congress, Rep. Mark Amodei, customarily filled the air with many words. But a single phrase among them encapsulated the rest: “Well, let’s see how it goes.”
Ask the Nevada State Republican Party (Fake Elector Michael McDonald, proprietor), and they’ll happily tell you that it is those icky Democrats, not the dreamy Republicans, who meekly go along with higher taxes. So even defeating a bill that would not actually raise anyone’s taxes, but would only reset taxable value of homes when they’re resold (to hedge funds, for example), is one of the party’s “top concerns” of this year’s state legislative session, according to a recent party email. 
And yet a scan of statements from the state party over the last several weeks reveals no mention of Trump’s tsunami of new taxes on imports, let alone an objection to Trump raising taxes unilaterally, i.e., by unconstitutional edict.
For the record, and because Trump’s multiple Queen-of-Hearts-style decrees accompanied by rampant flip-floppery can be confusing, the new taxes on imports Trump has proclaimed that are currently in effect include:

10% taxes on nearly all imports from virtually everywhere and anywhere;
25% import taxes on automobiles, auto parts, and multiple other products from Mexico and Canada;
145% import tax on goods from China, except for phones, computers, and the other stuff the tech billionaires instructed Trump not to tax.

Meanwhile, the “Liberation Day” import taxes — the “reciprocal tariffs,” as the grossly inaccurate Trump dubbed them — that threw markets (and your retirement savings) into chaos and prompted even some Trump supporters to shake their heads in disbelief and despair, are scheduled to resume on July 9. 
Unless Trump strikes “beautiful deals” with just about every nation on the planet between now and then. 
Which nobody believes will happen. 
Or unless Trump caves and backs down — as he already did once on the “reciprocal tariffs,” and as he’s indicating he will do for China — but then tries to save face by dialing up some new hare-brained inanity. 
Which everybody assumes will happen.
But as businesses and industries that prize stability will anxiously attest, it’s impossible to know what Trump will do about … anything … because Trump is a volatile and easily triggered scatterbrain who himself has little if any idea what he’s going to do next. 
Meanwhile, the damage Trump has already inflicted not only on the economy but on U.S. global credibility seems deeper, darker, and more irreversible each day. 
Trump is devolving the country into a backwater, an economic and political anachronism that traded its alliances and interconnections with, and leadership of, the world’s wealthiest and most democratic nations for membership in a decadent syndicate of lawless thugs — no longer the most powerful nation the world had ever seen integrally involved in promoting peace, progress, and prosperity, but a menacing carceral state wreaking of despotism and corruption, and shunned and avoided by the peoples of free and law-abiding nations.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered the United States government to pay North Dakota nearly $28 million, finding that the executive branch “abandoned the rule of law” in its response to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests of 2016 and 2017.
In the lawsuit, filed in 2019, North Dakota requested $38 million in damages from the United States government — the total sum it claims it paid for policing and cleaning up the demonstrations.
In a long-awaited decision filed Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor sided with the state, finding the Corps at fault for negligence, public nuisance and civil trespass claims.
“While North Dakota was drowning in the chaos of the protests, the United States dropped an anvil into the pool and turned up the turmoil,” he wrote in a nearly 120-page order.
Thousands came to south-central North Dakota to protest the construction of the crude oil pipeline in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which views the project as a looming environmental hazard and an encroachment upon Native territory. It has also accused the pipeline of disrupting sacred cultural sites.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

Demonstrators set up camp near where the pipeline crosses beneath Lake Oahe — a reservoir on the Missouri River managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers less than a half-mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Opponents urged the Army Corps of Engineers — and later, the federal courts — to deny the pipeline’s developer, Energy Transfer, the land easement necessary to cross Lake Oahe.
The largest demonstration camp was located on land managed by the Corps.
The protests lasted from spring of 2016 to February of 2017, when former Gov. Doug Burgum ordered protesters to evacuate the land.
Traynor wrote the Army Corps was legally required to enforce its property rights as soon as it became aware of the protests — either by requiring the demonstrators to obtain a permit to use its land or forcing the protesters to leave.
Early on in the demonstrations, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was in talks with the Army Corps about obtaining a special use permit, but those negotiations fell through, witnesses testified during the trial last year.
In September 2016, the Corps published a press release stating the permit had been granted, despite that the tribe never completed the application process.
Had the Corps followed through with the permit, the agency could have prevented millions in damages to the state, Traynor continued. Such a permit could have required demonstrators to handle cleanup, incentivized protest leaders to prevent damage to the land and prohibited protesters from establishing permanent structures at the campsites, he reasoned. He said the agency could have closed its land if protesters refused to comply with these requirements.
The Wednesday ruling expands on a prior order published in December 2023, in which Traynor held that the Army Corps had violated its own permitting procedures by not requiring protesters to obtain the permit.
Traynor found that the Corps’ decision to allow protesters to use its land — coupled with the press release, which he characterized as an endorsement of the demonstrations — prolonged and intensified the movement.
The United States argued other factors were responsible for the protest’s rise in popularity, like the Corps’ pending decision on the pipeline easement, the tribe’s historic claims to the land and national media attention. Winona LaDuke, an Indigenous environmental activist, testified during the trial that the Corps’ actions surrounding the permit and press release did not affect her decision to be at the camp, for example.
Traynor in his Wednesday order called these elements “red herrings” and “immaterial” to the Corps’ fault in the protests.
“Certainly, protesters had their own independent incentives for why they protested,” Traynor wrote, “but as discussed above, the facts as adduced at trial show protesters were supported, enabled, and encouraged by the Corps’ granting of the de facto special use permit that gave protesters a refuge from which they could conduct repeated illegal and illicit activities.”
The United States has argued that the Corps responded the best it could in an extraordinary situation, and that it did not know the protests would unfold the way they did.
Traynor in his decision rejected this claim, finding that evidence presented at trial showed that the U.S. government knew early on that the demonstrations could balloon in size and become unruly.
North Dakota on multiple occasions asked for federal law enforcement to assist with managing the demonstrations, which Traynor said indicates the United States was aware that the protests posed a safety threat.
The United States also said that it cannot be held liable for the damages because the protests were protected speech.
Traynor said that while some protesters engaged in protected speech, the damages at issue in the lawsuit are not covered by the First Amendment since they resulted from violent behavior. He also noted the United States cannot use the First Amendment protections as a defense when no protesters are party to the case.
“The damages here were caused by tumultuous, unsanitary, and otherwise horrific conditions that caused significant violence to the land and responding law enforcement officers,” he wrote.

Participants in the protest, including those who testified during the trial, emphasized that not all were violent. Demonstrators also objected to the response of law enforcement in riot gear and tactics of private security personnel.
Traynor reduced the award to North Dakota by $10 million, since the U.S. government had already awarded the state a grant of that size to offset the cost of its emergency response to the protests.
The state also received a $15 million donation from pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners in connection to the protests.
Traynor’s decision comes more than a year after the case went to trial.
During the four-week trial, which kicked off in February 2024, the court heard from a wide-ranging cast of witnesses — including Burgum and former Gov. Jack Dalrymple, Native activists, federal officials and law enforcement.
It was not immediately clear whether the United States government would appeal Traynor’s decision. The Corps did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley called the decision “a major win for North Dakota taxpayers and the rule of law.”
“As outlined in trial testimony and Judge Traynor’s ruling, decisions made by the Obama administration emboldened protesters and ultimately caused millions of dollars in damage to North Dakota, while endangering the health and safety of North Dakota communities, families and law enforcement officers who responded to the protests,” Armstrong and Wrigley said in a joint statement.
Lake Oahe is the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s primary source of water. The pipeline’s path also includes unceded land recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation under an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government.
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been in operation since 2017. In a lawsuit brought against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by Standing Rock in 2016, a federal judge found that the Army Corps had violated the law by granting DAPL an easement without first conducting a full environmental review of the pipeline, which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
The judge vacated the easement and ordered the pipeline to be drained of oil until the Army Corps could complete an environmental impact study. A higher court in 2021 upheld the decision to pull the easement but ruled that DAPL could remain in operation, concluding that Standing Rock had not shown it is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the pipeline is not shuttered.
The environmental impact study is still in progress.
A separate legal challenge brought by Energy Transfer against environmental group Greenpeace related to the DAPL protests went to trial in February. A nine-person jury of Morton County residents found Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages.

(Photo: Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Last Thursday, April 17, 2025, two people were killed and five others wounded in a mass shooting at Florida State University, in Tallahassee.
I am a professor at North Carolina State University, In Raleigh. We have, fortunately, not had a mass shooting on our campus, or perhaps I should say we have not yet had a shooting. We have come close. Last November an NC State student was charged with multiple shootings at vehicles near Interstate 40 in Raleigh. 
We are, ironically, fortunate that the alleged shooter manifested his rage away from our campus. And then, of course, there was the graduate student who shot and killed a professor at UNC Chapel Hill in August 2023, and the mass shooting at UNC Charlotte in 2019.
University campuses are open and welcoming spaces, as we want them to be. But this places our campus communities at some risk. Professors feel responsible for our students. We want to keep them safe, if (or when) there is an active shooter on our campuses.
I am a member of NC State’s faculty Senate (and its incoming chair). In 2023, we asked our university administration if classrooms, especially the large lecture halls that might offer appealing “soft” targets, could have locks installed on their doors, so that we could safely lock down and shelter in place if (or when) there is an active shooter on our campus. We were given many reasons why this was not feasible, but they all boiled down to this: the locks would cost too much.
In February, our faculty Senate returned to this issue. We wrote a memo to our university administration respectfully asking:

For a commitment that all classrooms in new or renovated buildings be lockable from the inside.
For a review of campus lecture spaces, to identify those large spaces that are most vulnerable 
That a plan be developed and implemented by the University to provide inside locks for all campus teaching spaces by August 2030, prioritizing the most vulnerable spaces.
That the design specifications for future buildings consider safety in addition to aesthetics.

So far, no action has been taken, and we have received no response.
Apparently, university leadership is not very worried about the prospect of a mass shooting on our campus.
What are they worried about? Protesters!
In February, the University of North Carolina Board of Governors enacted a system-wide policy that imposes new restrictions on campus protests, most notably requiring 36 hours advance notice for any “mass gathering.”
Apparently, according to our university campus and system leadership, it’s not bullets that will kill and maim my students and me. It’s free speech.
I note that I am, and I look like, a Jew. I have never felt that my safety was compromised by any protest on my campus, including those addressing the war in Gaza.
Under the guise of safety our system leaders signal their disregard for the First Amendment rights of our students. And under the guise of cost and feasibility, they express their disregard for the authentic safety of the campus community.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FSU-mass-shooting.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:09:44.700168

Posing as tourists, the thieves entered the State House late in the afternoon and headed for the fourth-floor gallery overlooking the House chamber. 
The post The case of the State House cod caper  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","While much of the recent drama at the State House has focused on budgets, taxes, and immigration, there was a time when the biggest story under the golden dome was a good old fashioned whodunnit. Former state representative Josh Cutler has written a book chronicling two centuries of State House history. Below is an excerpt on a dramatic theft that occurred 92 years ago this week that once captured the public’s attention. “Steal all the Cabots, if you must, but spare our cods––in cods we trust!” April 26, 1933: Posing as tourists, the thieves entered the State House late in the afternoon and headed for the fourth-floor gallery overlooking the House chamber. Two of the men wore white saddle sport shoes and one carried an unusually long flower box under his arm that appeared to be filled with Easter lilies. One of the men was at least six-feet tall with curly brown hair and a polo coat and another was described as short and portly. A fourth man waited outside in an automobile. The House adjourned its regular business for the day at 5:18 p.m. and the men hid behind seats in the gallery while legislators, clerks, and staff filed out of the room below. When the coast was clear, the men reached high over the railing and cut two threads of metal wire that held an historic ornamental fish made of pine wood––better known as the Sacred Cod. The nearly five-foot long replica painted in silver signified the importance of the fishing industry to Massachusetts and had hung in the chamber since 1895. The tradition dated back even longer and earlier versions of the wooden codfish were on display in the Old State House well before the American Revolution. A committee tasked with reporting on the history of the “sacred emblem” in the late nineteenth century described the symbol in solemn terms:  “Let us take it in reverence and honor, and place it on high as one of the proudest decorations of this great hall; and let it remain there so long as this State House shall stand, a memorial of the Pilgrim, his privations and simplicity; an emblem significant of the hardiness, courage and faith of those who dare and defy the seas, and daily telling of the great and surpassing glories of Massachusetts and her sons.” After cutting it down the thieves carefully stowed the wooden fish in the long flower box. Bits of greenery fell out in the process and were later discovered on the House gallery floor along with a torn envelope. Once the Sacred Cod was hidden away, the men surreptitiously exited through the adjoining press gallery and made their way back downstairs. The thieves had scoped out the building the day before and studied the routines of the court officers and doorkeepers to facilitate their getaway. It was about six o’clock in the evening and the sun was just setting on Beacon Hill when they furtively exited the building via a side entrance by Ashburton Street. The theft was discovered by a watchful guard later that evening around eight o’clock and the State Police were quickly notified, along with the sergeant-at-arms and building superintendent. Police detectives inspected the gallery and scrutinized the walls and railings for fingerprints. A systematic search of the entire building was also conducted. Few leads were found. The theft of the Sacred Cod quickly captured the public’s attention and sparked numerous offers to help. Officials in Barnstable County held an emergency meeting and wired a message to the governor offering to loan their own sacred Cape Cod codfish to the Legislature until the Commonwealth’s “immortal and sacred” codfish was recovered. Plenty of anonymous tips, fishy rumors, and red herrings also flooded in. One lead took police north of Boston to the city of Lynn, where a Boston University student was mistakenly suspected of involvement. Another tipster claimed that the fish was being spirited away to New York by airplane, which led to one unlucky college student being deplaned, questioned, and searched by police until it was discovered he was the victim of a practical joke.  Police also conducted a search along the banks of the Charles River, mistakenly believing that the thieves might have intended to return the cod to its natural habitat. Another fishy report claimed that the Sacred Cod could be found in a five-foot box in the basement of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When a search was conducted a box was indeed found but it contained only an unfortunate minnow. Some leads did pan out. Police were able to track down a florist in Cambridge who remembered selling a large flower box to a young man matching eyewitness accounts. The lead also matched up with the evidence of laurel sprigs discovered in the gallery. The trail of suspicion quickly led back to Harvard Square. It was well known that students at The Harvard Crimson and the rival Harvard Lampoon often committed elaborate pranks. Accusations quickly flew between the two feuding student publications, accompanied by threats of expulsion from the college administration. At one point the Crimson claimed to have evidence of the Lampooner’s liability and threatened to expose those involved if the fish was not promptly returned. Thomas Bligh, the lead police detective on the case, shared the belief that Harvard students were to blame for confiscating the cod. “It’s probably the Lampoon boys,” he told the Boston press. “They think it’s a prank. But it’s not. It’s serious.” Two days after the theft, with pressure and accusations growing, a mysterious phone call was placed to Harvard Yard Police Captain Charles Apted around ten o’clock in the evening. “I was asked if I was interested in the Sacred Cod,” he recounted. “I said I was.” Apted was given instructions on where to meet and that evening he drove to the rendezvous near the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. On arrival he spotted a car, described as a “roadster,” with two men inside and no rear license plate. He approached, but the vehicle sped away along the darkened road.  Apted drove in pursuit for about twenty-five minutes until the roadster finally stopped on a side road. One of the men exited wearing a mask and unceremoniously handed over the five-foot cod. Before Apted could commit any details of the encounter to his memory, the man had returned to his car and sped away. With the fish recovered, Apted immediately notified Detective Bligh and drove to his office later that evening to deliver the prized possession. By the following morning the Sacred Cod was back at the State House under the watchful care of the building superintendent. A few touch ups were necessary to fix three damaged fins but otherwise the cod was returned in good condition. Later that morning the sacred symbol was restored to its rightful location in the House chamber, except this time it was hung a foot higher so as to prevent any future “codnapping” attempts. Though Harvard Lampoon student editors were widely blamed for the theft, State Police decided not to press forward with any charges once the fish was safely returned. The Sacred Cod story drew national attention and was featured on the front page of Boston newspapers for three straight days. While ample prose was devoted to the case, the cod caper was also conveyed in poetry, including by one unidentified author: Appeal for return of a Sacred Cod “O shameless man,O cruel thief! Return our cod, And ease our grief! Oh, MassachusettsThere she stands So pleadingly With outstretched hands. O, steal the Lowells, If you wish, But spare, O, spare Our sacred fish. Steal all the Cabots, If you must, But spare our cods – In cods we trust!” Josh Cutler, a former Democratic state representative from Duxbury, is the author of Under the Golden Dome: Historic Talks and Tales from the Massachusetts State House.The post The case of the State House cod caper  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/055.jpg?fit=1024%2C800&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Free.,National Dems to deliver more than $1M a month to state parties,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-dems-deliver-more-1m-month-state-parties,,"The Democratic National Committee will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years in an effort to build state-level infrastructure and operations, the DNC announced Thursday.The agreement marks the DNC’s largest total investment in Democratic state parties to date and comes as Democrats try to rebound from significant losses in the 2024 election cycle.Each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month, a $5,000 increase from the current baseline, the DNC said in materials provided to States Newsroom ahead of the wider announcement.Republican-controlled states will get an additional $5,000 a month, bringing their monthly total to $22,500. The GOP-controlled states will get that additional investment through the DNC’s Red State Fund.The DNC’s definition for a GOP-controlled state is one that meets at least two of the three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; a quarter or less of their congressional delegation is made up of Democrats; and Republicans hold supermajorities in both state legislative chambers.As part of the agreement, the DNC said it will host six regional training “bootcamps” for state parties per two-year cycle and will also hire new staff to the Association of State Democratic Committees.The DNC said the initiative also aims to help Democratic state parties with their infrastructure, staffing, data and tech operations as well as with organizing programs and preparation for future election cycles.DNC Chair Ken Martin, the former Minnesota party chair who was elected to lead the national party in February, called the initiative “a historic political investment unlike anything Democrats have done in modern times” and said in a statement it is part of a long-term strategy.“We’re putting our money where our mouth is to equip state parties with what they need to reach working families who deserve better, build long-term success all across the ballot, and gain electoral ground for years to come,” Martin said in the statement.“Elections are won in states — and that’s exactly where we will be investing our resources,” said Martin.Last week, Martin laid out the leadership board’s organizing principles, which centered on “organizing early, organizing always, organizing everywhere, and winning everywhere.”“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment and organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything we’ve done before,” Martin wrote in that memo.In a Thursday statement, Jane Kleeb, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, said “state parties are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and through this investment, our state parties will receive the support they need to show voters that, no matter where they live, there is a strong Democratic Party in their corner, protecting their rights and economic opportunity against Republican attacks.”The strategy bears some resemblance to the 50-state strategy pioneered by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009. Dean was scheduled to appear on a DNC press call Thursday.Critics during Dean’s tenure argued that spending in deep-red areas pulled resources away from winnable races in more moderate states and congressional districts.",,,,2025-04-24 10:09:44.700168

In the 38-page filing, attorneys general for Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota[...]","President Donald Trump speaking at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, on Feb. 22, 2025. (Photo by Gage Skidmore | Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0)A dozen Democratic attorneys general, led by the AGs in Arizona and Oregon, filed a lawsuit Wednesday arguing that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs were illegally implemented and will cause irreparable harm to their constituents.
In the 38-page filing, attorneys general for Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont urged the U.S. Court of International Trade to find that the president’s tariffs were issued illegally.
In the past three months, Trump has at various times declared and withdrawn the financial penalties on multiple countries. For now, the White House has settled on a 145% tariff on most products imported from China, 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% base tariffs on the rest of the world.
Another 57 countries were subject to “reciprocal” tariffs that were actually based on trade deficits, not existing tariffs that those countries had applied to American goods.
The attorneys general argued that the whiplash of constantly changing tariff rates has injected uncertainty into the country’s economy and said the president’s misuse of his strictly defined powers violates the U.S. Constitution.
“These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the President’s whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority,” reads the lawsuit. “By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy.”
Arizona AG Kris Mayes, who has mobilized her office to challenge the federal government’s actions in thirteen different lawsuits, called the tariffs “economically reckless” in a news conference announcing the latest lawsuit.
“As Arizona’s chief law enforcement officer, I will not stand by while the federal government imposes policies that harm our economy, violates the constitution and ignores the limits of executive power,” she said. “This lawsuit is about protecting Arizonans and businesses large and small, it is about defending our constitutional system and reminding this administration, yet again, that no one — not even the president of the United States — is above the law.”
The attorneys general argue that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs, and that Trump’s bid to circumvent that by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is unlawful. The act, they wrote, makes no mention of tariffs, and only empowers the president to regulate, investigate or block trade while an investigation is ongoing.
Mills warns that Mainers will foot the bill for Trump’s tariffs on Canada

And, they argue, the requirements for Trump to act during peacetime haven’t been met. The act grants the president the ability to regulate trade between the United States and other countries if there is an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that poses a risk to national security, foreign policy or the country’s economy.
To satisfy that, Trump has justified his tariffs by accusing Canada and Mexico of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl and China of failing to intercept the chemical precursors that are used to manufacture fentanyl. And while Trump relied on IEEPA to greenlight 10% tariffs against the rest of the world, he provided no reasoning that might comply with the act’s requirements.
The lawsuit also notes that applying tariffs to every product from Canada, Mexico and China violates IEEPA, because not every product that is imported from those countries is related to the president’s purported goal of addressing the fentanyl crisis.
“The Plaintiff states agree that the fentanyl crisis requires urgent government action, but the imposition of tariffs is neither an effective nor a lawful response to that crisis,” the AGs wrote in the lawsuit. “The (tariff orders for China, Mexico and Canada) lacks any rationale for the tariff rates imposed and bears no relationship between the goods subject to the Order and the claimed emergency.”
Maine farmers, brewers concerned about next round of tariffs

Maine leaders have warned that tariffs on neighboring Canada, in particular, could have a drastic impact on the state’s economy. Last year, the two traded more than $6 billion in goods. This includes about $1.5 billion in exports of many products from the state’s heritage industries including blueberries, lobsters and forest products, according to a fact sheet from the Canadian government.
“From home heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products, to Maine’s paper mills, forest products businesses, agricultural producers, and lobstermen, the tariffs on Canada would be detrimental to many Maine families and our local economies,” U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said in remarks in support of a resolution by Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that would undo Trump’s emergency declaration targeting illicit fentanyl coming over the northern border.
It’s also unclear how the Canadian tariffs could impact energy prices.
ISO New England, which coordinates the flow of power for  Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island said 9% of New England’s electric demand was met with imports from Canada and New York. More than 5% of total demand is served by imports from Canada. Certain rural areas in Northern Maine that are directly linked to electric grids in Canada and have no viable alternative supply could be hardest hit.
Maine’s agriculture sector is also deeply interconnected with the state’s northern neighbor.
“I think our farmers are going to navigate how long can they hold off on passing through any of these increased prices to consumers, if possible,” said Sarah Alexander, executive director of Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, during a press call earlier this month. But “ultimately that means it’s going to come out of the profitability of the farm.”
This isn’t the first lawsuit the White House has had to contend with in the wake of its tariff policies. Last week, California launched its own legal challenge in federal court that similarly attacked the president’s use of his emergency powers to impose tariffs. And a Florida woman who owns a stationary business went to court to contest the fact that her voice, and those of other U.S. citizens, was ignored because the tariffs weren’t subject to congressional debate.
A group of small businesses also filed a lawsuit against Trump’s use of the IEEPA in the U.S. Court of International Trade on April 14. On Wednesday, a panel of judges overseeing the case decided against freezing the tariffs while litigation continues. A hearing is scheduled on May 13 for the court to consider the issue.

Where in the world is that language?


By: Leslie Bonilla Muñiz - Thursday April 24, 2025 9:03 am












As the legislative session enters its final hours, tweaks and overhauls alike are coming rapid-fire.
Indiana’s retired public employees are likely to nab pension bonuses intended to boost benefits that don’t otherwise keep up with inflation — but with a 5% cut — under a final draft for House Bill 1221. That’s after a finance-focused Senate committee cut the 13th check and 1% cost-of-living-adjustment entirely. House lawmakers, however, sought years of bonuses.
Elsewhere, several contentious provisions were dropped from less-controversial underlying legislation. But some authors are hoping to re-home them.
It appears a ban on sleeping or sheltering on public property has been removed from Senate Bill 197, prompting rumors it would be inserted into legislation dealing with juvenile justice. But the final version of that bill is still outstanding.
Another prohibition, this one on government-supported “obscene performances,” wasn’t in a conference committee report filed on Senate Bill 326. But that report was quickly withdrawn and is still in flux.
Asked where the language might go, Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, told the Capital Chronicle, “I don’t know any better than anyone else.”
And detailed language cracking down on illicit massage parlors was cut from the negotiated draft of House Bill 1416, which would require human trafficking awareness posters in gas stations and rest stops. Rep. Wendy McNamara, R-Evansville, repeatedly called it too “prescriptive.”
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, authored the language after law enforcement raided parlors in his district. He told the Capital Chronicle that he aims to find a new place for a recast version that offers local governments greater decision-making powers.

Not long afterward, Palmer’s local visitor center dedicated a statue to the cabbage and the other colossal world-record vegetables grown in the area.
Now, at the urging of a leading visitor center volunteer, a state legislator from Palmer is proposing to enshrine Alaska’s giant cabbages in state law as the official state vegetable.
If adopted by the House, Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, House Bill 202 would declare that “Giant cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is the official vegetable of the state.”

	Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, introduced the bill, but it picked up bipartisan support almost immediately with the co-sponsorship of Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage.
This is the third time Johnson has suggested honoring the giant cabbage. In 2020 and 2022, she introduced bills that would have declared it the state vegetable. Neither bill received a hearing despite bipartisan support.
It might be viewed as silly, but Johnson said that the bill serves a legitimate tourism and economic development purpose.
“Just like you have a state salmon, it’s a fun fact and a way to point out something unique about Alaska,” she said. “People throughout the world do not ever think about the fact that we have this amazing place to grow vegetables.”
At the Palmer Visitor Center and Museum, Richard Estelle frequently fields vegetable-related questions from tourists.
He suggested the bill to Johnson, who introduced it at his request. 
The son of a vegetable farmer, Estelle said he was looking up various state symbols and “got a little incensed” when he realized that Alaska doesn’t have a state vegetable.
“New Mexico has got two of them. They’ve got red chili and a green chili. And Idaho has the potato,” he said.
Those vegetables are symbols of the state’s agriculture industry, he said. Alaska recognizes mining with a state mineral, and fishing with a state fish. Why not agriculture?
“I thought agriculture in Alaska ought to get something. It’s an important industry, and so we probably ought to have a state vegetable,” he said.
After considering carrots and other options, he settled on the world-record cabbage.
While the Alaska State Fair has plenty of big vegetables, the cabbage takes center stage, Johnson said.
“The cabbage was the first one that became the big icon. And it’s the iconic vegetable at the Alaska State Fair,” she said.
“There’s never been any other place in the country that’s ever surpassed (the world record), and we will hold the record forever,” Johnson said. “Now, there is someone in Wales currently that is trying to beat us, and they can’t do it, but I’m keeping my eye on them.”

As California moves to sue President Donald Trump’s administration over tariffs, Californians working in the state’s wine, agricultural and port industries must navigate a murky economic outlook that could upend their livelihoods, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Igor Ivanov owns the Vinous Reverie wine shop in Walnut Creek. Because it sells mostly wines from Europe — where Trump has threatened 200% tariffs — Ivanov said he may need to make some changes, including stocking up on California wines or closing his shop altogether.

Ivanov: “I’d have to think about whether it’s worthwhile staying in business.”

At stake: The U.S. wine industry makes about $86 billion in annual sales, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, and California exported $1.3 billion worth of wine in 2022.
But tariffs don’t just affect wine sellers. Winemakers could face higher costs on bottles, since glass is mostly imported from China, as well as labels, corks, wooden stakes for vines and more. 
California is also a major exporter of wine, making up 95% of the country’s U.S. exports, said a spokesperson for the Wine Institute. More than a third of the exports go to Canada — a country in which some of its political leaders have publicly criticized Trump’s tariffs and warned against traveling to the U.S. 
U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat whose district includes Napa’s Wine Country, said some of his constituents have reported that their Canadian business partners have canceled hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of orders. Potential sales to Mexico or the European Union are also on hold. One winery in St. Helena told Thompson’s staff that due to tariffs Trump imposed during his first term, it lost 90% of its business with China.
But Natalie Collins, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, said there could be one benefit: Tariffs on competing wines, including those from Europe, could help local California wineries.
That includes Bruce Lundquist, co-founder of the California sparkling wine producer Rack & Riddle, who agreed with Collins.

Lundquist: “I wish Americans would look at wines grown in their backyard.”

An inside look at mental health court

“I really didn’t know what to expect.”
That’s how Judge Ronald Owen Kaye described his reaction to CalMatters’ Joe Garcia after Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him to the Los Angeles Superior Court in 2020.
Kaye presides over a mental health court, a key component of the state’s effort to implement diversion services amid a growing number of criminal defendants struggling with mental health issues. These courts receive alleged offenders who are incompetent, or at risk of being found incompetent, to stand trial. Through partnerships with county health services, the courts can also help connect individuals with treatment and housing.
Before becoming a judge, Kaye was a former legal aid attorney, a federal public defender and a civil rights attorney. He’s had a history of filing multiple lawsuits against the county related to failures for providing proper mental health care.
Kaye frequently interacts with defendants dealing with chronic homelessness, mental illness and substance abuse, and says he aims to “make people feel comfortable in court and make them feel like they matter.”

Kaye: “I’m always balancing these issues of liberty — people’s freedom; and treatment — getting them quality of care; and making sure the community is safe. That’s essentially what I do in virtually every aspect of my job.”

CA Dems split on housing

At the beginning of the legislative session, Democratic legislative leaders said they intended to push colleagues to focus on the state’s cost-of-living issues. But the narrow passing of a pro-housing bill, during a tense Senate committee hearing Tuesday, underscores a rift among Democrats who want to quickly build housing and other infrastructure projects, and progressives concerned with affordability and labor agreements.
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, Senate Bill 79 would require cities to allow taller and denser housing construction near public transit stations. Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Housing Committee, opposed the bill saying that the measure didn’t guarantee that projects would be built with union labor, nor require new units to be affordable for low-income residents.

Wahab, in an interview with CalMatters: “Because there is such a need right now, developers are seizing the moment and experimenting with options that are truly a sweetheart deal for them.”

Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the author of the bill and a vocal advocate for housing production, pushed back against Wahab, arguing that she only provided blanket opposition to the bill instead of offering possible amendments.

Wiener, at Tuesday’s hearing: “There’s apparently not a single thing in the bill you like.”

(Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)Tears welled in Michelle Flynn’s eyes as she told a crowd of onlookers how for years Utah’s only family homeless shelter in Midvale has operated at max capacity — at times having to turn parents and their kids away.
“Our team members know better than anyone what it means to tell a family with children that we don’t have any room for them,” said Flyyn, executive director of The Road Home, one of the state’s largest homeless shelter operators. 
Until recently, the 300-bed Connie Crosby Family Resource Center in Midvale has been the only emergency shelter in the state exclusively for families with children. The dorm-style facility has been overrun — unable to keep up with the growing number of Utah families experiencing homelessness. Since 2022, upwards of 75 families at a time in the Salt Lake area have been on waiting lists to get into emergency shelter, resorting to living with relatives, friends, or in cars or tents, according to The Road Home.
But soon, there will be another place for struggling families to go. 
Unveiling FINCH

On Wednesday, Flynn and other state and local leaders celebrated the ribbon cutting for the Family Interim Non-Congregate Housing Facility, or FINCH for short. 
The new facility — expected to begin housing families in early May — marks the state’s first ever emergency shelter offering private rooms for families. Previously, the property at 315 W. 3300 South in South Salt Lake functioned as a Motel 6. Now, it will house up to 85 families, and has a maximum capacity of up to 400 people — though on average, depending on family sizes, it’s expected to house an average of 72 families and 340 people. 
“I want to make sure that everyone knows that the FINCH is not just a facility. It’s a reflection of our community values and ensuring that children and families are not on the street,” said Laurie Hopkins, executive director of Shelter the Homeless, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing homelessness in Utah and the owner of the property. 
In 2023, the number of Utahns in families experiencing homelessness increased by a striking 27% in three years— up from 5,520 individuals in 2020 to 7,033. That included 3,748 children, according to a 2024 report by the Utah Office of Homeless Services. 
Emily Wegener, general counsel for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and a member of The Road Home’s board, said that during her time volunteering at the Midvale family shelter, she’s seen “firsthand some of the challenges that congregate shelter” poses for families. 
Family homelessness is a growing problem in Utah. What should be done?

“Some families are able to face that challenge of congregate shelter better than others,” she said. “In some cases, it causes families to bounce back and forth out of shelter to friends’ couches, other shelters, and creates even more instability for children.” 
So Wegener said she’s “thrilled” to see FINCH open to fill an unmet need for Utahns and their kids experiencing homelessness. 
Each family staying at FINCH will have their own private room with beds, a bathroom, a mini microwave and a fridge. The main building also offers common areas, including a dining room — providing three meals a day — a play room, laundry room, and an outdoor area for pets. It also offers on-site case workers to help connect families with resources including schools, jobs, health care, and other needs while providers work to find them a solution for permanent housing.
Wegener said FINCH is needed now more than ever, not just because the Midvale shelter is full, but because Utah’s high housing prices continue to squeeze families.
“It’s really difficult to afford a place to live in Utah,” she said, adding that a two-bedroom apartment averages $1,390 a month. “For one person making minimum wage of $7.25, that is the same as 148 hours a week, or 3.7 full-time jobs. So even for two parents, it’s pretty much impossible to have a two-bedroom apartment if you’re paying market rate.” 
Families, according to The Road Home, will be admitted to the facility on a referral basis through Salt Lake County’s coordinated entry process, which is managed by the Salt Lake Valley Coalition to End Homelessness.

How Utah’s newest family shelter came to be
It’s been a long road for FINCH, taking years of financial and political wrangling to become a reality.
Shelter the Homeless purchased the former motel all the way back in April 2023 for $14 million, which included $10 million from the state, plus another $1 million in state funding for remodeling, according to Hopkins. She said another $1 million from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, plus other private donors and money from Salt Lake County, made up the rest 
Last December, the South Salt Lake City Council voted to approve FINCH’s zoning, one of the last hurdles for the shelter to open. It wasn’t until earlier this year that the Utah Legislature set aside $3.9 million in ongoing funding to pay for its operations. That’s still short of the $5.8 million needed to fully fund it year to year, but Hopkins said Shelter the Homeless will be looking to fill that gap with other public funds and private donations, which she said she’s confident will come through. 
“The philanthropic community, I think, will step forward and has indicated they’re interested in supporting us. I think Salt Lake County is another possible avenue for us,” Hopkins told Utah News Dispatch, though she added that she’s grateful for the money the Utah Legislature appropriated.

“Really, there’s been so much government funding that came into this project to get it up and running, and that was really important,” Hopkins said. “The state, city, county, they all had to invest in this to help us with getting families off of the street.” 
South Salt Lake Mayor Cherie Wood joined Wednesday’s ribbon cutting ceremony for the FINCH. As did billionaire Gail Miller, owner of Larry H. Miller Company and Utah’s wealthiest person. She serves on Shelter the Homeless’ board, along with Josh Romney, CEO of The Romney Group, a development company. 
Romney, who shared remarks during Wednesday’s celebration, said “two women in particular were instrumental” in making the FINCH a reality. He pointed to Wood — for being willing for her city to host another homeless shelter — and Hopkins, for urging state and local leaders to recognize the need for another family shelter. 
“Two years ago, (Hopkins) came to our board and said, ‘We need another family shelter, and we need to find it now,’” said Romney, who is also the son of former Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah. “She worked tirelessly to find the site and work to put the funds together to make this happen.”
Also crediting Wood, Romney said “it’s always a challenge when you have a homeless shelter in your city.” 
“Most cities say no. Mayor Wood is one of the few mayors in this state who says yes, and she makes things happen,” Romney said. 
Wood called the FINCH’s opening “exciting.” 
“This new shelter demonstrates what’s possible when people come to the table with ‘yes’ in their heart, and we figure out hard things,” the mayor said. 
Wayne Niederhauser, state homeless coordinator, also attended the ribbon cutting. He joked that when Gov. Spencer Cox appointed him to the role four years ago, “I thought things would happen faster,” drawing laughs from the crowd. 
He said facilities like FINCH “are very complicated and challenging.” 
“But they’re worth it.”

The Alabama Legislature began its 2025 session on Tuesday. His bill to ban drag performances in schools and libraries may also effect theater production, but he says he is working with an unnamed senator on an amendment to protect theater productions. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would ban drag performances in schools and public libraries. 
But it could also impact theater productions statewide.
HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, defines drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
According to the Alabama Educational Theatre Association (ALEdTA), with fewer boys participating in theater in high school, girls often play boys’ roles to fill the cast. The association said the legislation could impact school theater productions.
“We all know that in the current environment where boys are not participating as much in theatre; this will have a negative impact on educational theatre,” ALEdTA wrote in a Facebook post Monday.
Historically, the opposite was true. In Ancient Greece, women were considered inferior to men and unfit for the stage, so female roles were played by men. The same was true in the Elizabethan era for plays by William Shakespeare. Premature boys often played female roles because of women’s limited social status.
The association is calling on its members to advocate for an amendment to the legislation in the Alabama Senate that would exempt theater productions from the restriction on drag performances. The association provided a letter template on the post for its members to send to their senator.
“This bill without needed amendments will force teachers to provide less performance opportunities for students. It will also heavily reduce the plays and musicals that we can perform in Alabama,” the letter said.
Stadthagen said in an interview Wednesday the legislation was not meant to impact theater and that he is working on an amendment for the Senate to make that explicit.

“It does not pertain to that at all,” he said. “The intent is not to harm theater or anything like that. The intent, of course, is to eliminate drag.”
Huntsville High School this fall planned to stage “Peter and the Starcatcher,” a Tony-award winning play based on the backstory of Peter Pan but switched productions due to the possible implications of the legislation. 
“This change was made thoughtfully and early in the planning process before casting occurred to ensure the production aligns with any legal and logistical considerations that may arise,” Craig Williams, a spokesperson for the school system, wrote in an email Wednesday.
Stadthagen said in an interview Wednesday that he had not heard of any theater productions being cancelled and said that was not necessary.
“They don’t need to be cancelling anything at all,” he said. “They have nothing to worry about, I promise you.” 
The bill awaits consideration from the Senate Education Policy Committee, which did not have its regularly scheduled meeting on Wednesday.

(Photo courtesy of Harry Reid International Airport)WWE is approved to receive $4.2 million in transferable film tax credits for WrestleMania 41 and related events, according to an application approved earlier this month by the Governor’s Office for Economic Development and the Nevada Film Office.
That tax abatement is on top of a $5 million sponsorship from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which was approved back in May 2024.
The $4.2 million in transferable film tax credits represents roughly 12% of the $33.7 million total production budget WWE estimated for two nights of WrestleMania 41 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and three nights of wrestling events at nearby T-Mobile Arena. But $4.2 million is more than half of what the company estimated it would spend on local labor and at local businesses.
WWE estimated it would pay $2.6 million in wages to Nevada residents and $17 million to out-of-state talent. Both amounts, as well as $5.3 million in in-state spending on things like hotels and catering, were considered qualified expenses for determining the amount of film tax credits the company is eligible to receive.
The application, which is considered a public record, illuminates the operations of Nevada’s transferable film tax credit program, which is currently capped at $10 million per year but is being considered for massive expansion through a pair of competing bills. The application was submitted by Event Services LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WWE, and approved by the Nevada Film Office, a division of GOED, at a meeting on April 3.
WrestleMania 41 was held at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Saturday and Sunday. Three other wrestling events were held at T-Mobile Arena on Friday, Saturday, and Monday. All five events were taped for broadcast on television or streaming services, which is why the company is eligible for film tax credits.
The weekend also included myriad related events, including a five-day “interactive fan experience” called WWE World held at the Las Vegas Convention Center, which is operated by the LVCVA.
WrestleMania is not representative of most productions that apply for Nevada’s film tax credits because it is a live event that generates ticket sales, which will directly generate revenue for the state through live entertainment tax and indirectly through tourist hotel rooms and sales tax.
How they got to $4.2m
When applying for transferable film tax credits, companies must disclose their total budget and break down what amounts are being spent on labor and other types of expenditures.
According to the WrestleMania application, which is dated early March, the company estimated a total budget of $33.7 million, including:

$2.4 million for Nevada stagehands,
$2.7 million for non-resident “below-the-line” labor,
$17 million for non-resident “above the line” talent,
$5.3 million in Nevada expenditures,
$8.6 million in non-Nevada expenditures, and
$260,000 for Nevada security workers.

WWE estimated their five taped events would hire 450 Nevadans for 22,100 hours. That works out to an hourly wage rate of $121.71.
As for non-Nevadan labor, they estimated 300 “above the line” people — those are the executives, directors, and top-billed performers like John Cena and Cody Rhodes — earning $17 million and 450 “below the line” people working 10,800 hours for $2.7 million.
The $5.3 million in non-labor in-state spending is further broken down:

$3 million on miscellaneous expenses,
$855,000 in freelancer hotel expenses,
$369,000 in hotels for talent,
$323,921 in equipment rental,
$106,000 for catering, and
$40,137 for props, stunts & gags.

WWE requested that talent expenses and building rents budget items be considered confidential and redacted from their otherwise public application. That is a common request granted by GOED. Cumulative spending amounts listed on the spreadsheet suggest around $62,000 was spent on building rent and related expenses.
TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of WWE, on Tuesday called Wrestlemania 41 “the most-successful and highest-grossing” in the company’s history, though it did not disclose any financial amounts. An estimated 125,000 people attended the two-night main event.
WWE stated in press materials and on its application to GOED that WrestleMania brings “more than $200 million in economic impact for host cities on an annual basis.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5929-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 08:08:28.064797

A mob attacked about 125 protesters, including Dr. Gilbert Mason, with bricks, chains, baseball bats, cue sticks and pipes after they walked onto “whites-only” Biloxi Beach. 
“We called it Bloody Sunday,” Mason recalled. “They were waiting for us with pipes and chains and baseball bats and pool cues.” 
By the time dawn broke, more than 20 Black Mississippians had been injured. 
“Tetanus shots had to be administered, gashes were sewn, and eye and head injuries were tended to. Most of the demonstrators were beaten badly as onlookers, such as the law enforcement, stood watching,” the Mississippi Civil Rights Project wrote. 
Police arrested protesters instead of their attackers. Before the week ended, two Black youths, Malcomb Jackson, a member of Mason’s scout troop, and Bud Strong had become victims of the racist violence. 
Less than a month later, the Justice Department sued the city of Biloxi for barring Black Americans from these nationally funded beaches. In 1963, Mason and others conducted another wade-in to protest the segregated beaches, and dozens of them were attacked. That protest came 11 days after Mason’s close friend, Medgar Evers, was assassinated. Demonstrators placed black flags in the sand to honor the slain civil rights leader. 
Mason told his story in his book, “Beaches, Blood, and Ballots: A Black Doctor’s Civil Rights Struggle.” A U.S. National Science Foundation ocean research vessel is named after Mason to honor his legacy.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee advanced a vaping regulation bill Wednesday after hearing arguments from the sponsor and an opponent representing the vaping industry.
HB 8, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, would amend state law regarding the sale and regulation of tobacco, alternative nicotine products, and electronic nicotine delivery systems, often called vapes. It would restrict sales via vending machines, increase penalties for violations, establish new licensing fees to create a dedicated enforcement fund and require K-12 schools to adopt policies for vaping awareness and prevention.
Drummond described it as a necessary regulation and said that it would bring in about $2.5 million in revenue to the state coffers. There are currently no licensing or permit fees for vaping products.

“I just left the Prevention Day across the street at the Capitol, where there are teachers who brought students up, and the number one issue was vaping, and they were talking about how they don’t know what to do,” Drummond said.

Drummond also said the bill addresses underage violations, saying that when minors are found in violation in public schools or private schools, they will go to juvenile courts instead of adult courts.
Meghan Hardesty, president of the Alabama Vape and Hemp Association, called the bill “dangerous, ineffective and economically devastating” for regulating age-restricted vape shops.
“The vast majority of underage use begins in convenience stores and gas stations, not age-restricted vape shops that already require customers to be 21 and older and verify IDs,” she said.
Hardesty added that the bill harms responsible businesses while benefiting large tobacco companies. She proposed moving vaping to licensed specialty retailers that only allow customers 21 and older, similar to alcohol, if the goal is to curb youth use.
“We are not against smart regulation,” she added. “We want it, but HB 8 is not smart. It is harmful”.  
The bill moves to the full Senate for consideration.

An Alabama House committee Wednesday passed a bill changing the scope of practice for midwives in Alabama after a packed public hearing over the measure.
As originally filed, SB 87, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would have allowed midwives to administer three parts of newborn screenings: heel stick, hearing screening and Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening, which can provide early detection of genetic or metabolic conditions. 
But in the Senate, the bill was amended to only allow midwives to conduct a heel stick and adds language prohibiting midwives from providing “any care” that is not in law or in an emergency to newborns.
“This bill started out with those three newborn screening tests included, but two of them were removed when the substitute was submitted over in the Senate. It passed the Senate, and so that’s where the bill stands today,” said Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont, who is carrying the bill in the House.

Midwives in Alabama were only allowed to practice after the state in 2017 started regulating midwifery and lifted a four-decade ban on the practice. Midwives have since then been fighting to provide more comprehensive care. The medical community has historically pushed back against such efforts, saying midwives don’t have sufficient training, especially in cases of emergency.
State health guidelines in Alabama require newborn screenings within 24-48 hours postpartum. Midwives must refer newborns to pediatricians, often delaying these critical tests. While midwives can administer screenings if a doctor is absent, they are not allowed to order these tests.
Alabama midwives pull support from bill after addition of ‘hostile language’

The new version also states that while a licensed midwife “may order and administer a heel lance within 72 hours after birth,” they are “prohibited from interpreting any tests or screens under this subsection and shall cause any results to be referred to a physician of the mother’s choosing who is licensed to practice medicine.”
“Today, I’m calling out a disgrace … SB 87 has been hijacked. As is, it denigrates the sanctity of motherhood, the safety of newborns, and above all, is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Aaron Crawford, president of the Alabama Birth Coalition, who blamed lobbyists for changes in the bill.
Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, said he opposed the bill as amended but supported its original intent.
“Choices and options are being removed or denied from Alabama mothers because it would seem special interest and a general attitude that our mothers and their midwives can’t possibly make good decisions and should trust the experts. I would humbly submit that 6,000 years plus of evidence would be different to that,” he said.
Maria Cranford, a midwife in north Alabama, said that national standards provide midwives are trained and educated in the care of mothers and newborns through the first six weeks after birth.
“This includes performing newborn exams, administering newborn screens, critical congenital heart screenings with referral… and newborn screenings,” she said. “All of which I’m taught students to do in clinical settings — not here in Alabama, because I’m legally not allowed to.”
Support for the amended bill came from the medical community, who said it would preserve medical standards. 
Linda Lee, executive director of the American Academy of Pediatrics Alabama chapter, read a statement from Dr. Nola Jean Ernest, a pediatrician in Enterprise. Claiming there’s no evidence that midwifery improves infant mortality rates, Ernest said that “all further medical evaluation and care” should be performed by a medical provider.
“Lay midwives attending home births do not have the equivalent training or clinical experience as pediatricians or neonatologists,” Ernest wrote in the letter.
Danne Howard, deputy director of the Alabama Hospital Association, also supported the bill as it passed the Senate and defended notions that “hospitals across the state have not abandoned labor and delivery.” Rural hospitals have faced financial struggle for years, which had led to some delivery units being closed around the state.
“Alabama Hospital [Association] supported the bill as it was passed by the Senate and look forward to additional work in years to come to see what other avenues that we can make great strides in improving access to care,” Howard said.
The committee approved the bill on a voice vote. The legislation moves to the full House.

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)As Democrats spar in one of the most competitive races for governor in decades, one of their chief adversaries on the campaign trail is not on the ballot and holds no elected office.
Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and X, and one of President Donald Trump’s closest advisers, has become the newest target of the six Democrats vying to become our next chief executive. All of them have featured Musk in their campaign ads. One wants the state to stop investing pension funds in Tesla. Another wants to force Musk to get tested for drugs.
Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said it’s a “no-brainer” that Democrats hoping to capitalize on their voters’ disdain of the Trump administration would single out Musk for attacks.
“His vehicles have become symbolic and intertwined with greed and oligarchy and his kind of powerful billionaire status, as opposed to the everyday person and the person who is struggling,” Koning said. “Democrats likely want to take advantage of that.”
Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, supported Democrats through 2020, but in 2022 pivoted to campaigning for the GOP and urged people to vote Republican in that year’s congressional races. He was a key donor for Trump’s last presidential campaign, and the president tapped him to slash federal spending as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency.
But Musk has taken a big hit recently. He poured $20 million into flipping a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race and lost. His favorability has tanked. And sales of Tesla have nosedived. He said this week he would step back from his work in D.C. in May.
Now, New Jersey Democrats are attacking Musk more than they attack their own rivals on the ballot.
“He’s the Democrats’ new boogeyman,” said Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican strategist. “The Democrats are looking to nationalize this election, but really, in the end in November, it’s going to come down to New Jersey issues.”

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop last week called on the state to stop investing pension funds in Tesla, saying on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that he “couldn’t believe that this step hasn’t been taken yet.”
“As Elon Musk threatens Medicaid, Social Security, school funding worth billions to our residents,” Fulop said, “there is zero reason to hold a direct position in Tesla.”
New Jersey held more than 1 million shares of Tesla in a pension fund valued at roughly $425 million in December 2024, which represented 1.72% of the fund’s total portfolio in January.
The campaign website for teachers union chief Sean Spiller has a section called “protect democracy” that warns people must “face the fact that the President and Elon Musk are doing everything and anything to make our lives harder.” In a recent television spot, Spiller referred to Musk as Trump’s “puppet master.”
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney joined the chorus this week, rolling out a new television ad Tuesday branding Trump and Musk as “creeps.”
“When our daughter was born with Down syndrome, we had to fight to get the health care she deserves,” Sweeney says in the ad. “Now, Trump and Musk are threatening everything we care about, and too many Democrats are too weak to stop them.”
A new ad from Newark Mayor Ras Baraka released Wednesday features Musk’s raised-arm salute from the day of Trump’s second inauguration. The narrator of the spot says Baraka is the candidate “to make the wealthy pay their fair share, to stand up to Musk and Trump.”
The two members of Congress seeking the Democratic nomination for governor — Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill — have sponsored federal legislation targeting Musk. Sherrill called for investigations into Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency cuts and introduced a bill that would require Musk — an admitted ketamine user — to pass drug tests to maintain his special government employee status. Gottheimer supported a bill to block Musk’s access to Americans’ private medical and financial data.
The two recently came under fire for accepting donations from Musk’s SpaceX corporate PAC. Sherrill donated $24,000 of those donations to a food bank, her campaign filings show, while Gottheimer told NJ Advance Media he gave the $2,500 he received to other Democrats so they could “beat Republicans.”
“For many Democrats, Musk is symbolic of Trump handing the reins over to this billionaire and all that DOGE has done thus far,” Koning said.
The Musk hatred is not on display in the Republican race for governor, where some of the five candidates have pledged to bring DOGE-style spending cuts to New Jersey. Last month, Bill Spadea, a former radio host, joined a rally in support of Musk near the Tesla dealership in Paramus.
“Lots of proud President Trump supporters there to make it known that we support the America First agenda! When I’m Governor, NJDOGE starts on Day 1,” Spadea said on Instagram.

Wes Moore (center) and the Board of Public Works approved recommendations Wednesday to hold the state's property tax rates on residential, commercial and utility properties at the current rate. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland property owners will not see an increase in the state share of the property tax rate next year, when the rate will hold steady at the same level it’s been since 2007.
The three-member Board of Public Works voted unanimously, and without debate, Wednesday to approve a recommendation to hold taxes on commercial and residential properties at 11.2 cents per $100 in assessed value. The property tax rate on utilities will remain at 28 cents per $100 of assessed value.
Taxpayers are still likely to see their tax bills go up, however, even as the tax rate remains flat. That’s because all 23 counties and Baltimore City reported increased assessments for seven consecutive years.
Still, Gov. Wes Moore (D), who chairs the board, lauded his administration’s efforts Wednesday to hold the line on property taxes for the third straight year.
“I want to highlight that, because when I first introduced this administration’s budget proposal back in January, we made one thing very, very clear … the state of Maryland will not balance this budget on the backs of the working and middle class,” Moore said.
“Everything we were going to do was to make sure that working- and middle-class families were not just protected inside of this moment, but also that we can give just a little bit of extra breathing room for families that were actually receiving a whole lot of additional pressure,” he said.
Moore rejects call for veto as wave of sex abuse cases heads to the courthouse

The recommendation to keep the property tax rates unchanged was made two weeks ago by the Commission on State Debt, which is chaired by Treasurer Dereck Davis, who is also a member of the Board of Public Works.
State property taxes are used to repay general obligation bond borrowing. Currently there is more than $10 billion in outstanding debt. State law calls for the rate to be set at an amount sufficient to repay the annual debt service.
The current rate does not cover that amount. The difference is made up with hundreds of millions in cash from the operating budget.
In fiscal 2026, the state will use $156 million in general funds to backfill the debt service not covered by property tax collections. That amount grows to about $400 million a year later. In fiscal 2030, the general fund will kick in an estimated $500 million for debt service.
The rate-setting vote comes in advance of meetings with three major bond rating agencies in coming weeks, as well as a scheduled June bond sale.
Maryland enjoys a triple-A bond rating, the highest, from all three major rating agencies — Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The high rating means the state pays lower interest on money it borrows.
The state has held that coveted “triple, triple-A” rating for more than three decades. Maryland got its first triple-A rating from Standard & Poor’s in 1961. Moody’s followed 12 years later and Fitch gave Maryland its highest rating in 1993.
Maryland is one of 13 states with the highest rating of all three agencies.
But there are rumblings and concerns about a potential downgrade on the horizon.
A year ago, all three rating agencies reaffirmed the state’s creditworthiness. Moody’s, however, placed the state on a “negative outlook.”
In its report, the agency cited the “difficulties Maryland will face to achieve balanced financial operations in coming years without sacrificing service delivery goals or adding to the weight of the state government’s burden on individual and corporate taxpayers.”
That report was released six months before the election of President Donald Trump and eight months before his administration began making good on his promises to slash federal employment and funds.
Last month, Moody’s released a new report naming Maryland as the most at risk “from changing federal priorities and policies.”
Those back-to-back Moody’s reports and continuing uncertainty at the federal level, as well as how rating agencies will react to potentially billions in looming sex abuse settlements the state could be facing, are stirring concerns about a potential downgrade.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)The federal judge overseeing the case of erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia agreed Wednesday to a week’s delay in discovery that was supposed to get the case moving.
The one-page order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis came without explanation after the government filed sealed documents requesting a one-week extension of the original 6 p.m. Wednesday deadline to file discovery materials in the case.
That expedited discovery schedule had been ordered last week, after Xinis said the government appeared “to have done nothing to aid in Abrego Garcia’s release from custody and return to the United States” where courts would handle his case, as was ordered earlier this month by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Abrego Garcia, a undocumented immigrant living in Beltsville, was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 12 and soon deported to El Salvador, even though ICE now acknowledges that he was still under the protection a 2019 court order that prohibited his return to that country for fear he would be harassed or killed by gangs there.
Abrego Garcia’s family — his wife and children are U.S. citizens — sued for his return and Xinis ordered him brought back by April 7. That deadline passed as her order was appealed to higher courts, but the Supreme court on April 10 largely agreed with Xinis and said the government needed to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S.
But U.S. offiicials, all the way up to President Donald Trump, have said they do not have the power to bring him back from El Salvador. And Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has also said he does not have the power to return Abrego Garcia, who remains in prison in El Salvador.
Wednesday’s pause in the case also came one day after Xinis, in a sternly worded order, charged the government with a “willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.”
That foot-dragging included claims that information could not be produced because it was shielded by government privilege, attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and more that Xinis rejected as unsupported.
“For weeks, defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court’s orders,” Xinis wrote Tuesday.
While agreeing with the government that one discovery question from the plaintiffs was overly broad, Xinis rejected most of the government’s complaints about other interrogatories, or found its answers to them “vague, evasive and incomplete” and an indication of “willful and intentional noncompliance” with the court’s orders and the discovery process.
Despite the Supreme Court’s finding that the deportation was “improper” — “unlawful” in the words of Justice Sonia Sotomayor — Trump, and members of his administration, now insist that the deportation was proper and that Abrego Garcia is a member of the Salvadoran gang MS-13, even though he has never been charged and has no criminal record. If he was returned to the U.S., they say, he would just be tried and deported again.
Supporters of Abrego Garcia, particularly Democrats who have taken up his cause, said that’s all they’re asking for — a chance for Abrego Garcia to have his day in court.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who made headlines by going to El Salvador and forcing a meeting with Abrego Garcia, said on the Sunday talk shows this week that he was not defending Abrego Garcia the man as much as he was “defending the rights of this man to due process.”
That refrain was picked up by Democrats in Maryland this week.
Del. Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who took part in Wednesday in a virtual panel with EMERGE, an organization that pushes Democratic women to run for office, said Maryland has become an example of the Trump administration’s deportation efforts through the Garcia case.
“It is really an example that has spotlighted the danger of this administration, where we are seeing a lack of checks and balances,” Wilkins said, who sponsored successful in the 2025 legislature to protect undocumented immigrants  from unnecessary interactions with immigration officials at specific public locations.
“For the Supreme Court to agree with previous decisions and that this was wrong for a person who a judge has deemed can stay in the country,” she said, “who has been convicted of no crime, neither in the United States, in the state of Maryland and El Salvador … to be kidnapped basically and in cahoots with another country to be impressed is just really beyond the pale.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D), speaking to reporters Wednesday, said authorities here are only being told that Abrego Garcia “is moving around from prison to prison in El Salvador simply because Donald Trump says he is guilty of something.”
“A judge has not said that. A court has not said that. And so what we’re simply saying is bring him home to stand trial and then let a judge decide what exactly should be the fate of him,” Moore said. “Because so this is, this is not about immigration. This is about due process.”
“Are we going to follow the Constitution or not? Are we going to follow the word of the Supreme Court or not, because Donald Trump alone does not have say whether or not a person is guilty or not of a crime,” he said.
Moore said his administration is talking to the state’s congressional delegation and with Attorney General Anthony Brown’s office to look at “all available options” to ensure that due process is followed by by El Salvador, but he did not discuss details.
“I think we have a whole series of options that we are looking at right now ,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2209415187-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:09:44.700168

Dec. 3, 2024. (File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State officials approved a new financing plan Wednesday that will let the health department move thousands of employees out the aging State Center complex in midtown Baltimore, part of a larger effort to move state agencies into more modern facilities.
The Maryland Board of Public works approved an intergovernmental lease that will allow the Maryland Department of Health to move forward on consolidating 3,000 department workers into a new facility at 300 N. Greene Street in Baltimore, a project that had stalled due to financial challenges.
State officials say the move will help revitalization efforts for the West Baltimore area.
“Not only are they [state officials] upgrading and repurposing old facilities, saving taxpayer dollars, but they’re moving into historically underserved neighborhoods,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in a written statement Wednesday.  “The Maryland Department of Health’s plan to relocate to West Baltimore is a prime example.”

The health department is currently spread out between buildings that make up the State Center complex in midtown Baltimore, as well as a few satellite locations throughout the state.
The move, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, will consolidate all health employees at the new Greene Street location, according to a press release from the Department of General Services.
“This location is the former U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) Metro West complex and is part of a 1.1 million square-foot campus, centrally located near metro, light-rail, and commuter bus, and sits blocks from the University of Maryland Baltimore Campus, Lexington Market, and Camden Yards,” the press release says. “This facility opened in 1980 and has been vacant since SSA relocated in 2014.”
The board’s vote Wednesday approves a new financing plan under which the Maryland Economic Development Corp. (MEDCO) will issue bonds to finance renovations and an expanded parking garage, while serving as landlord with the health department as the tenant. The previous landlord, Greene Street Ventures, will now serve as the developer for the move.
The state initially approved an operating lease to move the health department to the new facility in 2022, but market conditions in 2023 delayed the project from moving forward, according to Board of Public Work documents.
“These challenges included rising interest rates, changes in lending requirements, and increased project costs due to inflation,” the document said.
Without the new financing agreement, the relocation project would have stalled due to not having enough funds to move forward, according to state officials.
“This option will save the State as much as $80 million compared to the 2022 operating lease, extrapolated over the financing term,” ccording to Board of Public Works documents. “This will also permit the project to continue to move forward at this location without any undue delays.
“An additional benefit to this project includes the construction of a new onsite garage that will provide MDH [the health department] with 565 additional parking spaces compared to the 2022 lease (1,666 spaces versus 1,101 spaces),” the documents said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter6_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 08:08:28.064797
,Mississippi Today,2025-04-24 11:01:24+00:00,Mississippi Today,Customers of some of the state’s worst water and sewer systems are seeing ‘astronomic’ rate hikes,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/24/customers-of-some-of-the-states-worst-water-and-sewer-systems-are-seeing-astronomic-rate-hikes/,Mississippi small water and sewer system customers are confronting costs of running  adequate systems.,"This is the second half of a two-part story on small water and sewer systems. Read part one here.
A December hearing at the Woolfolk Building in downtown Jacskon started to sound like an auction: Fifty percent. One hundred. Two hundred. Three hundred. State officials watched studiously from their dais as customers recited how much their water and sewer bills ballooned in the last few years.
Judy Johnson’s sewer bill in Raymond went from $16 in 2022, to $40 in 2023, to $52 in 2024, to $67 two months after that. David Huber in Natchez said his combined water and sewer bill grew from $50 to $108 in that same time. 
“This is just for sewer?” Kathy Hardy, also of Raymond, recalled thinking when she saw the rate changes.
The three of them are among 28,000 Mississippi customers of Central States Water Resources, or Great River as its subsidiary in the state is known. In 2021, Central States – which operates in 11 states, mostly in the South – arrived in Mississippi, where it now owns 123 small water and sewer systems.
In Mississippi, which has the lowest median income in the country, many Great River customers are seeing costs skyrocket for basic necessities that were or are still below regulatory standards. But for years, many of them previously paid low rates to providers who were, in turn, neglecting or underinvesting in their infrastructure. 
“It just cascades and everyone keeps kicking the can until a crisis happens,” said Central States founder Josiah Cox. “The butcher’s bill is coming due. These places are falling apart.” 
The result is a chasm between the perceived and actual costs of delivering water and sewer services. 
In 2014, Cox started the St. Louis-based company hoping to fill a niche: buying and restoring struggling small systems that other large utility firms wouldn’t touch. 
“Our thesis was pretty simple,” he said. “There’s small, failing water and wastewater systems all over the country. The giant publicly traded utilities don’t want to mess with them.”
Smaller companies often can’t afford administrative costs, like presenting rate cases in front of the state’s Public Service Commission. Larger companies aren’t interested because it would take years to see a return on their investment. 
While Mississippi officials at the time were happy to welcome a company with Central State’s resources, the state’s ratepayers gave Cox’s team a tepid reception, to put it mildly.

In 2022, as the company started transitioning ratepayers to new rates to fund improvements, the PSC received letters from 800 Mississippians. They described Great River as “greedy,” accusing it of “gouging” them with “unconscionable” rate hikes. 
“We are on a fixed income and finding it difficult just (to) pay our debts and put food on the table and pay for gas and meds,” one letter from a Senatobia customer read. “I pray your office will deny this increase request.”
As it turns out, Central States’ customers had similar complaints in Louisiana, Kentucky and Missouri, and ratepayers in North Carolina and Texas have called out the company over poor water quality and pressure.

Nina McGee, a Great River customer in Panola County, said her water bill used to be just $12 a month, which she admitted was “ridiculous.” 
“I understand an increase,” said McGee, who lives in the town of Pope with less than 300 other people. “I just don’t understand why it’s got to increase that much. It’s tripled in three years.”
In the Wellsgate community, just outside of Oxford, residents sent 132 complaints to the PSC from 2020 to 2021. Most bemoaned poor water quality or water leaks. Great River bought the utility later in 2021 and found that, among other problems, the previous owner hooked up an unpermitted groundwater well – a violation of both state and federal law – that bypassed treatment and created a “blending of treated water and raw groundwater.”

Over the next two years, according to data from the PSC, Great River made about $1.5 million worth of improvements, such as adding new pumps and capacity to the water system. In 2022, PSC filings show, the company proposed raising the average water bill in Wellsgate from $12 to $47, a nearly 300% increase. Dozens of Wellsgate residents wrote the PSC in opposition.
“In no universe does this seem like an acceptable course of action,” one email said.
The company also took control of some of the state’s worst performing small sewer systems, including the ones Mississippi Today recently reported on. Many of those utilities hadn’t raised rates in years. Nearly 30 of the small sewer systems the company purchased, Cox said, never charged a rate at all. Some of those systems depreciated so much that Great River bought them for one dollar each.

At the December meeting in Jackson, Central States engineer Jacob Freeman testified to the PSC about the condition of some of the state’s sewage lagoons, a common form of treatment for small service areas like a subdivision. Freeman described lagoons he saw in the state where so much sludge had accumulated that it “breached the (water’s) surface.”
“At that point, you’ve taken up all the volume in the lagoon, so whatever small amount of treatment that Mother Nature could’ve provided originally is no longer happening, and raw wastewater is short-circuiting the lagoon, going out the back end,” he said, adding that, in similar cases, he’ll find bloodworms or pathogens pouring into the receiving watershed. “That’s dumping into a creek where maybe kids play, or flows down into another body of water that could be recreational. It’s a very, very bad situation.”  
Freeman also testified that even with the high number of sewer facilities in the state violating their effluent limits for different pollutants – about one in three have done so in the last year, a Mississippi Today analysis found – others that seem to be in compliance could be circumventing Mississippi’s relatively lax testing requirements. 
Many states, he explained, mandate quarterly or even monthly testing, versus the “once or twice annually” the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality requires. So a utility that doesn’t meet permit limits, Freeman said, can choose to only be tested during suitable weather conditions when it’s less likely to have a violation. 
MDEQ Executive Director Chris Wells emphasized that an operator could face criminal charges for lying about their test results or misrepresenting compliance. But practically speaking, Wells explained, the agency can’t regulate every system the same way. 
“If you’ve got a system like Jackson’s that’s discharging (millions) of gallons a day into the Pearl River, that’s got much more of a propensity to cause environmental damage than a small lagoon somewhere in rural Mississippi that’s discharging 5,000 gallons a day into a tributary somewhere,” he said. “It’s not that we don’t care about that, we do, it’s just that it’s lower priority from an enforcement or from an inspection standpoint.”

In the roughly four years it’s been in Mississippi, Great River says it’s invested $27 million in system improvements, and has brought 35 sewer systems back into compliance. 
Some customers, like James Windsor in Pass Christian, say while the new rates feel steep, their service has gotten better. Windsor said his water bill went from $18 a month to $51, which he felt would be a fair price if it also included sewer.
“Are we getting our money’s worth? I don’t think so, but it is better,” he said about improvements to water pressure and customer service.
Others say they haven’t seen any difference in what they’re paying for, and also criticize Great River’s pricing model. The company spreads out its repair costs, meaning someone on the Coast’s bill may increase, in part, to pay for repairs in north Mississippi. Doing so, the company said, keeps bills affordable for small customer bases whose systems need millions of dollars in investments. 
“I don’t think that’s quite fair,” said Andy Horyza, who lives in the Turkey Creek subdivision in Olive Branch. “If you’re living in a brand new subdivision and your costs are higher than mine, well guess what? Your costs are higher than mine, you should be covering that.” 
Horyza, who relies on Social Security income, paid around $17 per month for sewer for about 20 years until Great River bought the system in 2021. Over the next three years, Horyza said, his bill jumped nearly 350%. 
The company’s rates vary. For a sewer system using a lagoon, for instance, rates are about $42 per month, versus $59 a month for systems with actual treatment plants. For water, average bills are around $44. 
In a February vote, state regulators at the PSC sided with their angered constituents, voting 2 to 1 to deny Great River’s latest rate hike. The PSC changed hands completely in the 2023 statewide elections. Southern District Commissioner Wayne Carr won his seat with a campaign criticizing Great River. Carr and Northern District Commissioner Chris Brown argue the company hasn’t justified the rates they’re charging. 
“The service hasn’t changed, but the rates went up extensively,” Brown said, estimating that other rural customers on average pay less than $30 a month for water. “So the question is why? You’re supposed to have economies of scale. As public service commissioners, we want to make sure that rate payers are getting what they’re paying for.”
Central District Commissioner De’Keither Stamps disagreed. Stamps, the lone opposing vote, said some people would be “outraged” if they knew about the condition of their water and sewer systems, and that it’s unlikely the necessary funds to fix them will come from somewhere else.

“I choose to operate in reality,” he said. “The campaigning is over. It’s time to govern.” 
Stamps also argued that if Great River appealed the PSC’s decision – which it since did in Harrison County Circuit Court – the company could then add its legal expenses to future rate increases. That case is ongoing. 
Leo Manuel, a Mississippi attorney representing the company, explained the previous trio of commissioners set Great River’s rate schedule, so most customers’ bills were set to increase regardless of the February vote. 
The reality, some experts believe, is that some customers of small utilities around the country are facing a seismic shift in the cost of their basic services, whether it happens now or later. Not only have many of these systems not accounted for the true financial needs of their infrastructure, but they also lack economies of scale. And for many small private systems, which don’t have the same access to government grants as public utilities, raising rates is the only way to make the difference. A 2023 federal report estimated that small water systems in Mississippi alone will need $3.4 billion in investments over the next two decades.

Greg Pierce, who directs the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said without significant public funding – even after historic federal influxes in recent years – water and sewer providers are faced with few other options. 
“I hate to be bleak, but what are the other alternatives?” Pierce asked. “The public entities are not stepping up to assist systems at scale. We haven’t really gotten serious about reforming the system or putting a scale of money into it that would really move the needle on helping small communities. 
“That was true even with the Biden administration, and that’s certainly true now. So I don’t know, it’s a little bit bleak.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/13104314/3X0A2429.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

We are working to transform our state from one that excels at blocking to one that prioritizes building in the right places.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Miro Weinberger: If Vermont wants a future of abundance, we must choose to build.","This commentary is by Miro Weinberger of Burlington. He was the mayor of Burlington from 2012 to 2024. He is currently serving as the executive chair of Let’s Build Homes and as a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Taubman Center for State and Local Government.If you’ve turned on a podcast, watched a late-night show, or scrolled social media in the past month, you’ve probably heard something about “Abundance,” the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. The thesis is simple yet powerful: America, especially in blue states, has over decades created systems that prioritize stopping things rather than building them. We’ve become experts at saying no.“Abundance” has struck a nerve — for good reason. “Abundance” is a call to action, a challenge to break free from what the authors describe as “the politics of blocking.” It’s about a country that’s forgotten how to build: homes, transit, clean energy, the infrastructure of opportunity.Sometimes Vermont can seem insulated and removed from national political conversations — it can be easy to think some of these discussions don’t apply here. We pride ourselves on being a little different, a little apart.But this one? This conversation is 100% about us.When Klein says we’ve built a political system that’s better at stopping things than getting them done — he could be talking about Vermont’s housing shortage. Because we’ve created a system that makes it incredibly hard to build the homes we need. Our state faces a critical housing shortage, yet the pathways to create more homes are gauntlets of redundant state and local rules, costly government mandates and a permit appeals system that enables obstructionists. As a result, the average Vermonter experiences soaring rents, impossible home prices and a growing number of neighbors without secure housing.That’s why we started Let’s Build Homes — to ensure this isn’t Vermont’s future. We are working to transform our state from one that excels at blocking to one that prioritizes building in the right places — and we are already having an impact.In this legislative session, we’ve supported a bill that will make it easier to finance and build the infrastructure — like water, sewer and roads — that makes new housing possible. And thanks in part to our testimony and the coalition members who contacted their legislators, this bill has now passed the Senate. We are also working directly with municipalities to modernize zoning and allow more housing in the places where it’s most needed.Next, by engaging the process launched by the legislature a year ago, we’re taking on one of the biggest barriers: reforming the outdated maps and rules under Act 250 that limit where and how we can grow.This isn’t going to be easy. Already we can see new groups forming that want to continue the politics of blocking. We must push ourselves to grow in a way that respects our cherished natural landscape and is better than the development we have seen in other parts of the country. Vermont’s future depends on finding this balance.But make no mistake, if we are going to end homelessness, be a state where young families can get a start, provide all our kids a good education, enjoy high quality health care throughout the state — if we want a future of abundance, not scarcity — we are going to have to grow.The alternative is a Vermont that becomes increasingly unaffordable, where only the wealthy or those receiving aid can live, where our schools continue to empty, where our rural communities are hollowed out, where our workforce shortage worsens, and where more Vermonters find themselves without homes. That’s not the Vermont any of us want.The politics of abundance requires courage. It means standing up to voices that reflexively say no. It means embracing change while being thoughtful about how we manage it. It means creating new systems for government decisions and action that prioritize results and speed over undue process. Let’s Build Homes is committed to leading this transition — from a state of blocking to a state of building.

(Photo via FWC)Back in the 1990s, when I was on the criminal court beat, I sat through more murder trials than Perry Mason and Ben Matlock combined.
Every case concerned a tragedy, but occasionally there were moments of comedy. One case involved two hitmen who were so inept, they got lost trying to find their target in St. Petersburg. They were so lost, they wound up in Tampa.
There was another murder trial of sorts recently that involved inept killers. In April, it reached its startling conclusion.
Criminal trials are always called “The State v. The Alleged Killer.” Not this one. In this one, the state wasn’t the prosecutor. It was the defendant.
The case didn’t involve just one death, either, but nearly 2,000. The victims did nothing to deserve their fate. They were manatees, and they starved to death because the seagrass they depend on for food was wiped out by the consequences of human pollution.
The case was styled as Bear Warriors United v. Lambert. That’s as in Alexis Lambert, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis recently appointed as secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Prot– well, you can’t really say “Protection,” can you? The agency utterly failed to protect the manatees.
Because of the DEP’s failure, a federal judge ruled on April 11 that the agency had violated the Endangered Species Act. Nobody shouted out “Guilty, guilty, guilty!!” as in a famous “Doonesbury” cartoon, but they sure could have.

“In a state where it’s so hard to ever win anything for the environment in court,” said Katrina Shadix, founder of Bear Warriors United, “this is a big victory.”
The question is: What happens next, in the penalty phase?
“We are going to be compelling the state of Florida to care about the Endangered Species Act,” predicted Jessica Blome, one of the attorneys who represented the Bear Warriors.
 Sewage apocalypse
The scene of the crime for these many manatee murders was the Indian River Lagoon, once considered the most biodiverse estuary in North America.
The lagoon stretches for 156 miles along Florida’s Atlantic coast. It was once blanketed with mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass. In those days, the lagoon boasted more than 600 species of fish and more than 300 kinds of birds, not to mention dolphins and manatees galore.

“The water used to be clear and the seagrass abundant,” said Peter Barile, a marine scientist who grew up near the shores of the Indian River Lagoon. “Now the lagoon is dominated by harmful macroalgae.”
He said one particularly bad species called “Caulerpa” has taken over.
What went wrong? For years, the state and local governments allowed pollution to flow into the lagoon, fueling a series of toxic algae blooms that killed nearly all of the seagrass.
Leaky septic tanks were a major contributor to the blooms, according to Barile. It didn’t have to be that way. In 2010, the Legislature passed a law requiring septic tank owners to get an inspection every five years to make sure they weren’t polluting the state’s waterways.
But septic tank owners rebelled, and two years later legislators repealed the inspections — a move the sponsor of the repeal later conceded was a mistake.
Once the algae blooms wiped out their seagrass, the manatees suffered, especially when the weather turned cold and they sought refuge in the warmth of the lagoon. That’s how hundreds of manatees became malnourished. The starvation situation grew so dire, biologists began tossing lettuce out for the hungry manatees to feed on — an unprecedented step.
Despite multiple warnings about what would happen if the seagrass disappeared, Barile said, “the state let things go on for decades and let builders and the septic tank industry continue dumping waste, and we got a Sewage Apocalypse.”

 Broken promise  
One of the people issuing those warnings over the years was Barile. Among his many attempts to convince decision-makers to do something, he met with a gubernatorial candidate named Ron DeSantis in 2018.
The candidate seemed open to what Barile was saying. He definitely grasped who would gain from reining in the pollution and promised to fix it.

Then, after he was elected, the governor opted NOT to solve the problem.
DeSantis did convene a panel of respected scientists to recommend ways to prevent toxic algae blooms. But when they turned in their recommendations, he ignored nearly all of them.
Instead, he hired an Israeli company to dump a hydrogen peroxide mixture into our waterways to chase the blooms away temporarily.
But the algae keep coming back because he didn’t do anything to stop the pollution that fuels it.
Not even after the manatees started dying.
 No smoking gun
In most of the murder cases I covered, the accused presented what attorneys call the “SODDI defense.” That’s short for “Some Other Dude Did It.”
Similarly, the DEP’s defense in this suit was: Hey, this wasn’t OUR fault.
While the death of so many manatees was “undeniably tragic,” DEP communications director Alexandra Kuchta said in an emailed statement to me this week, “the state of Florida has responded with unprecedented investments to improve water quality and restore habitats, especially in critical ecosystems like the Indian River Lagoon.”
  Jessica Blome via Linkedin
In court, “their argument was, ‘We complied with the Clean Water Act, therefore we are immune from being found to have violated the Endangered Species Act,” Blome told me.
To me, that’s like saying, “I was obeying the speed limit when I ran over that pedestrian, so I can’t possibly be held responsible for the tire marks on his face.” One doesn’t have anything to do with the other.
U.S. District Judge Carlos Mendoza apparently felt the same way.
  U.S. District Judge Carlos Mendoza via U.S. Courts X account
“Compliance with the Clean Water Act … is just one piece of the regulatory puzzle the state must solve,” he wrote in his 21-page order.
Manatees were dying because of the consequences of the pollution the DEP allowed to flow into the lagoon. That’s why, even though its actions may comply with the Clean Water Act, the DEP has repeatedly violated the Endangered Species Act’s protection of that threatened marine mammal, the judge ruled.
Don’t assume the judge was a pushover for environmental groups. Just last year, he rejected a lawsuit filed by the Save the Manatee Club and its allies that attacked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the DEP for setting inadequate standards for water quality.
The Endangered Species Act legal argument was a novel one, Shadix told me, but it proved effective.
The DEP’s attorneys apparently didn’t know how to counter the Bear Warriors complaint. They failed to call as a witness any scientists like Barile to testify, Blome told me. Instead, they called DEP regulators to talk about their water quality rules and enforcement, both of which have proven to be inadequate.
In fact, they conceded that, with the DEP’s current level of cleanup efforts, restoring the lagoon’s seagrass beds would likely take another 12 to 17 years. That’s a loooooong time to put up with dirty water, repeated algae blooms, and manatees going hungry (and dolphins too).
It sounds to me like DEP missed the point of the case. At one point during the hearing, Blome told me, the lead attorney for the DEP stood up waving a letter and dramatically announced that the manatee die-off had officially ended.
The judge didn’t think much of that move.
“Defendant believed this letter was a proverbial smoking gun establishing that manatee takings were no longer occurring,” he wrote. “But even assuming the [die-off] has ended, that would not move the needle in FDEP’s favor.”
That’s because the conditions that caused the die-off haven’t changed much. There was a previous manatee die-off in 2013, and there could be another one this year or next or some other time before full seagrass restoration.
“Is there an ongoing risk of manatee takings in the northern Indian River Lagoon?” the judge wrote. “The answer is clearly yes.”
Meanwhile, the lack of seagrass beds has affected everything from the manatees’ reproduction rate to their feeding behavior — another violation of the Endangered Species Act, which forbids humans from altering either one.
As for the DEP’s bragging about its recent efforts to clean up the lagoon at last, the judge noted that those efforts were “perhaps not so much admirable as legally required.”
 An appropriate penalty
I’d like to point out that Florida had a hand in creating the law that the DEP violated.
  Nathaniel Reed in 1969, via Florida State Archives
A major co-author of the Endangered Species Act was a Florida man named Nathaniel Reed — a Republican, I might add. Reed was a birder and a butterfly collector, and he loved fishing so much his mother joked he emerged from the womb with a fly rod in his hands.
The first endangered species list included quite a few Florida animals, including not just the manatee but also the panther, Key deer, and alligator.
The alligators have bounced back so strongly that they’re now in every single body of water larger than a mud puddle. That proves that listing a species as endangered doesn’t have to be the final word on their future. With hard work and planning, some species can be restored.
But this case marks the second Endangered Species Act case in the last two years that showed Florida officials under DeSantis haven’t been taking the law seriously.
Last year, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the DEP was doing an end-run around the act to speed up issuing permits for developers to wipe out wetlands.
The judge ordered the DEP to stop issuing those permits, in effect halting a lot of wetlands-destroying development all over the state. That includes a pair of new “towns” in Lee and Collier Counties expected to generate so much traffic they’re likely to kill off our recovering panther population.
In that case, the DEP’s defense was to say, basically, that they broke the law because protecting endangered critters is reeeeeeally haaaaaaard. Imagine a teenager complaining about homework and you’ve got the right tone.
“’It’s hard’ is NOT a reason to not comply with federal law,” an Earthjustice attorney told me after the judge’s ruling, enunciating what I think is one of the bedrock principles of the law.
The DEP is appealing that case, and my guess is that it will wind up appealing this decision as well. Our state officials would rather keep arguing than admit that they disregarded the death of an iconic Florida animal in favor of helping big-money campaign donors keep fouling our waterways.
By the end of this week, Bear Warriors United is scheduled to submit to the judge its proposed punishment for the DEP. Shadix and Blome told me they’re considering asking the agency be required to spell out how it’s going to speed up cleaning the lagoon and regrowing the seagrass.
If I were the judge, I’d make the penalty even tougher. I would require that everyone from DeSantis on down to the lowliest bureaucrat to march down and line up next to the lagoon. Then I would require each and every one of them to issue a public apology for not fixing this problem sooner.
Then, to really bring it home to them, I’d require them to do the apology right at lunchtime, and tell them they weren’t allowed to eat anything for the next six hours.
I don’t want this punishment to seem cruel and unusual, but I think making them feel a little of the desperation of the dying manatees would go a long way toward doing justice.

Matt Lehman, R-Berne, sits with his grandson on his lap before session April 23, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Among the bills sent to Gov. Mike Braun Wednesday was a Senate Republican priority measure to increase transparency — and scrutiny — around state government contracts.
Sen. Scott Baldwin’s Senate Enrolled Act 5 advanced for a final time from both the House and Senate with almost unanimous bipartisan support. Across both chambers, only Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, was opposed.
Included in the final draft of the bill are new rules for contacts awarded by state agencies and offices — including a ban on non-public, no-bid deals — and steeper expectations for vendors paid with taxpayer dollars. It also mandates “unfilled” government positions be eliminated, and requires state offices to more closely monitor and publicly report on spending, as well as in-flow and out-flow of federal funds.
Last-minute conference committee negotiations carved out exemptions for agreements between the Indiana Department of Correction (DOC) and private employers. Baldwin noted that some 1,300 offenders are currently employed through 13 DOC “joint ventures” with companies like Cummins, Goodwill, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indiana Pacers.
“These are very difficult to bid out. They’re very specialized, and so we’ve excluded them for that sole purpose,” the senator said Wednesday morning. All other reporting requirements will still apply, though.
Another exception was made for child support contracting between Indiana’s Department of Child Services and local prosecutors.
 Health care bills move to governor

Certain health care entities will additionally be required to report ownership information to the state as part of a transparency effort to detangle potential conflicts of interest under House Enrolled Act 1666. 
It passed the House on a 78-13 vote, with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. The proposal had an easier journey in the Senate, where it had unanimous support. 
Providers like hospitals, insurers, third party administrators and pharmacy benefit managers will need to detail ownership stakes to either the Indiana Department of Health or the Indiana Department of Insurance, depending on their services.
The Secretary of State’s Office will also be involved in collecting and reporting data.

Senators urged their House counterparts to exclude owners with less than a 5% interest in the entity at the behest of small-time providers seeking anonymity — particularly dentists, who are no longer impacted by the bill. That language survived conference committee edits.
But House authors disagreed with the Senate’s additional confidentiality provisions, though bill does give overseeing agencies some discretion when it comes to public reporting. 
“The Senate added so much confidentiality that it was no longer a transparency bill,” author Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, concluded. 
The proposal, along with Senate Enrolled Act 118, both head to the governor, who previously signaled his support for such transparency measures. 
The latter moved with minimal opposition and would compel certain hospitals and health care providers to provide detailed reporting on their participation in the 340B drug program, which pairs drug manufacturer discounts with hospitals caring for underserved populations. 
Some critics say large health systems unfairly profit, prompting additional scrutiny from the state. The initial bill was amended to exclude certain Health Resources and Services Administration grantees.
“When it came back from the House, there was a concern that it may have excluded some hospitals that we wanted to report,” said author Sen. Ed Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso. “The conference committee report simply clarifies that.”
The Senate approved the measure unanimously but it had two opposing votes in the House.
 Casino, teacher pay bills also cross the finish line

Legislation to study relocating a poor-performing casino — or adding a new casino — will soon cross Braun’s desk, too. Senators on Wednesday concurred with House changes in a 37-11 vote.
Senate Enrolled Act 43 would require the Indiana Gaming Commission to contract out for a study to assess the top two regions, revenue-wise, for a casino license.
Author Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, initially sought to relocate a failing casino operating near the Indiana-Kentucky border to the Fort Wayne area. When that effort failed, Zay overhauled an empty vehicle bill to create the study.
‘Destabilizing’ Indiana casino relocation study could also recommend new license

During its trip through the House, the legislation was narrowed from three regions, but expanded by striking relocation-specific language. The study would only take place “subject to available funding,” despite a new November deadline. As he introduced that amendment, Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, noted “the biggest hole in the market is northeast Indiana.” He indicated another possibility is Indianapolis. 
Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-East Chicago, said Wednesday that he’d heard a location has been “earmarked” for Fort Wayne. Zay rejected that.
“Nothing has been earmarked. And that’s why we’re doing the study, to determine where the best locations might be — independent of any influences,” Zay replied.
Randolph also suggested a set-aside for South Bend, but Zay said the city is “already under compact” with the Potawatomi tribe and its Four Winds Casino. Senate Enrolled Act 43‘s text mandates an “impact assessment of a potential tribal casino in the region” and consideration of the “impact of a potential tribal casino on revenues.”
Another measure seeking Braun’s signature, Senate Enrolled Act 146, will raise minimum public teacher pay to $45,000 and bump the minimum percentage of tuition support that schools must spend on teacher pay.
The bill — part of the governor’s priority agenda — passed out of the House a final time in a 90-1 vote, and 47-0 from the Senate. 
The average teacher salary in Indiana during the last school year was recorded at $60,557, according to the latest state teacher compensation report. The lowest teacher salary reported was $40,000 — the current state-mandated minimum. The highest was $110,000. Teacher pay is ultimately set by local school districts.
The original Senate bill, authored by Sen. Linda Rogers, would have additionally provided 20 days of parental leave to teachers who have worked for a school district for at least six months.
That provision was ultimately removed, however, due to budget constraints.
“It was for fiscal reasons, not for policy reasons,” said Rogers, R-Granger. “It’s something I’m sure that we all want to work towards, but it is something that in local school corporations, they can still do today as part of the bargaining process. … I just don’t think this is the right time. There are a lot of reasons to do it. Unfortunately, dollars play into it, and I’m trying to be cognizant of the budgets of local school corporations.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri for MPR News)Minnesota has a shortage of affordable housing, forcing people having to live in encampments and cars and on borrowed couches.
According to the Wilder Foundation, Indigenous people make up 20% of the homeless population — but just 2% of the state’s population. 
I am an enrolled band member with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and I can relate to how my relatives may feel living within encampments. 
I was raised by a single mother, and we struggled to find affordable housing. There were times when we lived in a three-bedroom house with 11 people because we couldn’t find affordable housing. 
This was many years ago, and the cost of living — especially housing — has only gotten worse since then, rising every year. 
Even as the city of Minneapolis claims that encampments have disappeared, the Star Tribune reported recently that “a number of homeless people and those who help them are skeptical that closing encampments is getting people housed. … They say it’s pushing homelessness farther to the margins.”
Given what minimum wage jobs pay and what an apartment costs, we know many people are barely getting by. I know from my own personal experience the stress of living paycheck-to-paycheck. You choose which bills to pay on time, and which bills are more important than others, and hopefully you can pay the electricity bill with the next paycheck before it gets shut off. 
I remember having to live in a home with no electricity because my mother couldn’t afford to pay the bill — she had to choose to pay the rent or the electricity bill. Sometimes we had to light candles just to see in the house at night. This is just one example of the struggles of many low-income families. 
“Minnesota nice” isn’t so nice when you can’t find affordable housing while trying to get by on minimum wage pay. Minnesota needs to provide more low-income housing, so these families and their children can enjoy the luxury of a room to sleep in at night.  
Check out a bill at the Legislature (SF982), which is for the Economic Development and Housing Challenge Program, with a special emphasis on American Indian housing projects. 
The Economic Development and Challenge Program is for affordable rental housing that supports economic development and redevelopment activities and job creation within a community by meeting locally identified housing needs. It serves rental households in areas with incomes at or below the greater of 80% of state or area median income. 
In other words, exactly what we need. 
This bill would help the Indigenous population find housing and help more families live with the luxuries that most of us take for granted: a home.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN240229_070-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 07:01:26.815549

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program, further delaying an effort that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years.
States will have an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access to underserved areas across the country.
The extension comes as the Trump administration prepares to make changes to the BEAD program, according to a notice from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The department is currently reviewing the program “to remove unnecessary rules and mandates, to improve efficiency, take a more technology-neutral approach, cut unnecessary red tape, and streamline deployment,” the notice said.
The $42.45 billion program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, began falling behind schedule in part because of inadequate federal mapping of where broadband is most needed and a lengthy challenge process to the maps. As a result, the slow-moving program has some local officials and experts questioning its efficiency.
They anticipate that federal officials might change an affordability requirement, which mandates states include a low-cost service option for low-income households, or the type of technologies given preference under the program. That shift likely would be away from fiber-optic internet toward satellites or other technology.
Earlier this month, more than 100 state lawmakers from 28 states sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick requesting that any changes to the BEAD program be optional rather than mandatory. They argued that mandatory changes could undo their BEAD plans and delay broadband deployment by a year or more.
The BEAD program originally had required states to submit their final proposals to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within a year of their initial plan’s approval. Citing “extraordinary circumstances,” however — the new federal review — deadlines for states’ final proposals will be moved, according to the notice.
NTIA declined to comment for this story.
All 50 states have had their initial BEAD proposals approved, unlocking a portion — often 20% — of the money the feds will provide. As of April 14, Delaware, Louisiana and Nevada are the only states to have submitted their final proposals for public comment, according to the NTIA’s BEAD Progress Dashboard.
Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas are the only states that have not made any progress beyond having their initial proposal approved, according to the tracker.

But Hall said her overall approach to working with Trump is “one of the smartest things” she has done.
“Whitmer is embracing Trump, she’s complimenting Trump, she’s investing time in building a bridge with Trump,” Hall said. “And I think as a result of that, our state is going to benefit, because we’re going to be in a position we were not in in the first Trump administration, where Whitmer can be an asset to help us get things done with President Trump.”
Whitmer has defended her Oval Office visit, saying she “stayed in the room because I needed to make the case for Michigan, and that’s my job.”
Whitmer wasn’t the only Democrat praised by Hall; he also said he has good working relationships with Lansing Mayor Andy Schor and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is currently running for governor as an independent. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But when he was asked about his approach to working in a bipartisan manner with those leaders, Hall went on a three minute tangent attacking Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) and Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel.
“All Sarah Anthony does is try to wake up and say ‘what can I do for Lansing?’” Hall said. “And I know you guys all like her because of that, but me, I’m the opposite. The problem is, when you get outside of here, there’s not a lot of common sense in Lansing.”
Hall said that Senate Democrats have a “negative governing philosophy.”
“We decided that we were going to actually try to have a positive vision,” Hall said. “Rather than just complain about the other side, like Winnie Brinks and Sarah Anthony and the Democrats in the Senate, we said what if we compared that with actually doing positive governing.”
Hall said one priority he shares with Schor is getting state employees back into the office in Lansing.
He committed to using the budget to get state employees back to Lansing.
“We’re going to do some things to get that going,” Hall said. “I think we’re going to push pretty hard on that to get the state workers back to work in person.”

He is one of four new appointees chosen by Gov. Mike Kehoe (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe’s makeover of the State Board of Education is nearly complete, with the state Senate set to confirm the last of his four new appointments this week.
The turnover on the eight-member board also means its longtime leadership has been pushed aside. That includes Charlie Shields, the former Republican lawmaker who has served on the board since 2012 and was its most recent board president.
Shields told The Independent he was willing to continue serving but supports the governor’s appointments.
“We’re in a good position to move education forward,” he said.
The shakeup has created some friction in the confirmation process, with Ash Grove Republican state Sen. Mike Moon and Florissant Democratic Sen. Angela Mosley asking pointed questions of appointees during their Senate hearings.
That continued on Wednesday, when Moon was the lone “no” vote on the appointment of Thomas Prater, an eye surgeon from Springfield.
 State Board of Education appointee Tom Prater, an eye surgeon from Springfield, listens to questions about his time on Springfield Public Schools’ board during the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing Wednesday morning (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Moon said during the hearing he had received complaints from his district stemming back to Prater’s time serving on the Springfield Public Schools Board of Education.
“There are some people in Springfield who were concerned about things that have happened on the school board after I left,” Prater told The Independent. “So I didn’t have much control over it.”
On the board, Prater helped in the hiring process of former superintendent John Jungmann in 2014 shortly before his departure.
Jungmann faced criticism, as reported by the Springfield News-Leader in 2021, over his diversity and equity training that some labeled “critical race theory.” He was also under fire for his choices on safety measures during the pandemic.
Moon asked Prater how he supported a superintendent who was a proponent of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and what that means today with a governor who has spoken against diversity programs.
Prater said Jungmann was “by far the most experienced and qualified candidate that we interviewed.”
“I don’t remember any kind of DEI discussions coming up in our interviews with him that would have given us the indication, one way or the other, where he stood,” Prater told Moon.
Mosley pushed back on the notion that DEI is harmful.
“You don’t feel that diversity is important,” she said, asking where Prater stood. “All the districts are pretty diverse, so you need to know how to effectively support each area of diversity.”
Prater said he was “right between” Mosley and Moon on the subject, giving an anecdote that he supported the hiring of a Black football coach over a similarly qualified white candidate.
The board is set up to not be dominated by a political party, with law stipulating there can be a maximum of four members of a party. Many appointees, on other state boards as well, take on the “independent” title to conform to this rule.
Prater is joining the board as an independent. His political contributions include donations to Democrats like state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield and St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore. But the majority of his donations benefit Republican candidates, with $21,000 given to Kehoe’s political action committee, American Dream PAC, and numerous donations given to former U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. 
Prater said he has been an independent for “as long as he can remember.”
Shields has repeatedly spoken about board matters with a bipartisan, or nonpartisan, perspective. He told The Independent that the board is intended to be this way.
Appointments are eight-year terms, setting members up to look at issues long-term. These two pieces are “important,” Shields said.
He feels confident that the appointees he knows, Prater and attorney Jon Otto, will take the “same view.”
“I know them to both be really thoughtful, high quality people,” he said. “I think they’ll make great board members.”
Prater was appointed by former Gov. Mike Parson a year ago, serving in an interim capacity while a filibuster blocked full confirmation. He has been sitting in the audience at state board meetings, he said.
Tawni Hunt Ferrarini was appointed at the same time last year by Parson, but Kehoe did not reappoint her to the board and instead chose Brooks Miller for the seat.

Miller, former president and CEO of Jordan Valley Community Health Center in Springfield, takes on the role after recently serving on Truman State University’s board.
He told committee members Wednesday that his experience in community health will help him look for needs inside Missouri’s schools.
“I think that (community health) really kind of goes hand-in-hand with serving children,” he said. “It’s hard to teach a child that has a toothache or other illness.”
Miller is identified as a Republican in his appointment. He donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign and U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison, but also gave $1,000 to Crystal Quade, who lost her bid as the Democratic nominee for governor in November. Quade is from Springfield, which Miller has strong ties to despite currently residing in Sunrise Beach.
Last week, the Senate confirmed the appointment of Otto and Mike Matousek.
Matousek, a Republican from Kansas City, recently served on the Platte County School Board and is the former legislative director for U.S. Rep. Sam Graves.
In his campaign for school board, Matousek opposed mask and vaccine mandates and carried conservative stances on hot-button issues into his time on the board. He was the only member to vote for the district to take up an official bathroom policy that would restrict transgender students’ access to restrooms that fit their gender identity.
Moon complimented Matousek’s willingness to stand alone on an issue.
“You’re not afraid to take those issues on, or at least ask the questions and let them be deliberated,” he said during the hearing.
Matousek has made contributions to several Republican candidates, including state Rep. Josh Hurbert, a Smithville resident who works for Christian private school advocacy and assistance organization Herzog Tomorrow Foundation. Hurlbert also donated to Matousek’s campaign for school board in 2022.
Matousek told The Independent that he was approached about joining the State Board of Education and thought it over before embracing the role.
“Public education is changing in Missouri, and I’d rather be at the table,” he said.
During the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing last week, Mosley asked Matousek questions about his stance on open enrollment and charter schools, asking if he would support funding for public schools or lean on alternatives to neighborhood schools.
 Evergy General Counsel Jon Otto stands with Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, for a picture as part of his appointment to the State Board of Education in a committee hearing April 16 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Matousek is generally supportive of open enrollment, if the state legislature chooses to pass it into law, but is concerned about provisions that would obligate school districts to transport students that enroll outside their home district. But those decisions are up to state lawmakers, he said.
Mosley’s questions were halted after Moon whispered to the legislative aide of the committee chair, who then asked her to reserve the rest of her questions for time outside of the hearing. Matousek was confirmed by the full Senate the next day. 
The Senate also confirmed Otto, who currently serves as general counsel for Evergy.
Otto is a noted advocate of charter schools. He helped found Académie Lafayette Charter Schools in Kansas City and has served on the board of the Missouri Charter Public School Association.
He told The Independent he didn’t have definitive plans for the board, saying he had to “get in and see what is working” first but noted potential for “a lot of new things.”
Otto has made a few contributions solely to Democratic candidates, like a $500 donation to U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids from Kansas.
Gabby Picard, a spokeswoman for Kehoe, said selections were made with the governor’s priorities in mind.
“Gov. Kehoe hopes that the board will continue to address and prioritize increased accountability in school performances and student outcomes, supporting opportunity across geographic and socioeconomic lines and supporting non-traditional school options like charter or virtual schools,” she said in a statement.
Prater and Miller’s appointments must receive final approval in the Senate before they can take office.

The attacks are coming fast and from every direction.
While much of the public’s attention has been rightly focused on efforts by extremist state lawmakers to unravel Amendment 3 and roll back our constitutional right to reproductive freedom, a quieter but equally dangerous assault is underway: a federal effort to dismantle the nation’s only dedicated family planning program, Title X.
And Missouri is one of the first targets.
As the executive director of Missouri Family Health Council, I have a responsibility to sound the alarm. We are Missouri’s sole Title X grantee – the organization trusted for over 40 years to administer family planning funds to health centers across the state. From health departments to FQHCs to hospital clinics to community action agencies and independent family planning centers, these clinics serve tens of thousands of Missourians each year at over fifty-two sites, providing contraception, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other critical health services, often at low- or no-cost.
For many individuals, these health centers are often their only source of care.
Now, that entire system is at risk.
On April 1, Missouri Family Health Council’s federal Title X funding was suddenly and indefinitely frozen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and in the meantime, our network of health centers was left hanging in the balance.
Let me be absolutely clear: if Title X funds are not reinstated immediately, clinics across Missouri will be forced to lay off staff, scale back services or shut down entirely. Tens of thousands of Missourians will be denied life-saving care. This is not theoretical – this is happening now. And this crisis is compounded by the fact that Title X is often the only health care touchpoint for our patients. Six in ten women who access contraceptive care at Title X clinics say it’s their only provider.
But the attacks don’t stop there.
While Missouri’s Title X program is in limbo, Congressional leaders are simultaneously advancing devastating cuts to Medicaid – the country’s largest source of public health insurance. The federal budget proposal would reduce funding to Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, threatening the health coverage of tens of millions of Americans.
Here in Missouri, over 1.3 million people rely on Medicaid — including children, seniors, people with disabilities and low-income families — to access basic health care.
For many Missourians, Medicaid is the only way they can afford health services; slashing Medicaid means rolling back eligibility, cutting critical benefits, and reducing provider reimbursement rates — of which will result in fewer providers accepting Medicaid and fewer patients able to get the care they need. These cuts will disproportionately hurt rural communities, people with low incomes, and those who already face systemic barriers to health care.
Let’s be honest: this isn’t about “fiscal responsibility.” It’s about making it harder for people, especially those historically marginalized, to control their reproductive lives and access essential health care.
Either one of these threats to the sexual and reproductive health care safety-net would severely harm our communities. Together, they are catastrophic.
If both Title X and Medicaid are gutted, Missourians will face impossible barriers to care. People will lose access to affordable contraception. STI rates — already on the rise — will climb even higher. Basic health care will be out of reach for hundreds of thousands of people.
These aren’t just “cuts.” They are deliberate choices to strip people of their agency, their dignity, and their health.
We refuse to stay silent while our safety-net is being dismantled.
We are calling upon Missouri’s Congressional delegation – especially Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt — to stand up for their constituents and restore Missouri’s Title X funding immediately. We call on them to oppose all attempts to slash Medicaid and protect the essential programs that keep Missourians healthy and safe.
This is a moment for action. Lives are on the line. And Missourians are watching.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stethoscope-chart-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 07:01:26.815549

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres|NJ Governor’s Office)The Trump administration has terminated five federal contracts in New Jersey that funded law enforcement work to fight opioid addiction, violence, and hate and bias incidents, cuts that Attorney General Matt Platkin blasted Wednesday as reckless and dangerous.
The Department of Justice notified state officials of the cuts by email Tuesday and ordered the state to pay back all unspent and unobligated balances or face unspecified “enforcement actions.” The contracts, combined, are worth nearly $13.1 million, but Platkin’s office couldn’t immediately say how much remains unspent and must be returned.
Platkin railed against the cuts during a Wednesday media briefing and vowed “to pursue all options,” although he did not specify what that might be.
“There was no warning. We were not consulted on how this would impact ongoing law enforcement efforts in New Jersey. These are current grants in place. We have never seen this before,” Platkin said. “This is not a way to run government. This is not a way to promote public safety.”
The notices said the funding was cut because it “no longer effectuates Department priorities.”
“The Department has changed its priorities with respect to discretionary grant funding to focus on, among other things, more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government,” the notices say.










If they want to cut law enforcement programs that affect my state, I damn well want to be called, at a minimum.


– Attorney General Matt Platkin


Three of the contracts terminated, totaling just over $3 million, supported efforts to prevent and reduce hate and bias incidents in New Jersey. The largest pot of funding, nearly $2 million, was allocated under the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Hate Crimes Program, which helps police and prosecutors do outreach and investigate and prosecute hate crimes motivated by the victim’s race, color, religion, gender, or other protected characteristic.
Also cut was No Hate in the Garden State, an education campaign Platkin’s office launched in September, and the Community Peacemakers Collaborative, a statewide community mediation program that trains people how to respond to bias incidents.
The cuts come as hate and bias incidents have risen in recent years, with 2,706 reported last year and 644 reported for the first three months of this year, state police data shows.
The feds also axed a $4 million grant that supported violence intervention and prevention work and $6 million allocated under the federal Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program, which helps public officials develop diversionary programs to keep drug offenders out of prison and help them recover from addiction.
Such programs are life-saving law enforcement, “not woke liberalism,” Platkin said, adding that they’ve helped drive down violent crime and drug overdoses.
“To say, ‘We’re going to cut programs that protect people from bias, that help people with opioid addiction, that keep guns off our streets’ — it’s irresponsible, it’s reckless, it’s dangerous, and it’s going to get people killed,” Platkin said.
He added: “I hope the attorney general, Elon Musk if he’s involved in this, the president of the United States, starts thinking about the impacts that their decisions that are being made for political purposes have on the ground and affect people’s lives in communities that I am in every single day, that they don’t come to. And if they want to cut law enforcement programs that affect my state, I damn well want to be called, at a minimum.”’

Bradley Knoll was arrested in December 2023 and charged with domestic violence against his wife after an argument escalated over a young relative not getting ready for school.
Knoll eventually pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor in March 2024.
In a complaint against Knoll filed April 22, the JTC said Knoll’s guilty plea violated the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct, which requires that all judges follow the law and “avoid conduct that erodes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.”
A second charge in the JTC complaint alleged that Knoll “treated the police with disrespect.”     
FC 107 Knoll Complaint 
According to the complaint, Knoll threatened the Grand Haven police officer who responded to the scene, saying that if he was not subsequently prosecuted, an officer’s “ass would be in a sling for a false arrest.”
The complaint requires Knoll to respond by May 6.
The Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission investigates complaints of judicial misconduct and incapacity, and can recommend discipline to the Michigan Supreme Court, which has the ability to censure, suspend, retire, or remove a judge from office.
Knoll was first elected in 2002. He was most recently re-elected in November 2020, when he ran unopposed for another six-year term running through December 2026.
He serves as the chief judge of the 58th District Court, after being re-appointed to a two-year term in that role in January 2022.
This will be Knoll’s last term as judge, because state law requires candidates be under 70 years of age at the time of the election. Knoll turned 70 in 2021.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Congress is now in recess through April, returning on May 3. This would be an ideal period for our Montana congressional delegation to meet with their constituents – wouldn’t it?
Don’t hold your breath. A check with the four Capitol Hill offices last week revealed not a one of them had plans for an event where he would take questions and provide answers – with the exceptions of Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy visiting a few high school assemblies to talk about service academy nominations they make.
Some low-profile, personally selected appearances such as Sheehy at a Belgrade community event or what Rep. Troy Downing’s staffer said were small-group or personal visits will occur but there won’t be advance notice to the public. Reporters aren’t welcome – Sheehy turned his back on a television crew after his talk in Miles City. It seems the best way to keep track of them is to get your own “X” account which each uses to boast of his activities. 
Meanwhile, Montana voters have questions, and all four of our millionaire congressmen have pledged to represent all of us, not just those who cast ballots for them.
What if folks requested time of them by using congressional websites to fill out the online scheduling request form each has? Bear in mind that each request requires a lot of information such as name of the host, issue area, number of attendees, preferred dates and times, location and reason for meeting. Each also wants to know in advance the names and hometowns of meeting attendees.
As there is no information in the request forms for any of the four regarding how requests are accepted, we might assume that any topic about the congressman’s work would be regarded as an opportunity to engage in good constituent interchange.
I would like to suggest several topics for voters asking for a meeting or appearance as these questions are being raised across Montana:

Do you have input or prior notification into agency staff and funding decisions handed down by Department Of Government Efficiency?
Do you believe DOGE does enough research and verification before issuing its far-reaching judgments?
As each of you have had corporate experience and responsibility, would you have imposed draconian personnel and funding cuts without fully understanding employee roles and responsibilities in your organization?
Why are government agencies being dismantled without prior congressional involvement since it was Congress that enabled them in the first place?
What will be the role of the 200-some committees and sub-committees in re-forming our government agencies after staff and funding reductions demanded by DOGE?
What is your level of concern for DOGE infiltration in protected information areas held by the Social Security Administration, IRS, Medicare and Medicaid programs and departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury, and others?
Do you support the Supreme Court decision that undocumented immigrants must receive legal due process before being deported?

Here is my point: Our state’s congressional delegation is heeding the orders of the leaders of the House and Senate reelection campaigns to stop holding in-person town halls. We are not all radical leftists, Marxists, Socialists, deranged Democrats, America-haters and all the other insulting labels being attached to us, citizens who honestly questioning what is happening to our country.
If the delegation continues to hide from us – can we smoke ‘em out?",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-34-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 07:01:26.815549

If passengers don’t have a Idaho Star Card, they can use another form of federally-accepted identification at airport security checkpoints, including a U.S. passport, Global Entry card, U.S. Department of Defense ID, military ID or an acceptable photo identification card issued by a federally recognized Native American tribe.
“If you arrive at an airport without a Star Card or another acceptable document, you may be delayed and undergo additional examination,” Idaho Transportation Department officials said in a press release. “This can cause passengers to miss flights.”
  What do you need to provide to obtain an Idaho Star Card? 

To obtain the Idaho Star Card, Idahoans need to provide their Social Security card and two documents proving Idaho residency, such as current utility bills or a mortgage statement. (A list of the documents required to obtain an Idaho Star Card is available online.)

Even though the Real ID/Idaho Star Card enforcement begins May 7, time is already tight. Idahoans who need a Star Card are required to visit an Idaho driver’s license office in person and present a series of documents to obtain the Idaho Star Card. Many Idaho driver’s license offices operate by appointment only, and availability may be several weeks out.
Additionally, it may take up to two weeks for the physical Star Card to be mailed to Idahoans.  
Due to the tight timeline, state transportation officials are offering a couple of tips. 
First, they said Idahoans can visit any county driver’s license office in the state to obtain an Idaho Star Card. If the local office in their county is not accepting appointments in time, transportation officials encourage Idahoans to check with another county driver’s license office for faster service.
Second, Idaho Division of Motor Vehicles officials are encouraging other Idahoans who don’t need an Idaho Star Card or who already have an Idaho Star Card to free up space at physical county driver’s license offices by using online Idaho DMV services. Idahoans can free up space at county DMV offices by going online to handle other tasks, like renewing their vehicle registration, changing their address or renewing an existing driver’s license.
“Online renewals help reduce in-office wait times at locations that allow walk-ins, making it easier and more efficient for those who need a REAL ID (Star Card) to complete their transactions,” Idaho Transportation Department officials said in a press release issued Tuesday.
 



 If Idahoans don’t obtain an Idaho Star Card by May 7 enforcement deadline, they can use the following federally-approved IDs at airport securIty checkpoints 


State-issued Enhanced Driver’s License
U.S. passport
U.S. passport card
DHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)
U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Green Bay-area legislators say the city and state are prepared for the “once-in-a-generation” tourism coming to the region when the NFL draft starts in the city Thursday. 
Green Bay is accustomed to hosting at least eight Packers home games each year, but the draft is expected to bring up to four times as many people to the city as a typical game, according to state Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard). Hotels are booked as far south as Milwaukee and as far west as Wausau, he said, and with that comes additional strain on local resources. 
“We heard early on that public safety led by the city of Green Bay had real concerns at the ballooning costs at having this event policed,” state Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) said. “So they were inviting the county, the state, other officers from outside of the region to come help with the draft, given that we wanted to make sure it was an incredibly safe event in our incredibly safe community. But you know, we want to be aware of things like human trafficking, other challenges, potentially debaucherous behavior, and that footprint between the downtown and Lambeau Field would require more public safety officials, including EMS services, than we even had on hand.”
In the last biennial budget, state lawmakers set aside $2 million to support the draft and in his budget proposal this year, Gov. Tony Evers requested $1 million to assist the city with additional expenses. While the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee rejected Evers’ proposal, Steffen and Rep. Ben Franklin (R-De Pere) have requested $1.25 million in the budget to reimburse public safety departments in Green Bay, Brown County and Ashwaubenon for the added costs incurred in planning for and managing the hundreds of thousands of visitors. 
Steffen told the Wisconsin Examiner his proposal is better because it is specifically carved out for police and fire departments but that the additional $1.25 million — funded out of the state’s nearly $5 billion budget surplus — will help local officials manage the event while still making it a net benefit for the state. He said he anticipates the draft generating $4.5 million in sales tax revenue for the state. 
“So this is still a net financial winner for the state, but having the county, city and village shoulder all those expenses on the property taxpayers for this statewide benefiting event doesn’t seem appropriate,” Steffen said. 
Cleveland, Detroit and Kansas City have all hosted the NFL draft in recent years, but despite the event’s success in other midwestern cities, both Rivera-Wagner and Steffen say Green Bay’s status as the smallest city in the country to be the home of a major professional sports team makes the event here unique. 
“I think a lot of people are going to be coming because of the unique nature of Lambeau Field and Green Bay in professional sports,” Steffen said. “There is nothing like it anywhere else in the nation in terms of an experience.”
Last year, business owners in the Milwaukee area were left frustrated after the city hosted the Republican National Convention because of its muted benefit to local businesses. Rivera-Wagner, who worked as chief of staff for Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich prior to his election to the Legislature, said the city met with officials from Detroit and Kansas City to learn how to make sure the draft benefits the city at large and not just the area around Lambeau Field. 
“You have to be purposeful to make these large-scale events impact the larger community, because, in and of themselves, if they’re overly contained, they cannot necessarily have the impact that you might anticipate,” he said. 
The city has set up a series of events in its downtown area, including a kringle making competition, a 5k run and an early opening of the city’s normal downtown farmer’s market before its typical May start. These events, according to Rivera-Wagner, are meant to engage locals and visitors while not causing the event to cast such a large footprint that people trying to avoid the crowds can’t do so. 
“We took those lessons to heart and created this entire downtown experience based on the feedback that we learned from Kansas City and Detroit about celebrating our community, making sure this event isn’t just for outsiders, that is also for the residents of our community and make sure that economic footprint is as big, as broad as possible without interfering with the people who want to opt out,” he said. 
Steffen said that even though people visit Green Bay from elsewhere each home-game Sunday during football season, they often fly in and out quickly. But because the draft is a three-day event — with lots of down time before a fan’s team makes its pick each round — the draft gives Green Bay a better opportunity to show itself off. 
“Because this is a multi-day event where the majority of the activity is in the afternoon and evening, there’s going to be lots of opportunity in the early parts of each day for people to experience the rest of Green Bay,” he said. “And so we have free transportation arranged throughout the city, from the various hotels to the draft experience, as well as to places like our vibrant downtown areas and our state renowned amusement park Bay Beach. So these are things that I think we’ll be taking advantage of at a level that far exceeds a typical Packer game.”

A former library official is pushing back against the political forces that ended her decades-long career, as the Legislature enters the debate over library books.
The post Legal fight over Gillette librarian’s firing expands as Wyoming lawmakers weigh action appeared first on WyoFile .","A former library official is pushing back against the political forces that ended her decades-long career in the Campbell County Public Library system, bringing her second of two federal lawsuits this month, accusing local government and an activist family of discrimination and wrongful termination. 
The Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees fired Terri Lesley from her job in July 2023, after the director of the county library system resisted calls to censure books dealing with questions of sexuality among teens and young adults, particularly LGBTQ+ youth. 
Two months after her firing, Lesley sued members of a family, the Bennetts, who had prominently advocated for her removal as library director. This week, she brought a new federal lawsuit against the county, its board of commissioners, the library board and individual members of both government boards. The new suit accuses local officials of violating the First Amendment’s right to free speech and firing Lesley in a retaliatory and discriminatory way. 
Sage Bear, who sits on the library board and is the wife of House Appropriations Chairman and Wyoming Freedom Caucus leader John Bear, is one of the defendants. Lesley’s lawsuit alleges Sage Bear played a key role in driving the librarian from her job. 
By text message, Rep. Bear said he believed his wife had been counseled not to comment by her attorneys. WyoFile reached out to the private attorneys on both sides of Lesley’s lawsuits, including her Denver-based law firm, but did not receive responses by day’s end Wednesday.

A representative for the Campbell County Attorney’s office said it was too early for the agency to comment on the lawsuit against the county, which was filed Monday. Court records indicate the county has yet to be served with the lawsuit. 
Lesley notched a legal victory in her first lawsuit earlier this month, as U.S. District Court of Wyoming Judge Alan Johnson ruled that half of her claims against the Bennetts can proceed to trial. He also tossed a motion for dismissal. 
Both lawsuits come as the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which controls the House, promises to thrust the Legislature into the debate over library books. The Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee has taken on the state’s obscenity laws as a topic to study from now until the 2026 legislative session, and conservative lawmakers will likely push for laws banning books that discuss sexuality from libraries where they can be accessed by minors. 
Librarian directors from around the state opposed a bill along those lines during the most recent legislative session. The House Judiciary Committee ultimately tabled that bill, electing to study it between sessions.
Lesley’s firing marked the culmination of two years of fierce political debate in Campbell County, during which Lesley became a target of activists opposed to LGBTQ+ literature for young people in public libraries. 
Those activists, namely the Bennett family, called for Lesley to be fired and even pressed the Campbell County District Attorney’s Office to charge her for providing obscene material to minors, according to the longer-running lawsuit, which Lesley filed in September 2023. It names as defendants Kevin, Hugh and Susan Bennett.
Prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting what they described as an extensive review of state statutes. The county attorney found that the books in question did not meet the statute’s definition of obscene materials, which requires sexual content to also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
WyoFile reached Kevin Bennett by phone on Wednesday, and he declined to comment.
In their response to Lesley’s lawsuit, an attorney for the Bennetts says they were exercising their own free speech rights and were not responsible for firing Lesley.
Policy debate
The Joint Judiciary Committee, which meets next month for the first time since the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, does not have a set direction when it comes to the obscenity law topic, House chairman Art Washut, R-Casper, told WyoFile. The committee might pursue a change to criminal statutes as outlined in this year’s failed bill, or seek to “compel school districts and library boards to certify compliance in some way,” he wrote in a text message.
“It is wide open at this point, but there was strong support to rein in the idea that open access of all materials to kids is appropriate,” Washut wrote. 
Conservatives are trying to outlaw LGBTQ+ material under the guise of protecting children, said Sara Burlingame, executive director of gay-rights advocacy group Wyoming Equality. Library books that describe the experience of LGBTQ+ youth carry immense value to young people grappling with their emerging sexuality, she said, particularly in Wyoming’s rural communities and small towns. 
“Wyoming Equality supports the freedom to access books for the public,” she said. “Anything that reinforces that the public is made up of a diverse group of individuals which includes gay, lesbian, Two Spirit and transgender people, that has to be fought for over and over again.” 
The drive to create new laws targeting certain books was irreconcilable with American democratic ideals, she said. Any effort to stand up to that, like Lesley’s lawsuit, was cheered by Wyoming Equality, she said.
“People keep waiting for what the line is, and when they’re coming for books, that’s it,” she said. “That’s your cue. That’s the line.”
In the crosshairs after a long career
According to her lawsuit, Lesley spent 27 years working for the library system, and 11 as its director. “In 2021, however, the highly politicized vilification of LGBTQ+ communities and book-banning craze engulfing the country landed on her doorstep, with grave consequences,” her attorneys wrote. 
Bigotry, not genuine concern for young people, drove Campbell County activists to push Lesley out of her job, and local officials abetted them instead of standing firm for free speech and equal rights, the lawsuit alleged. 
In June, which is Pride Month, of that year, the library system made a Facebook post celebrating Rainbow Book Month — an initiative of the American Library Association, which describes it as a “nationwide celebration” of books reflecting the lives and experiences of LGBTQ+ people. That post caught the attention of two then-county commissioners, Del Shelstad and Colleen Faber, who are both defendants in this week’s lawsuit.
According to the suit, Shelstad said the county commission had not recognized Pride Month, though it is a national celebration and President Joe Biden had recognized it that year. Shelstad and Faber did not respond to WyoFile messages requesting comment.

After that, library books became a topic of frequent discussion at Campbell County Commission meetings. Hugh Bennett suggested promoting Pride Month was “the ground game of an attempt to destroy our culture and our country,” while Kevin Bennett said exposing young people to questions of sexuality was “pedophilic” and would drive increases in drug addiction and suicide, according to the complaint.
“The Bennetts and other activist residents voiced explicit anti-LGBTQ+ rationales for their requests to remove books, virulently vilifying LGBTQ+ individuals,” the lawsuit read.
At another meeting, former lawmaker Scott Clem, who is now on the Campbell County Commission, said the library was “promoting the basest of base things in our society,” the complaint read, and urged the county not to “promote animalistic behaviors.”

In 2021, the library board backed Lesley, supporting her efforts to promote Rainbow Book Month, according to the lawsuit. 
Lesley’s hiring of a magician further inflamed Campbell County’s conservatives. The magician, who was hired to perform shows at the Wright and Gillette branches, is transgender, though her gender identity was not part of her planned act, which was instead a simple magic show for children. The show did not touch on LGBTQ+ issues at all, the magician said at the time, and Lesley has said the performer was not hired because she was transgender. 
Library staff did not in fact know the magician was transgender until someone in Campbell County dug into her background, according to the lawsuit. But Shelstad, Clem and others fixated on the magician’s gender identity, according to the lawsuit.
Eventually, the magician cancelled the shows, citing safety concerns. 
Controversy, then firing 
Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Bennetts and others sought to get some books removed from the library or move them into a certain area inaccessible to minors. Lesley and the library board continued to rebuff those efforts, saying it would be illegal censorship. 
Over time, however, the county commission replaced the library board with people, like Sage Bear, who were more determined to censor certain books, and who opposed Lesley’s stance. In March 2022, a deputy county attorney sought to warn Shelstad that appointing a board with the goal of removing LGBTQ-friendly books and firing Lesley could expose the county to a lawsuit.
“Litigation regarding censorship — which is waiting in the wings on all sides — would be cripplingly costly, time consuming, and very likely unsuccessful for the County,” the attorney wrote, according to a copy of her email included in the lawsuit.
But by July 2023, the board was dominated by people opposed to Lesley’s actions, and she was fired in a 4-1 vote. At the board’s request, her replacement created a special section in the library for the challenged books, according to the lawsuit. 
Lesley’s lawsuits have the support of the Wyoming Library Association, which represents the state’s librarians. “Terri dedicated her career to providing library services to her community,” the group’s president, Lindsey Travis, wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
Wyoming libraries do not hold materials that are legally considered obscene, Travis said, and “we believe that only parents and guardians have the right to decide what materials are best for their own children.” 
Travis hopes Lesley’s lawsuit will get the attention of the state’s politicians, she said, and “encourage lawmakers to better understand the purpose of their local libraries, to see how libraries hold essential roles in their communities, and to support the ways libraries and librarians uphold the tenets of the First Amendment.”

To preserve political parties in Wyoming, party leaders should follow the law, guest columnist David Hill opines.
The post Keep the kite flying appeared first on WyoFile .","I have often heard the story of the young boy flying a kite with his dad. Together they watched as their kite flew higher and higher. Eventually, the kite ran out of string, and the boy encouraged his father to let the string go so the kite could continue to rise. The dad explained that if he let go, the kite would fall. 

Opinion

The boy persisted, and eventually the dad agreed to let the string go. Immediately, the kite began to fly erratically and soon fell to the ground. The dad then explained to his son that although the string appeared to keep the kite from going higher, it was the string that kept the kite anchored and in the air.
Like the string that allows the kite to fly by providing an anchor and direction, so too does the rule of law keep society aloft.
Unfortunately, I have seen instances when groups have tried to evade the rule of law to fly without restrictions. One notable example is the recent elections of officers for the Park County GOP. 
On March 13, the Park County GOP came together for the election of its executive committee. This was done even though members of the executive committee knew there hadn’t been proper statutory notice of 10 days under W.S. 22-4-105. Before the vote started, a point of order was brought stating since there had not been proper notice, the election could not take place. A motion to suspend the bylaws requiring notice was made, but the motion was ruled out of order because state statute requires the notice, and statutes cannot be suspended. The election was rescheduled for March 31.
On March 31, the party reconvened — this time with proper statutory notice — to elect officers. While adopting voting rules, a motion was made to follow the state statute, which prohibits individuals from voting if they are not precinct committee people. The statutes regarding voting in these elections have been interpreted by the Wyoming Supreme Court to specifically restrict unelected executive committee members from voting. However, members of the executive committee presented a decision by the Wyoming GOP Dispute Resolution Committee claiming that statutes cannot control political parties. A motion was made to exclude the unauthorized people from voting because the party could not suspend state statute (much like the ruling made on March 13), but the motion was killed by the executive committee without a vote.
Why does this matter?
In Wyoming, political parties are specifically recognized by statute. As such, these bodies have certain privileges and rules that other social groups do not have. Two prime examples of the privileges of political parties are the ability to nominate candidates to fill vacant elected offices, like a county assessor, superintendent of public education, state treasurer or U.S. senator, and the use of public ballots to select their precinct representatives. To balance these privileges, political parties are required to follow basic statutory requirements.
Sadly, our political parties appear to fight against statutory control, arguing that they are merely a social club like the local Elks Lodge. At the same time, political parties are uninterested in relinquishing the same statutory powers that set them apart from groups like the Elks. 
However, if political parties are in fact no different from other local social clubs, it would be surprising if statutes were not amended to remove the constraints AND privileges political parties currently have. Followed to its logical end, removing political parties from our statutes would prohibit them from selecting nominees when filling vacant elected offices, resulting in a different process to fill vacancies like special elections. Primary elections would likely become more open like California’s “jungle primaries”, and parties would not be allowed to use public ballots for selecting their precinct representatives.
Perhaps some aim to remove parties from politics — an idea that George Washington likely would have supported. However, for those who do not want to see the systematic dismantling of political parties in Wyoming, I suggest we make one thing a priority: follow the law!
Just as a kite cannot have its string cut and refuse to obey the laws of physics, society cannot function to its fullest potential without laws. As for political parties, we cannot become so accustomed to our lofty privileges that we are willing to cut the statutory strings that attach us to society and not expect any consequences.

His message to lawmakers was simple: listen to individuals’ stories about […]","Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and UW-Madison Jennifer Mnookin told lawmakers that the DEI practices throughout the system are constantly evolving. President of the Dane County NAACP chapter Greg Jones was the only member of the public to testify at a Joint Audit Committee hearing Tuesday on two recent audits into the diversity, equity and inclusion practices of state agencies and the Universities of Wisconsin. His message to lawmakers was simple: listen to individuals’ stories about the impact of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and stay away from politicized attacks on DEI. 
“If the question is about whether DEI is functioning or not, whether it’s effective or not, then do it — assess it, examine it and make the case, but don’t let the politicized environment we now face become an issue of concern,” Jones said. 
Jones told lawmakers on the committee about his own experience working in what was then known as the American Ethnic Coordinate office at UW-Eau Claire many years ago. His responsibilities in that “first iteration for the stuff called DEI, belonging and so forth” was ensuring that African-American, Native American, Hispanic American and white students were comfortable on campus. 
“It caused me to do a lot of different things. I worked with them to facilitate transportation back home to Kenosha, Racine when they lost a family member, helped them get that money from the financial aid office, advocated for them with English teachers who wouldn’t accept Black English as a… method of communication in the class, even when writing poetry, short stories, or any other literary form,” Jones said. 
Jones added that these efforts helped students succeed in school and were designed to accomplish similar goals to the many DEI initiatives across UW campuses today. 
“They’re trying to do the same thing: make those students, who don’t live in those communities, are not from those communities, who don’t relate culturally, racially, ethnically, economically to members of that community, [feel] comfortable.”
Jones’ comments came after four hours of back and forth between the leaders of the state Department of Administration (DOA) and the University of Wisconsin system, who defended their DEI practices, and lawmakers on the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. Republicans on the committee pressed the leaders on the results of recent audits and criticized DEI efforts saying they are “racist” and do not benefit the state.
Republican lawmakers launched the audits into DEI practices last year after getting concessions from the UW system on cutting back DEI in 2023. The lawmakers then expressed their intent to continue targeting and trying to eliminate diversity programs. 
The audit results, which were released earlier this month, come as Republican lawmakers have felt emboldened by a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended consideration of race in admission processes and as the Trump administration has made targeting and eliminating DEI efforts, especially in K-12 and higher education, one of its top priorities. According to a recent poll by Pew Reseach Center, 54% of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration’s actions to end DEI in the federal government, while 44% approve. 
Committee co-chair Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) opened the hearing on the audits by attacking diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that it “abandons the pursuit of a colorblind society” and demands “stereotyping.” He said the audits “expose the waste and unconstitutionality of rebranded discrimination based on immutable characteristics.”

Wimberger added he would be seeking information from leaders on how the practices would be “abandoned” or how each DEI initiative “satisfies a compelling government interest and is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest.”
The DOA audit focused on actions that have been taken in accordance with Executive Order 59, which Gov. Tony Evers signed in 2019 to instruct state agencies to create equity and inclusion plans. Auditors analyzed how much is spent by agencies for DEI activities, including for staffing, and reviewed reported outcomes resulting from DEI activities.
The audit found that none of the 24 state agencies tracked the amount they were spending on DEI, though the audit attempts to estimate some of the costs. According to the audit in 2023-24, agencies spent $2.16 million for salary costs for positions with job duties pertaining to DEI, $705,300 for salary costs for time spent attending diversity, equity, and inclusion training required by the executive order, $444,300 on costs for completing certain actions listed in equity and inclusion action plans and $200,200 for salary costs for time spent attending meetings of DEI committees.
It also found that agencies did not consistently document that they had corrected issues of noncompliance that DOA had identified, and that DOA did not consistently require agencies to take corrective action. The audit recommended that DOA improve its monitoring efforts and ensure that it comply with the executive order and other statutory and administrative rules related to affirmative action. 
The UW audit found that UW institutions planned DEI activities and programs mostly at an institutional level, and not across the board. There is no system wide definition of DEI and implementation of DEI activities were left up to the decision of each institution.
The UW audit similarly found that spending related to DEI was not specifically tracked across the system. According to the audit during the 2023-24 fiscal year, there were $40,221,000 in costs for UW offices with duties pertaining to DEI, $12,484,900 in estimated salary costs for positions with duties related to DEI and $7,911,900 in working on certain diversity, equity, and inclusion activities listed in selected strategic plans and diversity, equity, and inclusion plans.
Republicans expressed contempt for DEI related programs and practices repeatedly throughout the hearing.
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) said at one point that he was “encouraged by the lack of implementation” of Evers’ executive order.
“The programs are disgusting. It’s racist,” Kapenga said. 
Democrats on the committee rejected Republicans’ characterizations of DEI — defending the practices and also seeking to understand the cost of the audit itself, which took 10 months to complete and included extensive interviews by the LAB of the agencies and UW institutions to compile the information included.
Rep. Sequanna Taylor (D-Milwaukee) said that DEI practices are not meant to be racist. 
“It is meant to be a step … so that we ensure everyone is successful in their learning opportunities,” Taylor said.

Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) asked LAB how much money was spent preparing the report.
State Auditor Joe Chrisman said the LAB spent about $423,000.
DOA says practices help recruit new state employees 
In her testimony, DOA Secretary-designee Kathy Blumenfield said that her agency’s  DEI practices have been beneficial for recruiting and retaining employees. 
Blumenfield also reminded lawmakers that a year ago when lawmakers were launching the audit she told them it would be hard because the work of DEI “isn’t done exclusively by one agency, nor is it a program staffed by specific employees with policies and procedures.” She brought up concerns about the methodology of the audit, saying that the audit likely overstated costs.
One example, Blumenfield said, was in relation to town hall events that were hosted by the Department of Workforce Development. The audit lists the events as costing $165,400 in 2023-24, however, Blumenfield said DEI wasn’t the main focus. 
“The content of these meetings included a wide variety of other topics unrelated to [the executive order]… Only 12% of the town hall meeting could be associated with [the executive order], which would equate to a cost of only $19,800 — reducing [the agency’s] total estimated cost by 86%,” Blumenfield said. 
Blumenfield also said that many of the activities and positions that were covered in the audit existed in previous administrations and were already required by state law — before the Evers executive order. 
Blumenfield said she thinks DEI practices have been beneficial to the state and that “luckily” the audit didn’t opine on whether DEI was good or bad. 
“This was very, very difficult and very, very challenging,” Blumenfield said, adding that she sees the audit as actually “telling us to lean in more to this work.” 
“If you look at the actual recommendations out of the audit, it’s saying do more in this space,” Blumenfield continued. 
Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said he is concerned with whether the audit finds the agency  complies with the law and DEI programs are a good use of state resources. He said he couldn’t “wrap my head around” why the state needs DEI to recruit candidates. 
Blumenfield said that DOA is complying with the law and that the agency is trying to explore ways, including nontraditional ones, to ensure the workforce represents the people of Wisconsin better.
“What you just said there is super important because you didn’t say we want our applicants [to be] a little more diverse,” Born said. “You said you want the workforce… How do you make it look more like the state if you’re not hiring people based on race … gender or whatever?”
DOA legislative advisor Cara Connors responded that outreach is important. 
“Historically, you had folks who didn’t even apply to state jobs,” Connors said. She added that outreach was “not because we need to put a thumb on the scale in the hiring process and look at race. It was that we needed to get these people to apply to jobs in the first place.”
One example they used to illustrate the point is outreach to female engineers. 
“Female engineers are really hard to come by. [The Public Service Commission] has a really hard time just retaining and recruiting engineers, so they’ve sent their female engineers to the career fairs and all of a sudden they’re attracting more female engineers,” Blumenfield said. “This isn’t rocket science.”
In response to a question from Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown), Blumenfield clarified that there are no quotas for these programs. 
“If I’m at a career fair and I’m a woman and I don’t see anyone that looks like me, you know, I might not be as excited to apply with that organization as if I see someone that I can see myself in,” Blumenfield said. 
Knodl asked whether there are any engineer positions currently open.
“Are there male engineers available to fill those spots? Are you keeping them open for female engineers?” Knodl asked.
“No we don’t do that,” Connors responded. Blumenfield asked if he knew any engineers, and Knodl said his son is an engineer.
Wimberger argued that by implementing DEI programs, people are presuming things about people based on “immutable characteristics.” 
“Respectfully, Senator, I think this committee is conflating this idea of what DEI is with what’s actually happening at the state agencies,” Connor said. “What’s happening at the state agencies is what the secretary is describing. It’s this effort to recruit and retain talent in line with [several factors].” She used the example of the American with Disabilities Act, noting that it’s an anti-discrimination law.
“If I’m building a building, and I have multiple floors, I have to have an elevator, I have to have ramps,” Connors said. 
“If I wanted to help people with disabilities, would I build a ramp?” Wimberger asked. 
“If you want them to access your building,” Connors said. 
“Not if their disability isn’t related to mobility,” Wimberger shot back.
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff asked about the time the agencies spent complying with the audit.  
Blumenfield said they spent over 600 hours — or more than 75 eight-hour work days.
“That took us, actually, away from the work that we were doing to try and achieve a lot of the outcomes,” Blumenfield said.
UW leaders say DEI efforts focused on student success
Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and UW-Madison Jennifer Mnookin told lawmakers that the DEI practices throughout the system are constantly evolving and are  important to student success. 
Rothman said he has come to think of DEI as “a broad concept that includes differences in political ideology and religious beliefs, first generation status, disabled status, veteran status, in addition to those who would come from historically underrepresented groups” and that UW’s  focus is “on each individual student as an individual to ensure their success as a student and to ensure that they leave our universities with enhanced level of cultural competency.” 
Wimberger asked about whether UW-Madison has scholarships that consider race.
 
Mnookin said that while it was considered as a “modest” factor in admissions before the U.S. Supreme Court decision, that is no longer the case. She added that the U.S. Supreme Court decision does not directly speak to scholarships and that there are a few exceptions to this at UW-Madison because of some state statutes.
“Nobody is getting a scholarship from UW Madison on the basis of the racial preference,” Mnookin said. “We also are no longer accepting new scholarships from donors that call out identity characteristics in that way.”  
Some Republican lawmakers also asked about LaVar J. Charlteston, the UW-Madison chief diversity officer who was demoted from his position due to financial concerns including “highly atypical and excessive spending across multiple dimensions — from bonuses to compensation adjustments to travel, supplies and furnishings.” Wimberger asked if UW would fill the position he left vacant. 
Mnookin said she has a new part-time advisor, but it is not the same. 
“It is not at all the same role that Dr. Charlteston had,” Mnookin said. “We were trying to think about what does pluralism look like? How do we create a culture where conversations across our differences, no matter your identity or no matter your beliefs, are something that is happening?”
Mnookin said they are also working on implementing new financial controls with consultation from Deloitte to help prevent further occurrences like this.
“I don’t begrudge you for doing that,” Wimberger said. 
Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia), who expressed concerns about the variety of DEI definitions on campus, asked Rothman what the system is going to do to work on setting a standard across campuses.
“There was the sense coming out of the audit that we didn’t have a sense of what’s going on. I don’t think that’s a fair characterization,” Rothman said.
During the hearing, Rothman commended Mnookin for her work, particularly naming the Deliberation Dinners she has hosted, which are an opportunity for students to participate in conversations about controversial issues. Mnookin said it is part of their work to make people feel included on campus.
“Part of what we are trying to create — and, Senator, I acknowledge that we have further work to do — is a place where, whatever your background or your identity you can feel comfortable sharing perspectives,” Mnookin said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Day two of former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada’s federal corruption trial ended with a jury chosen and indications of how defense lawyers could try to keep their client out of prison. 
Casada and his former chief of staff Cade Cothren are on trial for allegations of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, bribery and kickbacks after funneling contracts for political consulting services for state House members to a company founded by Cothren called Phoenix Solutions. 
Casada’s attorney Ed Yarbrough questioned prospective alternate jurors Tuesday about whether they have worked in sales, received commissions in exchange for work — raising the question of whether commissions and kickbacks could be seen as mutually exchangeable terms — or outsourced work to subcontractors. 
“Did your customers always know who was doing the work?” Yarbrough asked. 
Federal prosecutors’ case rests partially on the premise that Casada and former Chattanooga Rep. Robin Smith secured contracts for political consulting services from House Republican Caucus members, receiving a cut of the proceeds from Cothren in return. 
Cothren resigned from his post in May 2019 amid a scandal over racist and sexist text messages that was heavily reported by Nashville-area media. He formed Phoenix Solutions in 2020 and prosecutors allege Casada and Smith purposely concealed Cothren’s identity on the assumption House members would not contract with Phoenix if they knew Cothren was behind it. 
Opening arguments will begin Thursday morning.

(Getty Images)Last week the Andrus Center at Boise State University and the McClure Center at the University of Idaho held a conference to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. The conference focused on the legislative miracle that led to the preservation of the deepest canyon in North America.
This stunning canyon, used by jet boaters, rafters, hikers, hunters and many more, could not have been saved from the construction of a large dam if it weren’t for many persistent Idahoans who opposed the dam.
But it also took the strong bipartisan and visionary leadership of political leaders who came together to pass the legislation that became the Hells Canyon Recreation Area – namely Democratic U.S. Sen. Frank Church and Republican U.S. Sen. Jim McClure of Idaho and Oregon Republican U.S. Sens. Bob Packwood and Mark Hatfield.
It also could not have been protected without the leadership of Idaho’s Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus, and Oregon’s Republican Gov. Tom McCall, and Washington’s Republican Gov. Dan Evans. Their personal relationship and political collaboration on Hells Canyon and other issues led the press to dub them the “three Musketeers.”
Collaboration by Oregon, Idaho and Washington’s ‘Three Musketeers’ led to golden age of governors

Many of the conference speakers, including me, concluded that if another major, regional issue like Hells Canyon arose today there is not the bipartisan and deep personal relationships that could resolve it like the ones 50 years ago.  
But in retrospect, there is one thing that could potentially create the kind of leadership these amazing leaders provided in the early 1970s – saving our public lands from being auctioned off to the highest bidder. But, even then, it would require a change of heart from most of our current lawmakers or the election of more pro-public land political leaders.
 Public lands facing greater threat than any other time in U.S. history

Today we are facing the greatest threat to our public lands than at any time in history. The feeling of dread was demonstrated a few weeks ago when an estimated 2,000 Idahoans rallied at the Statehouse demanding that the Trump administration and Congress keep their hands off our public lands.
Their concern is real.
Politico recently reported that Congressional Republicans are looking at selling off public lands around the national parks to help finance President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, including a $5 billion income tax cut. 
On April 3, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright announced that the Trump administration plans to make 16 sites on federal lands available to private companies to build artificial intelligence data centers. One of those sites is the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls. 
Last Sunday an opinion writer for The New York Times suggested that federal lands near cities could be used to expand badly needed housing. He cited “Boise” as one of those cities. Of course, he wrote there should be sideboards to prevent this land from just being used to build the kind of McMansions we see cropping up across the West. 
Idaho Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo recently voted against an amendment that would prevent the selling of public land. It failed on a 48-51 vote, meaning Risch and Crapo’s votes sank it. Meanwhile, Congressman Mike Simpson split from the rest of the Idaho delegation supporting the bipartisan Keep Public Lands in Public Hands legislation.
Utah last year sued the federal Bureau of Land Management to force the agency to turn over 18 million acres of so-called “unappropriated” lands to the state. The word “unappropriated” is the kind of misleading buzzword privatizers have used to advance other efforts such as privatizing public schools.
In this case, “unappropriated” implies that these lands are not being used, and the state should take them back. The truth is that these lands are used for grazing, mining, wildlife habitat, recreation, and many other uses. 
The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected the Utah case. But Utah Gov. Spencer Cox is on a mission to make the transfer happen, even threatening to file a lawsuit in federal district court.

Cox has also launched a $1 million public relations campaign called “Stand for Our Land,” implying that somehow these lands owned by all Americans are under threat. His message has appeared on billboards, in TV commercials and in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, hoping to build public support for the idea. 
And if you think this is just a threat from Utah, consider that Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador joined Cox last year by filing a brief to get these “unappropriated” lands transferred to the states.
 Plans to gut federal agencies like BLM, Forest Service under Trump administration

Meanwhile, President Trump and Elon Musk are gutting the federal agencies responsible for managing the BLM, U.S. Forest Service, and national park lands. Agricultural Secretary Brooke Rollins was quoted in Government Executive News recently as saying department employees, including those in the U.S. Forest Service, should expect significant layoffs in the coming weeks. She said the layoffs will make the Forest Service “more efficient.”
Plans include reducing the regional Forest Service offices from 10 to as few as three. It also includes laying off workers in the Forest Service’s research division, including employees conducting fire suppression, reforestation, and water research. And it includes reducing the number of national forests by consolidating them. 
President Trump has already issued an executive order declaring an “emergency situation” on national forests. The plan is to bypass environmental laws and cut 25 percent more timber. If you look at a map of the land mass that will be impacted by this executive order, it covers Idaho like a blanket from north of Boise to the Canadian border.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little calls for increase in federal forests management to reduce wildfire risk

These expected layoffs in the Forest Service will make it more difficult for the remaining employees to manage the extensive public lands in the West. No doubt the so-called “emergency” will lead to a denigration of the land and a reduction in service to the millions of Americans who hike, fish, hunt, snowmobile, and graze livestock on these lands. 
This denigration of the lands and the negative service citizens experience from these staffing cuts will set the table for the privatizers to come in with the “solution” to the very problem they created. That “solution” will be turning our public lands over to the states or selling them outright to wealthy elites who can afford them. 
This playbook is the same one that has been used to privatize public education in our country. For years billionaires and their mis-named front organizations like Besty DeVos’ American Federation for Children and Charles Koch’s Americans for Prosperity have declared that our public schools are “failing” our children. Then they come in with the “solution” – privatize education by providing vouchers to private and religious schools.
Here’s how Christopher Rufo, a far-right thought leader, explained the playbook to an audience at Hillsdale College: First “attack the credibility of the institutions.” Then create the “conditions for fundamental, structural change.” For example, he said, “to get universal school choice, you really need to operate from a position of universal public-school distrust.”  
In other words, if Cox and Labrador and congressional Republicans are going to get the public lands transferred to the states, they must convince the public that the lands are under threat. That explains Cox’s expensive “Stand for Our Land” propaganda campaign. 
The truth is that the states cannot afford to manage our public lands. The Legislature would have to appropriate millions more to expand the state Lands Department. A major fire alone would cost millions of dollars, stressing the state general fund budget.
 Under state management and privatization, the most beautiful, valuable parts of Idaho will be auctioned off

Furthermore, the Idaho Constitution mandates that state lands be managed for maximum economic gain, not for multiple uses like outdoor recreation. That’s why state-owned home sites around Payette Lake and Priest Lake have been auctioned off to the highest bidder in recent years. 
If the state gets its hands on BLM and Forest Service land, it will have to sell some of it off to cover the cost of management and fire suppression. And you can bet that it will be the most beautiful and valuable parts of Idaho that will be auctioned off. And you can also bet your last dollar that it won’t be average Idahoans who can afford to bid – it will be billionaires from Texas, California, and hedge funds back East that will gobble up our land. 
And, if you think that is far-fetched, remember the billionaire Wilks brothers from Texas who bought hundreds of square miles of Idaho from private interests and soon closed it to the public which previously had access to the land. One of those brothers, Farris Wilks, knows how the privatization game works. Last year Wilks teamed up with another Texas billionaire, Tim Dunn, to defeat anti-private school voucher Republican legislators in Texas, according to ProPublica and other news outlets.  
Recent Idaho political history shows that out-of-state billionaires like DeVos have outsized power and bottomless bank accounts to change our Legislature and advance their school privatization agenda. They could use the same strategy and bank accounts to advance the privatization of our public lands.
We cannot let the wealthy privatizers, or their complicit politicians do that. We need visionary leaders like Idaho’s Sens. Frank Church and Jim McClure and governors like Andrus, McCall, and Evans more now than ever. 
Our public lands are what makes Idaho special and different from states like Kansas where there is no public land or wild and scenic rivers. Or Texas where one must pay to play. Or some eastern states where there are more concrete slabs than wild forests and valleys.
Our public lands are what makes Idaho, Idaho. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to protect our public lands and give them and their children the same opportunities to renew their spirits under the bluebird skies of our great state.

(Source: Entergy Arkansas)Two coal-fired power plants in Arkansas are exempt from revised air pollution rules under a Trump administration rollback of environmental standards adopted last year, leaving some former EPA officials and environment groups concerned about prolonged exposure to unhealthy emissions.
The exemptions will last for two years, long enough to keep one plant already slated for closure from having to install equipment required by the new rules.
As part of its deregulation efforts, the Trump administration put out a call earlier this year for companies to request exemptions to several environmental rules finalized in Biden’s last year in office. The Clean Air Act allows the president to exempt pollution sources from compliance with any part of section 112 of the CAA if “the technology to implement the standard is not available and it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.” 
Entergy Arkansas’ White Bluff 1 power station near Redfield and the Plum Point Energy Station near Osceola, which is owned by a consortium of utility companies, applied for the exemption.

Had President Donald Trump not directed the Environmental Protection Agency to provide the exemptions, the plants would have been required to install continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) to measure the amounts of particulates released into the air. The plants also would have been subject to stricter regulations for how much particulate matter they could release through their stacks.
Instead, the plants will only be subject to the version of the rule prior to the 2024 revisions. The plants now have until 2029 to comply with the requirements finalized last year — that is, if they remain in effect.
The Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) rule is one of more than two dozen environmental and pollution regulations being targeted for rollbacks by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. In a statement announcing the deregulation targets in March, Zeldin said the move was a push back against “destruction and destitution” caused by EPA rules enacted in the previous administration.
The White Bluff plant is scheduled to be shut down in 2028, an Entergy Arkansas spokesperson said.
“White Bluff 1 is the only affected unit in Arkansas that may require the installation of additional equipment to meet new MATS requirements coming into effect in 2027, and that same unit is also subject to a requirement to cease burning coal at the end of 2028 under a consent decree,” Matt Ramsey said in an emailed statement. “This exemption will avoid the need to make additional MATS-related investments that increase costs to our customers so close to the cessation of coal date.
“White Bluff 1 will continue to operate under the current MATS standards, which the EPA has determined to be protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety,” Ramsey added. 
MATS matters
The MATS rule was first issued in 2012 to reduce the amount of mercury and other toxics being emitted by coal power plants. Those rules were revised in 2024, during the final months of the Biden administration, requiring all facilities subject to the rule to install CEMS monitoring while tightening the amount of “filterable particulate matter” that a coal power plant could emit.
The revised requirements slashed the amount of particulate matter a coal plant could emit by two-thirds. A fact sheet issued by the EPA last year said that 93% of existing coal plants that were not already set to close already met the revised particulate matter standard.
Particulate matter is used as a surrogate for emissions of mercury, a heavy metal, and other pollutants designated as air toxics under the federal Clean Air Act. Heavy metals can be toxic to humans, and inhaling them can lead to respiratory issues such as asthma.
“Fine particulate matter in the rule and in the science is a proxy for these heavy metals,” explained Sierra Club attorney Tony Mendoza. “So if you’re limiting fine particulate matter to a certain level, EPA found you’re reducing your emissions of mercury and arsenic and nickel.”
Mendoza said he had been surprised that the Plum Point and White Bluff facilities had requested exemptions, saying that documentation put forth by the EPA during the rulemaking process led them to believe it would not be difficult for either plant to comply with the revised rule.
“It seems that they should have been able to comply and there is some non-public reason why they’re seeking that exemption,” Mendoza said. “We were frankly a little surprised to see them on that list.”
Frustration and concern
The chair of the Sierra Club’s Arkansas chapter expressed frustration and concern over the Trump administration’s move. The Sierra Club was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that resulted in the consent decree that requires Entergy to shut down White Bluff and its Independence coal plant within the next ten years.
“Environmental issues tend to work kind of like co-morbidities, where air quality issues on their own might not be causing huge issues for the average Arkansan,” Erica Kriner said, “but then you add poor drinking water from hog farms disposing waste into the Buffalo River; then you add an uptick of diseases that threaten agriculture; and suddenly all of these issues start to snowball with each other.”
Kriner said it was important that Arkansas communities understand the “larger context” of what these actions can mean. She compared the attempts to roll back regulations to a car in need of repair — perhaps it could continue to run at first, but it would eventually stop working.
“Chipping away at our clean air protections may not feel like it will lead to dire consequences, but the Trump administration, the [Sarah] Huckabee Sanders administration, they rely on people not understanding the long-term consequences of dismantling these regulations,” Kriner said.
The exemption from complying with the revised rule was particularly concerning for Joe Goffman, who oversaw the 2024 revisions as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency’s air office during the Biden administration and helped author the section of the Clean Air Act that gave the EPA the authority to regulate so-called “air toxics,” such as mercury, in 1990.
Goffman said the MATS rule exemptions for coal-powered plants would allow these facilities to continue using less frequent testing to demonstrate compliance with the pre-2024 version of the standards, which they are still subject to, if they had not already begun using CEMS.
Goffman said this leaves room for inaccuracies and potentially even manipulation.
“I can say from my many decades of experience in this area — if there was one pollutant” that Congress decided to regulate, “the pollutant to target is PM [particulate matter], because that’s the most dangerous pollutant that makes people sick,” Goffman said. 
That’s because harmful substances – like mercury – “ride” on fine particles.
“A lot of these substances are carried by fine particles,” Goffman said. “In other words, you don’t have these free floating nickel molecules or other heavy metal molecules. They ride on fine particles. That’s what makes them particularly lethal.”
Without a CEMS monitoring mandate for all coal plants, Goffman said, there could be “a lot” of particulate matter that is being emitted that isn’t necessarily reflected in reporting.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Photo illustration by seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.

In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Kneeling on the cold bathroom floor of her apartment, Kisha clutched the pregnancy test she had just picked up from the Walgreens down the street. She waited for a single blue line to appear. Instead, there were two.
“When I looked down at that test, I didn’t believe it,” she said. “I told myself there was just no way. This can’t be happening to me.”

She was pregnant at 41 years old.
With no partner to support her and no financial cushion to fall back on, living paycheck to paycheck, she couldn’t afford to raise a child alone and had no desire to.
Working long shifts for an online retailing company, loading packages for $20 an hour, Kisha was facing a reality that she did not expect — and could not afford.
“I knew exactly what my next steps would be,” she said.
That step would be an abortion.
As the Trump administration moved to pause Planned Parenthood’s funding and a federal court ruled against criminalizing doctors in Alabama for helping patients seek abortions across state lines, Black women in the South are sounding the alarm, organizing to defend what’s left of their reproductive freedom.

But living in South Carolina, where a law bans abortions around six weeks of pregnancy, Kisha said she felt like her next steps were under threat. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments about whether her state could cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. That decision will not come until this summer.
The fear has only intensified since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established federal protections for abortion. By giving states the right to restrict or ban abortions altogether, the ruling created a new legal landscape that abortion rights advocates say creates a particular set of hurdles for Black women who already face significant barriers to care.
Medical researchers say that the distinctive threats faced by Black women in the South include the potential for medical discrimination by health care providers, criminalization of pregnant women, and the highest rate of maternal mortality in the nation, which has only increased since the Dobbs decision.
Taken together, researchers say, those issues and others create disproportionately high risks for Black women seeking abortions when compared to their counterparts from other demographic groups.
“People need to understand that the current policies are going to, in a very material way, lead to more Black and brown women in jails, [and] more Black and brown women dying because doctors cannot provide them with the care that they swore an oath to provide,” said Dr. Karenne Fru, an Atlanta-based reproductive endocrinologist and OB-GYN. “I remind people that the biggest risk for a Black woman is getting pregnant.”
In Kisha’s case, she made an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic where she was able to obtain the abortion pill at a reduced cost, and found some much-needed emotional support during a time she calls one of the most gut-wrenching moments of her life.

“I didn’t feel judged,” she said. “They just saw a woman who needed help, and they gave it.”
Kisha agreed to speak with Capital B only on the condition that her last name not be used, out of fear that sharing her story publicly could lead to criminal prosecution under her state’s abortion laws — laws that place the kind of health care she received under threat.
 Abortions, health care and Planned Parenthood under scrutiny

During the first two months of the second Trump administration, the battle over reproductive rights has continued. On April 1, the Trump administration revoked Title X funding for Planned Parenthood, cutting tens of millions from clinics that provide reproductive and preventive health care.
The very next day, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review South Carolina’s attempt to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, a decision that could significantly impact health care access for many low-income residents.
“President Trump and Elon Musk are pushing their dangerous political agenda, stripping healthcare access from people nationwide, and not giving a second thought to the devastation they will cause,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood, said in a statement.
Several Planned Parenthood clinics across Michigan announced their doors would be closing following the latest federal funding cuts. In addition, the cuts drew outrage from Planned Parenthood centers across the South — especially in states like Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, where strict abortion laws already make it harder for people to get care. These states also provide some of the weakest maternal health support in the nation.
“We know the chaos and terror from this administration will impact marginalized communities and people of color the most,” said Ashley Coffield, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi. “This especially puts Black women at risk.”
Abby Ledoux, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said one of her organization’s clinics — serving Louisiana and southeast Texas — was also directly impacted.
“It’s just one in a long line of attacks. We’re doing everything we can to fill the gaps in a broken health care system,” she said.

Fru, a reproductive endocrinologist and OB-GYN, testified in March against Georgia’s House Bill 441 — a law that would ban nearly all abortions by defining life as beginning at fertilization. Her testimony went viral.
Fru’s practice is rooted in helping women conceive. But she also supports patients through miscarriages, failed pregnancies, and medically necessary abortions — highlighting how interconnected reproductive care is.
In states like Georgia, with six-week abortion bans, detecting fetal cardiac activity prevents termination, no matter the circumstances.
Fru said as many as a quarter of all pregnancies “will not make it outside of the first trimester, and at that point, you have to do a lot to prove that it was not willfully terminated.”
She explained that many of her patients have “highly desired pregnancies” — individuals who have paid for fertility treatments to conceive. But when those pregnancies become nonviable, the treatment options often involve the same medication used in abortions.
“I have to put a note at the bottom of their prescription for the pharmacist to see that says this patient has a nonviable, desired pregnancy and is in distress, please dispense the meds as written without questioning her. And the reason I do that is because I have had patients calling me crying. After all, here they’re having the worst day of their life, and now a pharmacist is asking them if they’re using the pills to perform an abortion.”
 Fighting for abortion rights in the South

Fru warns that the growing criminalization of reproductive care affects not just patients, but also the providers trying to help them.
That’s why, for many advocates, a recent federal court ruling in Alabama offered a rare moment of relief. On the same day that the Trump administration cut Title X funds, a U.S. district judge blocked a 2023 Alabama law that criminalized helping women travel across state lines to obtain legal abortions — ruling that the state could not prosecute individuals or providers for doing so.
The lawsuit was brought by a coalition, including the Yellowhammer Fund, which offers financial and logistical support to abortion seekers in the South.
The fund’s executive director, Jenice Fountain, said the group was ready to resume support the moment the ruling came down.
  “People shouldn’t have to go out of state to get health care. Abortion should be free and accessible in this state, and we aren’t there yet,” said Jenice Fountain, executive director of Yellowhammer Fund. (Tosha Gaines)
“We funded an abortion just 15 minutes after the ruling. That’s how urgent and how serious this is for the women who need our help. We can celebrate this victory for a day or two, but we have to get back to work,” Fountain said. “I’d say we are done celebrating. It’s not acceptable that the best we can do for anyone is advise or fund their care out of state. People shouldn’t have to go out of state to get health care. Abortion should be free and accessible in this state, and we aren’t there yet.”
While the judge’s ruling reaffirmed that Alabamians still have the constitutional right to travel and seek legal medical care, even if their home state criminalizes it, for Fountain, the ruling is far from enough.
“Just having Black women watch an entire system fail them is mentally and emotionally horrendous on our bodies. There’s the actual talk of us dying from a lack of health care, and it’s horrendous. And knowing that the collateral for all of this is going to be someone that looks like you. If you’re not trying to kill Black women, what are you trying to do?” Fountain said.
Advocates in other Southern states echoed her concerns. Jules, a health care executive in Tennessee who would only speak on the condition that her last name be withheld, said 60% of the people they support live in West Tennessee, where that state’s Black population is concentrated — and where many residents are low-income or uninsured.
“The Alabama ruling gives us some legal precedent to fight with,” she said. “But legislators are getting more creative with how they attack our services. We’re not in the clear.”
Alexis Alsup, a doula in Knoxville, says Black women in the rural South are often hit the hardest because there aren’t enough resources nearby. She says many also don’t know where to go for help.
For Kisha, the administration’s cuts and restrictions on abortion laws feels deeply personal.
  “Yes, we will suffer under these cuts, and we will also find ways to care for one another,” said Deon Haywood, executive director of Women With a Vision. (Anthony LaMothe Photography of New Orleans)
“This is an attack on women. If it was really about the kids, they’d be reforming foster care or adoption systems. They wouldn’t be making women responsible for systemic problems or policing our bodies,” she said. “And where are the laws that hold men accountable? We don’t get pregnant alone.”
As for her decision — the one she made with a heavy heart — Kisha says it wasn’t easy. And she knows it could’ve been her last chance to have a child.
“I felt super selfish. I couldn’t even tell my mom because I know she wants grandchildren. But I also know that I would’ve felt just as selfish raising a child in these circumstances. I had to forgive myself.”
Longtime advocate Deon Haywood, executive director of Women With a Vision, says Kisha’s story is one of many, woven into a legacy of resistance by Black women across generations.
“Yes, we will suffer under these cuts, and we will also find ways to care for one another,” Haywood said. “Black people are a passionate people, and we are filled with spirit and soul, and that’s what we bring to the streets when we’re fighting back. That’s what we bring to the halls. That’s what we bring to courthouses.
“We take it with us because it’s a part of our DNA left and shared by our ancestors. Because of that, we owe it to ourselves to stay in this fight.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Black-woman-pregnancy-test-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 06:07:31.228370

But the owners of Red Door aren’t so sure about some of their fellow local food growers.
The administration recently eliminated the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program and the related Local Food for Schools Program, and in the process reneged on funds already committed for this year, leaving almost 300 farmers across the state holding the bag, or, in many cases, the seeds.
At Red Door, owners Stacey and Tenzin Botsford won’t be planting the carrot seeds they ordered. “It would be bad business for me to do that,” says Stacey. “Some seeds are already planted, all the onions are, but there’s no reason for me to plant all those carrots.”
Like many other local growers, Red Door actually raises food that people eat. They’re the farmers you know at farmers markets all over the state. They’re also the farmers who help stock super markets with local foods. And, until now, they provided nutritious, locally grown fruits and vegetables to food pantries and schools.
What gets under their skin, Stacey Botsford says, is the arbitrary and capricious cutoff of funds already committed, funds that many farmers were promised and that caused many to invest in infrastructure and hire employees. “The part that really bothers me is, if next year they said, ‘We don’t value that program,’ that’s fine, but you can’t break the contract everyone signed. Now I can’t trust government contracts anymore. I cannot imagine the widespread mistrust of government from this.”
Red Door is probably diversified enough to weather the loss of up to $50,000 in anticipated income, but on a recent chilly spring day, rather than planting carrots, Stacey was searching for new markets.
She says she’s angry and heartbroken about the impact on other growers, including many Hmong farmers who invested in hoop houses and in some cases greenhouses based on projected income. “Greenhouses, you don’t own one unless you have enough to fill it. Heating those suckers is a lot of money. The LSP people were encouraging all the Hmong to build hoop houses and greenhouses. Those are huge investments.”
Local and regional foods are mainstream in most parts of Wisconsin and across the country these days. It’s been a success story of remarkable growth in the past few decades, built on the backs of farmers, many of them young, from a variety of  ethnic backgrounds. Some government assistance was available for hoop houses and other improvements, but for the most part, the growth was organic, from the ground up, without commodity payments or other government support. 
And while the local food programs were buffeted by the recent breach of contract, large commodity growers got a big boost from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to buffer them from the impacts of the Trump administration tariffs. USDA recently announced it will provide $10 billion in direct economic assistance to agricultural producers through the Emergency Crop Assistance Program EECAP for the 2024 crop year. The local foods programs were projected to cost $1 billion nationally.
The payments to commodity growers, notes Botsford, will reward farmers not to grow crops like corn and soybeans. “Government has always subsidized farms. We’ve been subsidizing farmers for years – all the commodity crops – and now they’re paying farmers not to grow crops,” while local commodity growers take their losses, she said. “So, they’re making it impossible to sell what you’ve committed to and giving conventional farms $10 billion not to grow.”
Red Door and hundreds of other farms rely on the Wisconsin Food Hub Cooperative in Waupaca to source and transport their produce. The Food Hub Cooperative is a farmer-owned business supporting the local food system. 
Tara Roberts-Turner, general manager of the Food Hub, likened the suspension of the programs and promised funding to a natural disaster. “This almost happened as fast and as crazy as a hailstorm. It pulls the legs right out from under you, and you’re left saying ‘Whoa, did that really happen?’” she says.
  Tara Turner-Roberts at Wisconsin Food Hub Cooperative.
The Food Hub serves more than 400 Wisconsin farmers, providing transportation and distribution services, along with other grower assistance. Under the LFPA program and its committed funding, the cooperative rented trucks, expanded staff, and coordinated with farmers for supply in preparation in 2025.
The food hub and its growers are working to get the program restored, but there have been few good signs. “If the LFPA is not restored, years of building the local farmer-to-market infrastructure that the Food Hub Cooperative has built for farmers with government investment will be completely thrown out the window,” says Turner-Roberts. 
The cooperative and farmer members are all businesses, Roberts-Turner says. They have business plans, investments, overhead and bottom lines. The programs eliminated by the Trump administration were built on other government efforts to support local food security, she adds. That was an investment in local businesses and communities. “If you were to look at this from a business perspective, they would realize it’s not a very sound decision. They lose all the investment they put in and cut off a bipartisan plan to make the state’s food systems more stable. I think back to when these programs were kicked off, and it was supported by both sides of the aisle,” she says, adding that their farmer members span the political spectrum.
And it’s not just food pantries and schools. Supermarket chains like Kroger, Roundy’s and other grocers buy local foods produced across the state. “Food Hub growers supply over $3 million of produce to larger grocery stories and grocery distribution in the state,” Turner-Roberts says. If the growers don’t survive, local foods will dissipate. “We’re shipping to them year-round, everything from potatoes and apples to crops like zucchini and yellow squash,” she says. “The local Piggly Wiggly here (in Waupaca) has always been about supporting local. The premise is everyone knows this is important, right? When you ask farmers to buy seeds and implements and hire employees and then cut them off, it’s going to make them less likely to participate in those programs. These farmers are members of their communities, but they’re also business people.”
Like cooperative member Stacey Botsford, Turner-Roberts says it’s a heartbreaking time, even as spring planting is under way across the state. Are there any positives? U.S. Sen. Cory Booker has sponsored legislation to honor farmer contracts. “We have not seen any Republicans who have signed on to that,” Turner-Roberts says. “I find it curious. The food hub is not a political program. Food is not political. It’s not just farmers we’re worried about. We’re two to five years into a seven-year project we have with a bunch of partners in state that have basically created middle-of-the-road infrastructure to sustain ourselves as a state, whether it’s schools, pantries, whatever. What this means is that, next emergency we have that threatens our ability to feed ourselves, we’ll have to start all over. In Wisconsin, Meanwhile, at the Food Hub, “We’ve got truck leases three years out. We have to sign leases and find a way to pay for them and hire staff.”
The food hub has farmer cooperators in all 72 counties in the state. As Botsford at Red Door notes, a lot of them are left scratching their heads. “Margins are so narrow in farming, you don’t plant $50,000 in food and not have anywhere to sell it,” she says. “I’m talking to distributors all over the U.S., in the southeast and in bigger cities. There’s a fairly significant food shortage coming, with the California fires and people who work on farms leaving because they’re scared. People are concerned about the price of food.”
These days, she’s working with neighboring Amish farmers. “I tell them I will sell their food and take a cut.” Those neighbors don’t have coolers for food storage, but Red Door does. “I say, ‘I can move your food, and I have a cooler, so bring it to my house and put it in the cooler.’ I feel very responsible to help these folks …  these people need to sell their produce.”
Tenzin Botsford is on the board of directors for Neighbors Place, a Marathon County nonprofit that was established in 1989 by several churches trying to address needs in the community. “They don’t know what to do now, how to make up the difference,” Stacey Botsford says. 
Red Door does cooperate with Cattail Organics, a neighboring farm, to supply farm-to-family food boxes through the Hunger Coalition, operated by United Way in Marathon County. But the past few weeks have been rough. “The seeds are already in the ground for a lot of the producers. We are diverse enough to pivot, but I am concerned with the smaller farms, especially the Hmong farmers in our area who were encouraged to expand, make investments, and put all their trust in this one basket of eggs. My heart is breaking for all the families who will not get the produce and I’m perplexed at how starving the poor of nutrition and gutting the farmers who are producing food is going to propel the country in a positive way. It’s not good on such a big scale.”

By 2050, severe floods that were expected to happen once every 100 years will be three times more likely to occur in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. But the uneven distribution of resources across municipalities leaves some towns less equipped to plan for and respond to disasters.
The post When the river rises appeared first on CommonWealth B[...]","On the eve of July 10, 2023, Piyush Labhsetwar, like many farmers in the Pioneer Valley region of Massachusetts, went to sleep anticipating rain. But he wasn’t prepared for what he saw the next morning, when he checked the online water gauge for the Mill River, a tributary of the Connecticut river that runs along Grow Food Northampton’s 121-acre community farm. “[The] water level was shooting straight up,” he recalled. “This doesn’t look good.” He drove to the farm and found one of the incoming roads blocked by police. The river had jumped its banks and the bridge to cross it was underwater. He found another place to cross. “Part of the farm had turned into the river. And it was not just, you know, still water,” he said. “It was like a flowing river, taking part of the farm.”  On the same day, a man was rescued from his car in a park that the Mill River had overtaken nearby. Six miles north in Williamsburg, Meekin Brook jumped its banks and rushed through the parking lot of O’Brien’s Auto Works. In Greenfield alone,142,290 gallons of untreated sewage were released into the Connecticut and Deerfield Rivers. And culverts and roads were washed out up and down the valley.  That region was hit so hard that season that the Massachusetts State Legislature appropriated $20 million to reimburse farmers for lost revenue and $15 million for municipalities impacted by storms and disasters. Over the past six decades, the Northeast has seen a 60 percent increase in precipitation during the top 1 percent heaviest rain days. By 2050, severe floods that were expected to happen once every 100 years will be three times more likely to occur in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. But the region faces multiple obstacles addressing these unfolding impacts of climate change. Uneven distribution of resources across municipalities leaves some towns less equipped to plan for and respond to disasters — and each town addresses flooding in its own silo, through town-specific comprehensive plans and infrastructure upgrades. Non-profits, planning agencies, and government officials are advocating for more coordination, including ambitious state and federal legislation that would corral the watershed community together. They say that what happens upstream affects those downstream and that everyone needs support.  “You have communities that are trying to deal with this on their own, which I understand, and at the same time, we need to think about it as a full ecosystem,” said Kimberly Robinson, executive director of the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC), the designated regional planning body for 43 cities and towns in Hampden and Hampshire county.  Massachusetts State Senator Jo Comerford echoes the sentiment: “The river has to be seen as an entity in its whole self. … Even as municipalities protect themselves, which of course they have a right to do, … we need a coordinating body to make sure that we’re talking to each other.” Floodplains have been a site of civilization throughout human history. Joseph Graveline, advisor for the Nolumbeka Project, a northeastern tribal heritage preservation organization, points out that for millennia Indigenous people “chose to live by the river, understanding that it would flood from time to time and that they could deal with it quite nicely and move right back onto the land again afterwards.” When the river flooded, it left nutrients and silt in its wake, which was ideal for farming.  “They saw pure organic material coming down the river. Beautiful stuff,” he said.  But colonization and industrialization dramatically changed life along the river, with the first European settlements in the 1600s, the first dam construction in the late 1700s, the industrial revolution in the 1800s, and hydroelectric power and the agricultural revolution in the 1900s. The last four hundred years have led to a new relationship with the river for most people, and with the addition of climate change, what was once manageable has become a liability.  During the July 10 flood, Joe Czajkowski, whose Hadley farm grows 400 acres of fruit and vegetables, lost over $1 million dollars in crops — roughly a quarter of anticipated revenue for that year. This was food that was destined for local schools, universities, and grocery stores. Some of the crops were lost outright, but some were unsellable because they’d made contact with river water, which can expose crops to manure from upstream farms, sewage, agricultural chemicals, fuel, heavy metals, and microbial pathogens, according to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR).“The river has to be seen as an entity in its whole self. … Even as municipalities protect themselves, which of course they have a right to do … we need a coordinating body to make sure that we’re talking to each other.” 
– Massachusetts State Senator Jo ComerfordFour days after the flooding, MDAR issued a guide that “strongly” discouraged farmers from replanting crops that are commonly eaten raw, like salad greens, in river flooded fields within that season.  “Certain crops that live in the soil, like carrots, [we] might have been able to plant over again,” Czajkowski said. “But I didn’t think it would be smart to put them in the soil and try for a second crop or second planting, because who knows what’s in that soil from the flood waters?” Graveline has the same concerns, and questions whether his plan to grow blueberries on his land in Northfield makes sense. During Hurricane Irene, he watched “propane tanks floating down river at the speed of a speed boat,” he said. “I saw refrigerators … just everything you can imagine floating down that river. … We just don’t know what the impact is going to be short term, medium term or long term to these kind[s] of chemicals coming onto the land.” Czajkowski says that even crops out of the river’s way were inundated with rainwater. He lost more than half of his cucurbits — crops like cucumbers, squash, and peppers — to a moisture-loving soil borne pathogen called PCap, Phytophthora capsici. It’s a pernicious disease that thrives in soils saturated with water and causes fruit rot, rapid wilting, and death in many vegetables. Its “swimming spores” can travel a great distance within the soil, contaminating other fields. It also produces long-lived spores that can survive underground for years.  The July 10 flood also came at an unexpected time. Labhsetwar and many others pointed out that historically, flooding in this region is expected in the spring because of snow and ice melt, and the predictability helped. “[Farmers] would not disturb the land or till the land until that happens. So they could plan around it, because it was a more predictable event. But now with climate change, the floods are happening very erratically.” Labhsetwar said 2023 was “a crazy year” at Grow Food Northampton, with two floods in July and an even more surprising one in December. Nearly 60 percent of the state’s agricultural output in the Connecticut River watershed, leaving many concerned about the impact of climate change and its myriad ripple effects, including diseased crops, on food security. The Massachusetts Executive Office of Environment and Affairs (EEA) estimates an 8 percent decline in key commodity crops like barley, corn, cotton, hay, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat by 2030, and a 20 percent decline by 2070.  “Impacts of climate change, whether that is droughts or flooding, have a larger impact on our ability as a Commonwealth to be resilient,” said Robinson. In addition to food security, these weather events take a toll on small businesses, homes, and infrastructure. The 2022 Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment cited “urgent climate impacts” in the Connecticut River watershed, many of which were seen on July 10 and some which are predicted to unfold: damage to inland buildings from heavy rainfall, overwhelmed drainage systems, and a reduced property tax base due to inland flood risk. Todd O’Brien, owner of O’Brien’s Auto Works in Williamsburg, took out a loan to replace over $80,000 in equipment that was damaged when water Meekin Brook forced its way under the door of his garage, as well as through a fissure in the concrete floor, resulting in what he described as a “geyser.” His landlord had to replace the exterior wall that had been holding back the river.  O’Brien said insurance wouldn’t cover his equipment because the flood was “an act of god.”“We [had to] just sweep all that was left from the water and try to put our lives back together,” he said.  Todd O’Brien owns O’Brien’s Auto Works in Williamsburg, MA. In July 2023, O’Brien’s shop was flooded when Meekin Brook, which flows behind his shop, overflowed.  (Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)When Meekin Brook overflowed, it flooded the parking lot and forced its way under the door of Todd O’Brien’s garage.

(Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)In Northampton, an overflowing stream coupled with stormwater on roads led to the pooling of water in a low-lying neighborhood and pushed water into the first floors of single-family homes.  Carolyn Misch, the city’s director of Planning and Sustainability, said that events like the July 10 flood block access points to entire neighborhoods. Even before that summer, her department was concerned about the “people who are most vulnerable and therefore have very tenuous housing situations … [who] might be living in the lowest lying areas,” she said. Planning for climate-related emergencies for those populations is a top priority moving forward.  In November of 2024, a partnership of 16 municipalities, 13 legislators, and two regional planning agencies, including PVPC, sent a letter to EEA Secretary Rebecca Pepper urging the administration to include a $100 million fund dedicated to supporting the watershed’s health and resilience in the forthcoming environmental bond bill.  The letter noted that much of the region’s flood control infrastructure — like the Hatfield Dike — was built in the 1930s and 1940s, and while it has “protected the region from catastrophic flooding” it is “not equal to the ravages of climate change.”  Comerford, one of the letter’s signatories, told CommonWealth Beacon that she hopes the fund can also address the region’s wastewater treatment challenges. “We have many water sewer problems on the Connecticut – aging infrastructure that sends sewage into the river in huge quantities these days,” Comerford told CommonWealth Beacon. “So [we need] everything from flood control to water sewer repair, so that not only is the water not flooding farm fields and municipalities, but when it floods, it’s not then tainted with sewage.”  Robinson, also a signatory, has seen communities struggle under the weight of disaster recovery, including some that have very few paid staff and are “inundated” with calls during weather events.  “[There is] tremendous pressure on local governance,” said Robinson. “All those pressure points became really apparent” during July of 2023, when some communities had no paid staff other than a director of public works, if that, to respond.  Comferford hopes the money would directly go to communities that need to upgrade infrastructure but would also be used to create a coordinating body so that towns are not undermining each other’s efforts.  “If one municipality upstream hardens its infrastructure, puts up a big retaining wall, it’s going to change the river,” she said. “If we do this in Fairfield, what happens to Hadley and Hatfield, or Northampton? … We need that kind of coordination.” In an email to CommonWealth Beacon, Danielle Burney, a spokesperson for EEA said, “The Connecticut River Watershed, along with each of Massachusetts’ rivers, is on the frontlines of climate change, experiencing historic flooding that has devastated farmland, homes, and businesses.” In reference to the $100 million requested in the November 2024 letter, she said “We are currently developing an environmental bond bill to be filed later this spring. We look forward to sharing the significant investments that these critical authorizations will support.” The Connecticut River Partnership, a network of advocacy organizations that includes PVPC and the Connecticut River Conservancy, is also looking to the federal government for support. In July 2023, in response to the partnership’s advocacy, Sen. Jeanne Sheehan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, introduced S.2660, the Connecticut River Partnership Act, to establish a program for coordinating “restoration and protection” activities among federal, tribal, state, local, and regional entities and conservation partners throughout the watershed. (Shaheen’s office along with the Connecticut River Partnership was working on the bill before the flood, but after the devastation the importance of the bill became more apparent, said a staffer.) Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren were two of six co-sponsors, all of whom were Democrats and who represented Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The bill did not make it out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in 2023, but Sen. Sheehan will reintroduce it this legislative cycle, said one of her staffers. The bill was also introduced in the House of Representatives with eight cosponsors, and it did not make it out of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Kimberly Robinson, the executive director of The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, says communities need help to deal with the flooding from the Connecticut River. “We need to think about it as a full ecosystem,” she adds. (Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)While developed before the July 10 flooding, the goals of the bill included creating “water management for volume and flood damage mitigation improvements to benefit fish and wildlife habitat” and advancing “the use of nature-based solutions to maximize the resilience of communities, natural systems, and habitats under changing sea levels, storm risks, and watershed conditions.” In the meantime, cities and towns are doing much of this work on their own with support from grants and groups like PVPC. PVPC has helped 27 municipalities develop Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) plans, which include short- and long-term planning for flood events. Andrew Levine, Hatfield’s town administrator, said a big focus of Hatfield’s plan is “making room for the river,” which, in future flood scenarios, might encroach on the town’s infrastructure and services.  “Our town facilities, much of our infrastructure, and our emergency response departments, are all within the new floodplain, and that creates some risks to us for sure that we’re trying to find ways to mitigate,” said Levine. Until last year, when an engineering team made updated floodplain maps based on preliminary FEMA data and river flow projections by University of Massachusetts, Hatfield only had access to FEMA maps from the 1970s, which do not reflect the river’s new reality under climate change.  Calculated by the engineers, the “new floodplain” is a more accurate representation of the distance the overflow of the river is expected to reach in major flood events. Hatfield’s flood management recommendations are based on scenarios in which much of its town center could be three to four feet under water in a 100-year flood — a flood that has a 1 percent chance of happening in any year.  In addition to long term considerations like moving emergency services, the town hall, and the senior center to higher land, the town plan’s short-term recommendations include inventorying and assessing culverts for upgrades.  “Everything is costly, but so is not mitigating disaster,” said Diana Szynal, chair of the Hatfield select board. Szynal said that as a small town with only a 3-person essentially-volunteer select board, they were grateful to have the support of PVPC in making their plan because “from our perspective … that’s a lot of work.”  Hatfield’s recalculated floodplain includes much of the town’s infrastructure including its emergency response departments, says Andrew Levine, the town’s administrator. (Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)Hatfield is just one town, and not all municipalities have the capacity to create customized forecasts to guide their planning.   “We’ve been cobbling together resources because we don’t have what we need,” said Patty Gambarini, PVPC’s chief environment planner.  Labhsetwar, the pawpaw farmer who since the flood has become the farm and land stewardship manager at Grow Food Northampton, says that accurate maps are also important if you want to site agriculture based on a climate adaptive approach. In 2023, two of the vegetable farms that Grow Food Northampton leased land to were in the lowest lying portion of the property. One farm moved, and Grow Food Northampton decided not to renew the lease of the other. Grow Food Northampton is considering leasing the most vulnerable plots to fruit and nut tree growers.   Another challenge is that some towns are using precipitation data from the 1950’s to inform development projects and aren’t accurately accounting for stormwater runoff – a major factor that affects flooding. In 2023, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection issued new proposed regulations for the Wetlands Protection Act, including a new stormwater handbook that would require municipalities to manage stormwater based on updated precipitation data. MassDEP officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But, according to the agency’s website, changes should be finalized this spring. “Regulation on new development and redevelopment projects need to be accounting for current and potentially future rainfall to reduce risk. And relying on old rainfall data in calculations is no longer suitable,” said Gambarini.  In addition to updating regulations, towns need to be able to review projects to those standards and enforce those regulations. PVPC says this is difficult in itself, given how many towns don’t have professional staff.  “They just don’t have the capacity,” said Ken Comia, PVPC’s deputy director of land use and environment.  Gambarini says that while updated building codes are important, because they ensure that new development takes more responsibility for onsite management of stormwater, one of the most significant things a region can do is protect nature’s pre-existing systems for water absorption, like wetlands.  In a city version of that philosophy, Northampton received funding to look at five different places around the city where they could install green infrastructure, which is a way of mimicking natural processes for managing stormwater. Misch said the goal is to turn hard infrastructure, like paved areas, into “natural flood plains.” Two sites were at schools that would direct stormwater into bioswales to help prevent downstream flooding. The city now has construction designs for these projects and will continue to look for funding to implement them.  During the summer of 2023, Labhsetwar was leasing one third of an acre in the lowest lying portion of the farm. He’d picked that site because he was growing pawpaws — a fruit tree adapted to floodplains — and perennial grains as part of an experiment in resilient agriculture. On July 10, the 5-foot tree tubes were fully under water. But in the following weeks, the baby trees were doing just fine. And he was glad to see that the wheat bounced back the next year. “This is the experiment I planned for,” he’d thought.  He argues that one of the benefits of growing trees in floodplains is that the crop is less likely to be contaminated by river water than low-lying vegetables. But changing a society’s approach to agriculture and to eating habits is “slow work.” “It is like really figuring out what tree crops will work in your land, and also for people to be able to use that kind of food,” he said.  Other slow work is repairing parts of the river that have been impacted by erosion. The Connecticut River Conservancy uses root wad installations to stabilize carved out riverbends, which involves inserting a tree with a big root wad into the riverbank so that the root structure slows down that water. “One of the things humanity has been very good at is building right up to the edge of the water,” said Rebecca Todd, executive director of the Connecticut River Conservancy.  “We’ve all seen those steep creek walls that slump because the river comes whooshing around the corner,” she said. “So what we are trying to do is to revegetate some of the riparian corridors to help stabilize the area.” In the coming weeks, Gambarini will be running a round table through the MVP grant program to engage in conversations across the watershed and “accelerate” what municipalities can accomplish together. The round table will include “flood savvy technical people” from municipalities all along the Connecticut River in Massachusetts.  Comia echoes the importance of applying technical knowledge to planning. “My mantra as an urban planner is building the capacity of the people that are making decisions,“ he said. “At the end of the day, my hope is that [these towns] are making decisions based on the best information that’s out there, even if it is scary.”The post When the river rises appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/970B6467-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Getty Images)I lost my 92 year old mother after a long illness last month. 
My mother passed away peacefully in her home at The Havens, an assisted living facility where she resided for a little more than the last five years of her life. I helped her make the transition from her home to The Havens in December of 2019 immediately prior to the public health emergency of COVID that forever changed life in America. 
Initially reluctant, my mother was persuaded by the 24-hour access to personalized care services. Prior to the move, she began experiencing episodes of uncontrollable blood pressure spikes that landed her repeatedly in the emergency room in the middle of the night. She lived alone and was scared and vulnerable. The on-site personalized care my mother received at The Havens unequivocally extended her life, as well as its quality. The nursing staff were able to monitor and control her blood pressure, eliminating visits to the ER. 
Thanks to the living situation and options available to her, she was able to share more time with me and her granddaughter. 
Unfortunately, the majority of West Virginians cannot afford access to such care. My mother had the foresight — and resources — to purchase long-term care insurance over 20 years ago. She watched the health crises of her mother and siblings and did not want to experience the same fate. 
Today, 76% of nursing homes residents in West Virginia are covered by Medicaid: That’s over 49,000 residents in just one state. Medicare beneficiaries rely on Medicaid for assistance with services not covered by Medicare, particularly long term care. 
There is an unprecedented and unnecessary attack on one of the largest health insurance programs in the country. The GOP has plans to rip Medicaid from our seniors — and every other person assisted by Medicaid — in the current budget process. Under the current proposal, West Virginia stands to lose over a half a billion federal dollars. And we all saw a few weeks ago how eager West Virginia Republicans are to throw tens of thousands of their constituents under the bus if Congress cuts the program. They didn’t even wait for their Congressional delegation. They preempted them by attempting to sneak in a Medicaid trigger bill signaling the message: Hey, it’s OK, we don’t care if you gut Medicaid. We are ready and willing.
The only thing that stopped them was you and all of us. You responded. We showed up. We all said no. And it was not with a whisper but with one concerted voice: Hands off our health care. 
Life according to the GOP is they have theirs — we are on our own to figure out how to pay for health care, irrespective of our age, vulnerabilities or circumstances. 
Do you have a mother or father or grandparent who may soon need assisted living or skilled nursing? The average cost of assisted living in West Virginia is $5,500 per month. The average cost of a semi-private room in a West Virginia skilled nursing facility is $11,619 per month.
Medicaid helps pay for many of these costs. Medicaid provides health care for over 70 million Americans, including 7.2 million seniors. It provides essential coverage for expenses like long-term care, medical equipment, hospitalization, and prescription drugs. As the single largest payer to long-term care services in the country, middle-class families depend on Medicaid to help take care of their loved ones. Six in 10 nursing home residents count on Medicaid for the long-term care they need — that’s 5.6 million older Americans.
West Virginians for Affordable Health Care urges lawmakers to look out for the best interests of their fellow West Virginia residents. We urge you to protect our health care and reject yet another tax cut that only benefits billionaires.

Kentucky’s population grew in 2024, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau estimates. And over 80% of that growth was due to the migration of people from other countries.
The Census makes yearly estimates of population changes at the state and county level. Here are five items to note from the report on 2024:

Kentucky added a net 37,777 people last year, an increase of .8%. At the end of last year, Kentucky had a population of 4,588,372, according to the Census.
Kentucky had more deaths (53,140) than births (52,248) in 2024. That loss was made up by a net increase in domestic migration of 7,294 people. (More people moved into Kentucky from other states than moved out.) 
The largest contributor to Kentucky’s population growth was international migration. The state gained 31,430 people in the net exchange of people between Kentucky and other countries. Over 80% of the net gain in Kentucky’s population came from international migration.
 Of Kentucky’s 120 counties, 37 lost population in 2024. A large number of these are places that have been dependent on coal mining.
The state’s two largest counties (Jefferson and Fayette) both had decreases in domestic migration, but gained population overall because of international migration. For example, Jefferson lost just over 4,600 people to domestic migration, but gained 13,807 people from other counties. (Counties surrounding these two metro counties gained from domestic migration; some of that growth likely came from moving out of the large metro counties.)

The 2024 report is a snapshot of population trends. And in many ways, Kentucky is like the rest of the nation. For example, most of the population growth in the U.S. in 2024 was due to international migration.

Nonmetropolitan, or rural, counties grew by 134,000 residents between 2023 and 2024, reversing a decade-long trend of population decline that happened between 2010 and 2020. Since […]","While the South grew the most in absolute numbers of rural population, the largest percentage growth was in the Interior Northwest, made up of Idaho, Wyoming and Montana.

(Photo courtesy of Bill Schneider/Daily Montanan)Thousands of people moved to rural America last year, causing the fourth year of continual growth in rural areas, according to a Daily Yonder analysis of 2024 Census estimates.
Nonmetropolitan, or rural, counties grew by 134,000 residents between 2023 and 2024, reversing a decade-long trend of population decline that happened between 2010 and 2020.
Since 2020, in-migration has been the primary force behind rural population gain. If it wasn’t for people moving to rural America, nonmetro counties would have lost more than half a million residents over the past four years.
That’s because deaths have been outnumbering births in rural places, a phenomenon demographers refer to as natural decrease. (Natural increase, on the other hand, occurs when births outnumber deaths).
Between 2023 and 2024, rural America lost 104,600 residents to natural decrease. But because the number of people who moved to rural counties was greater than the number of people who left, rural America saw a net migration of 240,000 residents.
(Nonmetropolitan, or rural, counties in this analysis are the counties not on the list of metropolitan areas in the 2013 Office of Management and Budget database.)
A similar trend occurred in smaller metropolitan areas. Metro counties with populations fewer than 250,000, referred to simply as small metros in the table below, lost just over 2,000 residents to natural decrease in 2024. These counties, however, also gained an additional 226,200 residents by people moving in.
In medium-sized suburbs of cities with populations between 250,000 and 1 million, natural decrease resulted in a drop of 10,300 residents. But in-migration added 203,600 residents to those counties, resulting in a net gain of 193,100 residents in 2024.
But in the nation’s largest counties, population growth happened through a combination of both natural increase and in-migration. In the major metros with populations exceeding 1 million residents, both natural change and positive net migration resulted in a growth of almost 1 million residents. The suburbs of those cities gained about 1.2 million, primarily through migration.
In medium-sized metros, or cities with populations between 250,000 and 1 million, increases in migration and births resulted in a net gain of more than half a million more residents.
 The South as epicenter of rural growth

In 2024, America gained population across every type of geography, from the nation’s largest cities to the countryside’s smallest towns. But that growth was more pronounced in some regions over others.
About two-thirds of the national rural population growth happened in the South, for example. Home to nearly 18 million rural residents in 2024, the South is the largest region in the United States in terms of population size, so it follows that the most drastic fluctuations in raw numbers happened there.
Like the rest of rural America, population growth in the South was a direct result of people moving in. The South gained an additional 130,100 residents in 2024.
Simultaneously, these counties lost 41,800 residents through natural decrease. The resulting net change in population in the rural South was a growth of 88,200 people.
In terms of percent change, however, the largest growth last year happened in the Interior Northwest. Between 2023 and 2024, the Interior Northwest, which includes the states of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, grew by 12,000 residents, a 0.68% increase.
Population growth in the Interior Northwest happened because of a mix of natural increase and migration. In-migration accounted for an additional 10,000 residents, while natural change resulted in about 2,000 new residents.
The Mid Atlantic region, which includes states like Virginia, Delaware, and Maryland, among others, was the only region that saw rural population declines in 2024. But that decrease was relatively minor–about 3,100 residents, a 0.07% drop since 2023.

Relations between tenant groups and Housing Authority of Winston-Salem (HAWS) Executive Director Kevin Chesire have deteriorated to the point where group leaders are demanding the HAWS Board of Commissioners fire Chesire.
Tenants complain that Chesire is inattentive to their concerns and has failed to maintain safe and sanitary housing at the two apartment complexes and other buildings managed by HAWS.

“I want to see Kevin Chesire resign,” said Michael Douglas, president of Crystal Towers United, a tenants’ group. “He is very arrogant about his position. He cares about optics, but he doesn’t care about what we [tenants] see.”
When asked about the demands that he be fired, Chesire said, “The mayor appoints the [HAWS] board [of commissioners] and the board decides whether to employ me.”
“We can’t even get our toilets to work right”
Tenants at both Crystal Towers and Healy Towers have long lists of grievances. At Crystal Towers, residents complain about leaky plumbing, mold and mildew. At Healy Towers, bed bug infestations and other pests are concerns. Balky elevators at Crystal Towers were replaced but had been a major concern for the mostly disabled and elderly residents who live in the 11-story building.
At a protest rally earlier this month, Healy Towers resident Edith Chisholm, took issue with HAWS spending money to refurbish the King building on North Cleveland Avenue to serve as its headquarters. The building, on Sixth Street, is a short walk across a parking lot from Crystal Towers. It replaced space the housing authority occupied downtown.
“[HAWS] refurbished a building for themselves, and we can’t even get our toilets to work right,” Chisholm said. “We can’t even get bed bugs out.”

Chisholm was part of a large crowd that gathered outside of the King building to demand HAWS fire Chesire and make repairs to Crystal Towers and other public housing facilities.
MeKaann Evans, a public housing resident and member of Housing Justice Now, a housing advocacy group, said faulty plumbing is a primary concern for Crystal Towers residents.
“The water goes through the walls and there’s always puddles of water on the floor,” Evans said in an interview with NC Newsline just ahead of the tenants’ rally. “They also need to go in and kill this mold instead of painting over it because, as we know, you can die from mold. Mold is serious and a lot of elderly people in this building already have breathing issues.”
Board backs the executive director 
The HAWS Board of Commissioners’ monthly meeting was held on the day of the tenants’ rally. Crystal Towers and the rally outside were main topics.
The commissioners’ support for Chesire appeared solid as he guided them through a presentation about the state of the city’s public housing communities. He’d made a similar presentation to the Winston-Salem City Council in March.
Chesire explained that Winston-Salem, like cities across the country, is struggling to figure out how to maintain outdated high rise public housing buildings. Crystal Towers and other older buildings managed by HAWS are in desperate need of modernization, Chesire said. And even after modernization, such facilities would not be optimal for disabled and elderly residents, he said.

“This is not an issue that has snuck upon us nationally but needing modernization is a lot different than what has been described to the [city] council and what I’m presuming is being described out in front of this building today,” Chesire said. “Needing modernization is different than suggesting that our maintenance team, who I’m extremely proud of, is ignoring work orders and is not fixing what is broken.”
Chesire was more succinct during the March city council meeting, where residents shared concerns with the council.
“I categorically reject allegations of plumbing system failures, defective work order system, non-responsiveness of management or maintenance staff, and we certainly categorically reject accusations that nothing has been done,” he said.
Chesire noted that HAWS spent $607,000 on maintenance on Crystal Towers in 2024. He said that of 108 plumbing work orders received so far this year, 94 closed within 24 hours, most within same day. Across the city’s public housing, Chesire said HAWS received and closed 1,712 maintenance work orders entered by residents in 2024.
Advocacy group backs tenants
Dan Rose, a House Justice Now member, contends that there are serious plumbing concerns at Crystal Towers. Rose and tenants have asked the city council for money to make needed repairs. He said the city made a promise to make the repairs in 2022 when tenants successfully fought against the building being sold.
“The residents want their plumbing issues addressed first because of the mold, because of the mildew,” Rose said in an interview with NC Newsline. “We know that these outdated pipes leaking inside their walls and ceilings are making them sick.”

Rose acknowledges that the housing authority has made improvements to the elevators at Crystal Towers but says little else has been done to address residents’ concerns.
“They’ve just done a lot of cosmetic stuff down in the lobby and put in some new elevators, which is important but not the only thing,” Rose said. “The residents have decided they want plumbing to happen first, because again, it’s making them sick, and they know it.”
Tensions between tenants and officials who manage public housing properties are not unusual, housing authority officials and tenants agree.
They also agree that conflicts are inevitable when tenants feel unheard, unseen and believe critical property repairs come too slowly or are never made. And when federal underfunding, competition for scarce resources and other impediments prevent housing authorities from meeting tenants’ needs, the outcome can be chaotic, they say.
Still, in Winston-Salem, the ongoing tension between public housing residents and housing authority officials can sometimes feel next level.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if residents were this angry everywhere,” Rose said. “I don’t mean to toot our [Housing Justice Now] horn too loudly but I do think that it’s [the tension] very much a result of our organizing efforts.”
Chesire and his critics are in agreement. “I think the unique situation here is the involvement of Dan Rose with Housing Justice Now and his strategic utilization of media,” Chesire said. “You typically don’t have an outside group that is attempting to direct the message the way that we have here.”
Tragic death spurs tenant safety demands
Tragedy struck Crystal Towers on Jan. 25. A second story fire led to the hospitalization of tenant Abraham Woods, who died Feb. 1. Woods lived across the hall from the apartment that caught fire due to a cooking incident. Triad City Beat reported that Woods died due to cardiopulmonary arrest as well as diffuse hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, which is brain damage that can occur due to carbon monoxide poisoning from smoke inhalation.

Daniel Woods, Mr. Abraham’s nephew, was one of the protesters outside of HAWS’ headquarters on April 8. Woods said the family wants to prevent others from suffering the same fate as Mr. Abraham Woods.
“We’re still feeling the loss, that’s why we’re out here,” said Daniel Woods, who described Mr. Abraham Woods as a gentle giant and beloved family member and tenant at Crystal Towers.
Daniels Woods told NC Newsline that his uncle had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and that the family believes smoke inhalation contributed to his death.
Chesire shared details of the fire with HAWS commissioners during the board’s monthly meeting.
“The fire was small, it was not a smoke billowing out the window situation,” Chesire said. “It was so small that it didn’t even meet our [insurance] deductible.”
Chesire said that Woods evacuated the building under his own power. Once he got outside, he had a “medical event” and collapsed and was rushed to the hospital where he died a week later, Chesire said.
“I’ve seen nothing from any medical professional that attributes the cause of death to smoke inhalation,” Chesire said. “I’m not suggesting that was not a contributing factor, I’m simply reporting to you all that that was not identified on the death certificate as a causation of the death.”
In recent months, Woods’ death has been a point of contention between Crystal Towers residents and HAWS. The residents say they have safety concerns because the housing authority doesn’t provide fire extinguishers in apartments, which the tenants say leaves them vulnerable to fires.
Fire extinguishers are available at each end of hallways, they acknowledge.
“When we asked for fire extinguishers, they refused to give them to us,” said Douglas, the Crystal Towers United president. “And then they said, ‘if we gave them to you, you wouldn’t know how to use them.’”
Instead of fire extinguishers, the housing authority installed stovetop fire stops that are designed to extinguish gas fires on stove tops. The devices work by automatically releasing a fine, dry powder that smothers the fire. Both Douglas and Rose say the devices were out of date when installed.
Douglas, who was passed over for an opening on the HAWS board, said HAWS denied Crystal Towers tenants’ request for emergency evacuation chairs to help disabled tenants get downstairs in case elevators stopped working during a fire.
“The elevators are constantly out-of-order,” Douglas said. “They refused to buy us any of those [emergency evacuation] chairs. We’ve got people in wheelchairs. You can put them in those chairs and take them down the steps because when we have a fire, they cut the elevators off.”
Chesire addressed the request for evacuation chairs during the board of commissioners meeting. He said the housing authority retains a list of residents who need help being evacuated during emergencies. The list is shared with first responders so they can assist them, he said.
“We can’t have other residents or staff physically moving people,” Chesire said. “It’s a liability issue, it’s a potential injury issue, so we’ve got to wait on first responders.”
Douglas sees it differently.
“They treat us like second class citizens,” he said. “They make decisions on stuff that affect us but never take our thoughts into consideration.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4225-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 06:07:31.228370

(mikroman6 via Getty Images)In 18th century France, the Bastille came to represent the malignancy of the monarchy.
Built as a fortress in Paris, the imposing structure had become under the Bourbon kings a state prison to which a capricious royal authority could disappear disfavored residents without warning or due process.
Some of the detainees had committed no offense other than to express views the king deemed seditious or dangerous. The conditions were squalid. Many prisoners were stripped of their ability to communicate with anyone on the outside.
The Bastille symbolized all that was inhumane, repressive and rotten in the reign of Louis XVI, which is why it was a primary target, both in principle and practice, of the liberty-minded revolutionaries who crushed the monarchy and remade French government and society.
An Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Colorado is reminiscent of the Bastille. The center is a regional analog, and its remit is narrower than was its French counterpart’s. But, under the Trump administration, its purpose is no less emblematic of the cruel and arbitrary whims of a despot, and it operates equally as an intolerable trespass on the people’s conscience.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Known formally by ICE as the Denver Contract Detention Facility, the center is located on Oakland Street in Aurora. It’s run by a profit-making private contractor, The GEO Group.
Immigration rights advocates have long alleged that living conditions at the center are deplorable and that detainees are mistreated.
“I think that a lot of the strategy that they have there in that detention center is to try to make the living conditions so bad that you will want to deport yourself and not wait for the legal process. They’re not focused on treating them in a humane way,” the brother of a detainee told researchers in 2023.
Also that year, immigration rights groups filed a complaint with federal authorities, urging them to investigate reported misuse of solitary confinement at the center. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, who represents the center’s district, became so alarmed by disturbing accounts of poor conditions at the center that he undertook his own oversight actions. 
He has encountered resistance to transparency from ICE at every turn, but he managed at least to extract bare-minimum information about the place. During an in-person inspection in March, he reported that 1,243 detainees were confined there and that they were mostly from Mexico, India and Venezuela.
The ICE detention center is hardly the only place designed to lock away human beings that has faced complaints about poor living conditions. It took the rogue immigration enforcement policies of the second Trump administration to make the center singularly eligible for comparison to its French antecedent.
The center is one of several sites around the country where immigration enforcement authorities have sent hundreds of immigrants, often without any warning, meaningful due process or transparency. These facilities are becoming black sites where constitutional values are exchanged for MAGA depravity and lawlessness.
In March, ICE agents arrested longtime Denver resident Jeanette Vizguerra during her break at work at Target, and she’s been detained and awaiting deportation at the Aurora detention center ever since. Federal authorities claim the Mexican national is subject to a removal order from more than a decade ago, but her lawyers dispute the premise of her detention. They have persuasively argued in federal court that she was targeted solely for her vocal support — constitutionally protected speech — for immigration rights. In other words, she expressed views that America’s aspiring king deems dangerous, and his henchmen caged her for it.
Two other Aurora detainees, both asylum seekers who have not been charged with any crime, filed a lawsuit in federal court saying they fear they could be deported. Authorities allege the men have ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, but not only do both men reject that charge, one of them fled Venezuela after TdA members murdered his wife’s father and uncle.
A lawyer for the two men told reporters this week that more than 100 people detained in Aurora, including his clients, are at risk of being deported under President Donald Trump’s March invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that has been used on only three previous occasions and only during war.
These detainees are afforded limited communication to people beyond the prison walls, face unlawful deportations, and are being deprived of meaningful due process.
Worse, the lawyer said that at least 11 people who were detained in Aurora have already been removed to the brutal CECOT prison in El Salvador. That’s the prison where U.S. authorities, who proudly refuse to do anything to reverse their error, mistakenly sent Maryland resident Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, as well as hundreds of others.
The Aurora detention center symbolizes all that is inhumane, repressive and rotten about the Trump administration, and Coloradans who want to preserve democracy and the rule of law cannot abide its presence in the state. 
The most celebrated day of the French Revolution is July 14, 1789. That’s when residents of Paris stormed the Bastille, marking the end of this symbol of government tyranny. The date is now a French national holiday. The attack on the prison involved reckless violence that in no way should be emulated. But what is admirable about the event is the people’s courageous defiance of grave government abuses. 
American institutions have utterly failed to shield Americans from the Trumpist sewage of corruption and unchecked power, which more than any other site in Colorado the Aurora detention center exemplifies.

This remembrance of Tom Bethell was published this week in The Mountain Eagle, a weekly newspaper based in Whitesburg widely respected for its coverage of the coal industry, education and politics, and for bringing national attention to environmental and other injustices in Kentucky’s mountains.			


When the Scotia mine in Letcher County exploded twice in March of 1976, Mountain Eagle reporters spread out to interview miners, recovery workers and others, gathering facts and chasing down rumors. Fortunately for them (and readers everywhere), Tom Bethell, then research director for the United Mine Workers, had dropped everything and was standing by in Whitesburg to turn their raw material into a seamless, compelling narrative.
Pecking away on a typewriter with only one finger at a speed that shamed the best touch typist, Bethell, who died peacefully on April 10 in Washington, D.C., at the age of 86, shaped stories in that week’s Eagle that gave a complete account of the disaster and all the mistakes that led to it. 
Tom Bethell was no stranger to the Eagle or coal miners. A contributor to The Mountain Eagle for six decades, he dedicated his extraordinary investigative, writing, photographic, and analytic skills to demand justice for coal miners and Appalachia.
“Tom was a prince of a man, a saint in the too small world of advocacy journalism on behalf of those who carry an unequal share of our nation’s burdens,” said longtime Eagle contributor Jim Branscome.  “Tom’s persistence in demanding justice for coal miners and the mountains has few equals. Coal miners and the cause of mine safety never had a better friend.”
Thomas N. Bethell was born on Feb. 8, 1939, in Beverly, Massachusetts. The youngest of three siblings, he attended but did not graduate from Harvard University, possibly expelled (the story goes) for dropping a typewriter from three stories to see if it would bounce. 
In 1962, he began a series of editing jobs, the first of which, for Boston publisher Houghton Mifflin, brought him to Whitesburg; a year later, he began to write for the Eagle, beginning his long and powerful advocacy for Appalachia and its people. 
In 1967, Bethell became information officer for Appalachian Volunteers (AVs), a federally funded anti-poverty program. Unlike many “poverty warriors” who came to the mountains with their own preconceptions and agendas, Bethell would listen and learn, said Sue Ella Kobak, a Pike County native whom Bethell befriended in the 1960s. “He was so much more aware of who he was within Appalachia, why he was there, and the limits placed on him in that place.”
Mike Clark, whom Bethell hired as an Appalachian Volunteer shortly after the two met on a Knott County strip mine in 1967, quickly learned that Bethell was a fast study — and driver. “Tom had a unique ability to put interviewees at ease while talking about death and injury in the mines,” Clark said. “As a journalist dealing with hard reality, such as mine disasters, black lung, and the bleakness of poverty, greed and murder, he never lost his capacity to find hope in ordinary people. He was the finest journalist I ever had the pleasure of working with and he taught me enormously how to use ordinary words to tell complicated stories with clarity, passion and accuracy.”
For all his serious work, Bethell never lost his great sense of humor, sharp wit, and zest for life. “He traveled across the mountains in a succession of small fast cars that he drove at high speed, often challenging coal trucks on narrow, potted roads,” Clark said. “He loved classical and rock music and had an ability to make up and sing songs at full volume while rocking at high speed.” 
Filling the Eagle nest
Bethell and Clark resigned from the AVs to protest the anti-poverty organization’s firing of draft resister Joe Mulloy. At Bethell’s urging, Clark went to work with the Eagle, whose publishers, Tom and Pat Gish, were the go-to sources for information, inspiration, and couches to sleep on for countless people from and interested in Central Appalachia. 
Bethell became the Gishes’ lifelong friend and partner, often finding reporters for their always screaming but struggling weekly. Phil Primack was one of many recruited by Tom into the Eagle Aid Society.
  Tom Bethell, right, is seen in this photo taken a short time before longtime Mountain Eagle editor and publisher Tom Gish died after four decades of fighting heart disease. Gish was never happier — or more surprised — than on the evening when Bethell arrived in Whitesburg with this plaque praising him for his decades of speaking truth to power. Many of the individuals who thought of the idea for the honor and financed its production are responsible for the compilation of memories of Bethell that appear in this article. (The Mountain Eagle)
“I had visited eastern Kentucky while still in college near Boston,” said Primack. “In 1969, I was steered to Tom Bethell, who at the time was helping to launch the weekly Boston Phoenix. He in turn steered me to Tom and Pat. Instead of accepting job offers from some big daily papers, I went to work for the Eagle in 1970. I thank Tom Bethell for keeping me off a much more boring career ladder.”
Another Bethell recruit to The Eagle was Lauran Emerson, whom Bethell had literally rescued in October 1968, after she was badly hurt in a motorcycle accident. “Tom answered an emergency call from his friend Bill Wells and set out for the mortuary/clinic in Paintsville, Kentucky, where I had been delivered after the wreck,” said Emerson. “Tom raced his old VW station wagon over the mountains, and they loaded me into it and we headed for the hospital in Huntington, West Virginia. I remember nothing of that trip, but Tom never forgot the police escort that met us at the state line and sped him to the hospital. For once, the cops were leading him instead of chasing him.” 
It was the beginning of another lifelong connection. “First Tom saved my life, then a few years later he introduced me to a whole new one when he asked me to take a detour on a trip west to ‘help out for a few days’ at a little newspaper in Whitesburg, Kentucky. The days became years, and the Gish family became family forever. The Mountain Eagle taught me what real journalism was.”
Writing for the Eagle meant covering mine disasters, strip mine destruction, and other heavy topics. Bethell was always available to not only help synthesize and navigate such difficult issues, but “to lift the mood in the newsroom” every time he visited, said Sallie Bright, who worked for the paper in 1972. “Tom teased everyone, cracked jokes, and generally created an atmosphere of fun. And yet he was very serious about his mission to keep the coal companies in check and to champion the residents of the coalfields.”
Typewriter power
Bethell pursued that mission with a steady stream of always insightful, always perfectly written pieces in the Eagle and beyond.  “Conspiracy in Coal,” which appeared in The Washington Monthly in March 1969, exposed collusion between the United Mine Workers and Consolidation Coal Co., the owner of the Mountaineer No. 9 mine in Mannington, West Virginia which blew up on Nov. 20, 1968, killing 78 men. Bethell was driven by his outrage at the response to the disaster by then-UMW President Tony Boyle, who called Consol “one of the better companies to work with.”

Another Bethell article, “The Pittston Mentality,” drew a straight line from the manmade Buffalo Creek flood in 1972 in West Virginia, which killed 125 people and destroyed 4,000 homes, to the New York City board room of the Pittston Coal Company, whose decisions he showed to be directly responsible for the disaster.
 
In 1970, Bethell created Appalachia Information, becoming a one-man operation doing Herculean work, writing about “coal-related developments in labor, industry and government” in Coal Patrol, his monthly newsletter. 
“Coal Patrol took Washington’s twisted political tales and stripped out the nonsense to get to the heart of the matter,” said Davitt McAteer, who has long worked to improve safety and health, especially for miners, including as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor for the Mine Safety and Health Administration. “Tom’s book, ‘The Hurricane Creek Massacre,’ about the 1970 coal mine explosion near Hyden, Kentucky, was described by Ben Franklin of the New York Times as ‘one of the best pieces of angry journalism I’ve ever read.’”
In 1980, Bethell developed The Miners Manual to help miners understand their protections under the law. “He turned convoluted federal rules and regulations into logical, simple, easily understood passages,” said McAteer. “Tom had an exceptional ability to make complex topics easily understood by everyone.”
Longtime Eagle contributor Bill Bishop recalled how Bethell made himself available when Jim Garland, who was a miner, organizer and folk singer during the Bloody Harlan County union wars of the early 1930s, was trying to get his memoir published by the University Press of Kentucky. “Editors wanted an introduction that would put Garland’s story in context,” Bishop said. “Again, it was Tom to the rescue. Using his knowledge of union history and the Kentucky coalfields, Tom wrote the perfect essay – and Garland’s story, ’Welcome the Traveler Home,’ was published.”
Keeping alive the New Deal
Bethell’s journalistic advocacy and skills weren’t limited to coal.
In the late 1980s, as policymakers debated ways to engage young Americans in public service, he played a quiet but crucial role in reviving an old idea: a national youth conservation corps. Bethell, then an editor at The Washington Monthly, made the case for that revival in a 1988 article titled “The Conservation Corps: A New Beginning?” Drawing inspiration from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps, he argued that a new version could tackle youth unemployment while restoring parks, forests, and public lands.
His piece caught the attention of congressional policymakers, who worked with Bethell to draft legislation supporting a youth service initiative. Their efforts contributed to the National and Community Service Act of 1990, which expanded federal support for conservation jobs and later influenced programs like AmeriCorps. His advocacy, rooted in New Deal-era ideals, helped lay the groundwork for what would become the modern Youth Conservation Corps, a program that continues to employ thousands of young people in environmental stewardship today.
“It wasn’t about nostalgia for the New Deal,” Bethell once said. “It was about what still worked.”
Similarly, Bethell’s work on Social Security stands as a testament to his unwavering commitment to protecting and strengthening one of America’s most vital social programs. As a close collaborator of Robert M. Ball, the former Social Security commissioner and one of the program’s principal architects, Bethell played a key role in shaping the discourse around its solvency and fairness. His work, which included co-authoring several influential reports and serving as a senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance, emphasized maintaining the program’s integrity while addressing modern challenges.
Through his thoughtful analysis and principled stance, Bethell left an enduring legacy in the fight to preserve Social Security as a cornerstone of economic security for generations to come, an especially urgent challenge today.
Tom Bethell leaves behind his wife, Katharine Joyner Bethell, stepdaughter Lydia Joyner, stepson Thomas McAvity III, and step-grandson Simon McAvity. He also leaves two older siblings in Massachusetts and Vermont.
In his final column for Coal Patrol, Bethell wrote a tribute to Ward Sinclair of the Louisville Courier-Journal, a friend of both Bethell and Appalachia. “It’s time to confess in public that I have stolen shamelessly from Ward’s files and stories over the past couple of years, getting away with it only because he is the most self-effacing of reporters and, fortunately, the finest of friends,” Bethell wrote.
Self-effacing and finest of friends. Amen, brother.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tnb-1024x663.jpg,,,2025-04-24 06:07:31.228370

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Loudoun County’s elections office hosted an open house Wednesday, one of several localities inviting voters behind the scenes to learn more about the election process and combat disinformation about ballot security and election integrity as Virginia prepares for high stakes state and local elections in November.
Colleen Regan, a Loudoun County voter and former election worker of five years, said she was impressed with the presentations at the event, calling it “an ideal example of being transparent about how our voting system works.”
Americans have waded through a flood of disinformation about the election process and political candidates for the past five years, a trend that ramped up with then-presidential candidate Donald Trump’s repeated false claims that he, not Joe Biden, won the 2020 presidential election. 
Election officials nationwide also encountered attacks, threats and harassment about election security, including in Buckingham County, Virginia, where in 2023 the county’s registrar and election staff resigned due to relentless, and baseless, allegations of voter fraud.
“There are some people who are so entrenched in their belief systems that they cannot be swayed even by getting behind the scenes,” said Alicia Slook, a Democrat and an election officer in Loudoun County, whose goal is to educate voters and increase transparency about how the election process works.
“Openness and transparency is what it’s all about,” said state Del. Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun, “So when people can go in and look at the system and kick the tires and see how it works, then it removes, potentially, some of the misunderstandings or things that somebody might have questions about. It’s good to open the doors and let folks come in and see how the whole thing works.”
Virginians will elect the next governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, House of Delegates members and local officers in November, many of whom will first face primaries. Early voting for primary elections begins May 2. 
 ‘Come in and have a look’

Loudoun County Office of Elections’ Wednesday open house was the first part of a two-day event giving the public a bird’s eye view of the many processes that unfold during an election cycle, the security of Virginia’s election technology and what happens after an election.
Loudoun’s open house also included details on how the office prepares and trains election officers and uses technology to help people to vote, and how the office reports election results. 
“We want to show our community through transparency, what actually goes on during an election and all of the details that go into putting on an election,” said Samatha Alfaro, communication manager for the Loudoun County Office of Elections.
Slook said the average voter doesn’t see the time spent testing equipment and the measures employed to ensure security, which makes the extra effort to host the open house worth it.
“The office doesn’t have to do this. This is more work for them, but they are doing it because they know there’s nothing to see here, and they want that to be clear to the public,” Slook said. “This is your process. Come in and have a look at it.”

Regan, the former election worker who participated in Loudoun’s open house, said the office did well in breaking down the complexities of elections operations into “bite sized pieces.” She encouraged other voters to take advantage of similar opportunities across the commonwealth to help increase their knowledge and confidence of the election process.
Democratic state Dels. David Reid and Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, all from Loudoun, and other leaders attended Wednesday’s open house. The two state lawmakers all serve on their respective election committees in the General Assembly.
Although this is the first time the county is hosting an open house for voters, this is not the first time it has hosted guests.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin visited Loudoun’s elections office for logic and accuracy testing two years ago, which shed light on the security of the office’s election technology.
 Prince William’s successful pilot

Prince William’s elections office hosted its first open house last year, an event so popular that the office ran out of available visitor slots, elections director Eric Olsen said. 
Open houses are a great way to give the public more information about the electoral process, Olsen said, instead of them getting their information through 15-second video clips on social media.
“I think we have an obligation to provide those opportunities for people. I think it’s a little bit of a recognition of where we are as a society and how we learn about things, and needing to do more beyond the information that’s just kind of provided to us through our phones or through an algorithm that looks at what we always look at,” Olsen added.
Reassuring voters about the security, accuracy and fairness of the process was also a timely response to voter fraud allegations against the county registrar, lobbied by Attorney General Jason Miyares’ Election Integrity Unity in 2024. 
In a lawsuit, Miyares’ office claimed former county registrar Michele White was tampering with votes, WVTF reported. However the case was dropped because a key witness against White said the evidence used to show White’s alleged malfeasance was flawed and her actions were in line regular vote maintenance.
White is suing the attorney general’s office.
Last week, the Prince William elections office won its first award from the Election Assistance Commission’s (EAC) Annual Clearinghouse for innovative practices in election administration for posting the results tapes online. The tapes provide the overall election results, which contain vote tallies for every candidate in every race, and votes on ballot initiatives.
Olsen said the award represents the office’s commitment to transparency and “providing an excellent voting experience for PWC voters.”
He told Mercury that his office is planning a second open house after the event’s success last year.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)PETERSBURG – Vernon Johns Middle School eighth grader Jonathan Phillips already knows he’s interested in a career in physics. With his interest in science, he was especially happy to witness the unveiling of his school’s new medical-focused classroom on Wednesday, a space made possible through a unique partnership between a Virginia health care system, an education nonprofit and Petersburg Public Schools. 
“It seems like a very interesting learning opportunity,” he said.
Phillips was one of a handful of middle school students to attend a formal ribbon cutting for the classroom opening where they  were able to physically interact with various medical instruments and models. As he lingered near a model used for CPR practice, he noted how he’d taken a course and was excited at the prospect of “brushing up” on the life skill. Some other students expressed interest in phlebotamy, the specialty of drawing blood for testing or delivering intravenous medicines, while exploring the room.
Phillips said the classroom may stir up his classmates’ curiosity about working in medical fields. 
“I think some other people might have their interest piqued,” he said. 
Petersburg superintendent Yolanda Brown said that the lab will be part of Vernon Johns Middle School’s “career investigation” courses, offering hands-on experience that will encourage students to further their studies in health care. The school also aims to include guest lecturers in the classroom from different healthcare specialties.
Next door, Petersburg High School,offers a curriculum for certified nursing assistant career paths, which students could explore and plan to pursue or that might inspire interest in other medical professions. As Virginia mirrors national trends in a shortage of workers for critical health professions like various types of nurses and primary care providers, Petersburg’s new medical classroom can help inspire future professionals who could stem the tide. 
“We thought that starting early, at least at middle school, introducing them to those careers, those tracks and what they might need for their ninth grade start of high school, would be a place to start,” said Communities in Schools Petersburg president Wanda Stewart. 
Stewart’s organization is part of a national nonprofit dedicated to supporting local schools and students around the country. Communities in Schools Petersburg facilitated conversations with HCA Virginia Health System and the school division that led to a $25,000 grant that helped set up the classroom. 
“We are excited about our students being able to learn in a way that is a little different from just normal classroom settings,” Stewart  said.
HCA awarded the grant to the school in order to inspire future health care workers, HCA associate vice president of academic affairs Yvette Dorsey explained at the unveiling.
A CPR training for students at Petersburg High added to the health-related learning Wednesday morning. The training stemmed from a collaboration between Petersburg schools, the local emergency services and health departments, and HCA. 
With new state laws requiring public elementary and secondary schools to develop cardiac emergency response plans, the training was timely. The legislation was carried by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virignia Beach, in this year’s General Assembly session and, after passing the legislature, was signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin March 24.

(Courtesy Richmond Metropolitan Habitat for Humanity)What if I told you that the most powerful force in your community isn’t money, politics, or policy — but people? 
Ordinary people. Your neighbors. Folks who pick up a hammer, serve meals, coach Little League, or simply show up when someone needs a hand. They don’t do it for recognition or a paycheck. They do it because something deep inside them says, “I want to help.” That’s the quiet, powerful heartbeat of volunteerism in Virginia.
Volunteerism is a pure expression of care for others. In a world that too often feels driven by fear and scarcity, volunteering reminds us that abundance still exists — in kindness, generosity and the belief that we are responsible for each other.
April 20-26 marks National Volunteer Week, first established by presidential proclamation in 1974. This week offers an opportunity to shine a light on those everyday heroes who give their time, skills and hearts to build stronger, healthier, more connected communities.
And their impact? It’s extraordinary. According to the latest research from AmeriCorps and the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 75 million people formally volunteered in the United States in 2023, giving over 4.9 billion service hours. These efforts equate to $167.2 billion of economic value. 
Here at Richmond Metropolitan Habitat for Humanity, we know the power of volunteers firsthand. In 2024, 2,189 individuals gave their time and talents to help us build homes, communities, and hope. Together, they logged 34,061 service hours — a $1.1 million investment back into the Greater Richmond area.
This incredible impact is captured in the experiences of those who give back to their neighbors. Take Bill Burch of Henrico County, who has volunteered with Richmond Habitat for over 20 years, primarily on build sites. Bill is there for all phases of a house build involving volunteers. He enjoys working with others and often comments on the friendships he’s made with fellow volunteers. Interacting with others and developing relationships are important benefits of service.

Bill says he finds deep meaning from being able to look back and see something tangible that he’s accomplished after a day of volunteering. The most memorable moments for him – and a great many Habitat volunteers and staff – are home dedications, when all who contributed gather to celebrate the home’s completion and present the keys to the family that just purchased it through Habitat’s affordable homeownership program. It’s a moment that underscores the dignity and empowerment of owning a safe, stable, affordable home. 
That deep sense of connection is common among volunteers. Before joining Richmond Habitat earlier this year, I served in various roles with Habitat organizations in California and Illinois. My own Habitat journey began more than three decades ago as a volunteer. Over the years, I’ve witnessed the remarkable impact of volunteerism firsthand — from build sites in Long Beach to board rooms in Chicago, from house dedications in small towns to volunteer orientations in bustling cities. No matter the location, the spirit of service and the strength of community were always the same.
And here’s the beautiful thing: Volunteering doesn’t just benefit communities. It benefits volunteers too.
First, research shows that volunteering is good for your health. Doing joyful work provides a sense of purpose and satisfaction. Volunteers feel more engaged with their communities and are generally happier because service yields fulfillment that boosts mood. The Mayo Clinic reports that volunteers often experience reduced stress and lower mortality rates.
Second, volunteering builds connections. As Bill noted, the friendships he’s formed are among the most enduring benefits of service. Volunteering fosters camaraderie and shared values. These experiences help us develop relationships and see ourselves in others. I’ve even known married couples who met on volunteer sites.
Third, volunteering helps combat loneliness. In our modern society, many feel disconnected and isolated. A 2024 Gallup poll found 20% of Americans experienced daily loneliness, and that feeling active and productive is one of the best ways to reduce it. Volunteering fits that prescription; it connects us and gives us purpose, letting us see the results of our work.
So let me ask you, do you volunteer?
If the answer is yes, thank you! But I encourage you to go a step further – invite a friend or family member to join you. If you don’t currently volunteer, now is a great time to start. Volunteerism takes on many shapes and sizes.  Find something that interests you and start there. Even if you start small, start today.

(Courtesy of National Medical Association) Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.











It's not just health insurance. It's a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
Bias and language barriers
Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
‘Ripple effect’
Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

(File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire  Bulletin)What was originally pitched as purely a cost-cutting measure has morphed into attacks on the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate.
When state Rep. Dan McGuire originally proposed eliminating the Office of the Child Advocate — which serves as the state’s watchdog for its child welfare, juvenile justice, and youth care systems, and advocates for the best interests of New Hampshire children — he said it had to be done because the state needed to save money amid a challenging fiscal environment. However, the Epsom Republican has since altered his argument, saying the office is interfering with the Legislature’s work.
McGuire, as chair of one of the three legislative subcommittees tasked with cutting hundreds of millions of dollars from the state budget, first publicly pitched eliminating the office — as well as the Commission on Aging and the Housing Appeals Board — during a March 17 work session.
“There’s a number of these smaller things that are sort of nice-to-haves, but they’re not necessary,” McGuire said that day. “And so, we need the money. I don’t know how to put it any blunter.”
The work session came in the midst of the lengthy state budgeting process that began in February when Gov. Kelly Ayotte released her budget proposal. Soon after, the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee deemed her revenue projections — which predicted a quick economic turnaround after years of lagging business tax revenues — too optimistic by hundreds of millions of dollars. Republicans on the Finance Committee, including McGuire, soon got to work cutting. McGuire was tasked with finding $200 million of savings, he said. Cutting the child advocate saves the state about $2.2 million.
However, when the budget came to the full House for a final vote, McGuire said it wasn’t just the need for cost-savings that warranted this elimination. 
“The Office of Child Advocate has interfered with rather than assisted needed legislation to reform child abuse and child welfare laws,” he said on the House floor this month.
McGuire assessed the office’s two main functions as advocating for and against legislation and serving in an ombudsman or conflict resolution-type role.
“There are no end to people interested in legislation who have child welfare in mind,” he said. “We don’t need to hire people to do that.”
McGuire added that the latter function was “duplicative” of that of the Division for Children, Youth, and Families, “and if DCYF is poorly run, the solution is not to create yet another agency, but its to fix and change the leadership of DCYF.”
McGuire did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for an interview.
Cassandra Sanchez, the state’s child advocate and head of that office, said neither McGuire nor his colleagues spoke to her about the elimination or raised any of their concerns before they moved to eliminate her office. She also said McGuire’s floor speech was the first she heard that he was displeased with her work.
“They did mention that there needed to be further cost-saving measures, but had not floated any idea of the potential of repealing our statute,” she previously told the Bulletin. “And given our office budget is so miniscule, I had not even thought of that as a potential option.”
Soon after McGuire’s statements on the House floor, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a roughly $15.36 billion budget — one that eliminated funding for the Office of the Child Advocate. That budget spends $643 million less than Ayotte’s proposal. Now, it will be considered by the Senate.
Ayotte, who included the office in her budget proposal, said she hopes to work with the Senate to restore the Office of the Child Advocate — as well as several other agencies, funds, and positions that House Republicans removed.
“There are many things that I’m going to be working with the Senate to prioritize and make sure that I get back in the priorities that were in my budget,” Ayotte, who is also a Republican, said earlier this month around the vote.
She added that she is “confident that the revenue numbers that I laid out in my budget are actually more accurate revenue numbers than the lower proposals made by the House.”
The Senate will now have the opportunity to either restore funding for the Office of the Child Advocate or keep it out of the budget. State Sen. James Gray, the Senate’s finance chair, said he won’t say for certain what the Senate hopes to do until the Senate Ways and Means Committee has completed its revenue projections, but he noted that the Senate Finance Committee is being pulled in many different directions.
“The Finance Committee has a lot of requests from a lot of different people to restore things from the House budget,” he said. “Before we can make any informed decision, we need to know what revenues are.”
Gray said programs to keep children safe — like the Office of the Child Advocate — are a priority. Funding Medicaid for people with disabilities is also a priority.
“I could go on and on,” he said. “It’s just too many priorities and the funding is limited.”
Gray said he and his legislative colleagues are always communicating with the governor’s office, but wouldn’t say whether they’d discussed the budget yet.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_4255-1-scaled-e1745430022130-1024x770.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 06:07:31.228370

Photo from the Central State website.Professors at Ohio’s only public historically Black university are worried a new controversial higher education law will have a chilling effect on their campus. 
Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio was originally the Normal and Industrial Department within Wilberforce University, the nation’s oldest private Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and a prominent stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1941, the department began to offer four-year degrees, and in 1951 it became independent from Wilberforce as Central State College. In 1965, Central State achieved university status.
Members of Central State University American Association of University Professors chapter recently talked to the Ohio Capital Journal about their concerns with Senate Bill 1, which is set to take effect at the end of June. Lawmakers quickly passed the bill and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law on March 28. 
The new law will ban diversity efforts, prohibit faculty strikes, regulate classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, create post-tenure reviews, put diversity scholarships at risk, create a retrenchment provision that block unions from negotiating on tenure, shorten university board of trustees terms from nine years down to six years, and require students take an American history course, among other things.

“Even if it’s not stopping me from teaching something on a practical level, it could make me think twice about something,” said J. Brendan Shaw, president of the Central State’s AAUP chapter. 
He said he has been in meetings before the bill passed where English faculty have proposed classes about specific ethnic groups, but “other faculty have said, ‘Are you sure you want to do that?”
“Even if the letter of the bill does not say that, it still creates that chilling effect of making people think twice about something that our students might benefit from,” Shaw said. 
Wilberforce University is Ohio’s other HBCU, but it is a private university. S.B. 1 only applies to Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
Sarah Siff, an assistant professor of history, is concerned about the chilling effect on people’s speech and the potential damage to academic freedom. 
“It’s quite stark to think that someone’s response to that might just be, well, then I won’t teach that part, or I’ll toss that out and keep myself safe,” she said. “As a person who does not have tenure, I really have to think about that.”
Central State students are reportedly worried about being able to access scholarships and grants that are specific to Black students. 
“Those are just lost opportunities for our students to have the same opportunity that their peers would at a different institution, especially their white peers,” Shaw said. 
A little more than 5,400 students attended Central State in Fall 2022 — 33% were Black, 26% were white and 12% were Hispanic, according to the university’s Fact Book. 
Central State faculty said they have heard Black students say the bill is not for them. 
“This bill is enlisting white students to let the authorities know when they become uncomfortable in class talking about racial history, talking about racial equity and justice,” Siff said. 
Anthony Arment, a biology professor, said the law will impact the humanities the hardest. 
“It’s basically putting faculty in the position where they’re being bullied into self-censoring,” he said. 
University of Toledo suspending nine undergrad programs in compliance with Ohio higher ed law

He is also worried the law is taking effect over the summer when faculty are supposed to be off. 
“All of these changes and policy changes are going to be done largely without faculty representation,” Arment said. 
Jeremy Holtgrave, an associate professor of physics, said the principle of academic freedom seems to be under assault. 
“I think that’s foundational to our university system or at least I believe it should be,” he said. 
Siff said the soon-to-be law does affect how she thinks about teaching her history classes. 
“It does change the way that I, at least, think about events of the civil rights movement, and I no longer assume that it’s self-evident why activists would make sure that the schools got integrated,” she said.

Flood insurance. It’s something that most people have heard of and that many probably have a notion they should look into as the climate warms and severe storms grow more frequent.
To their credit, some have done more than think about it. As NC Newsline’s Galen Bacharier reported this week, about 10 percent of businesses and five percent of homeowners in western North Carolina actually had flood insurance prior to Hurricane Helene and were, quite understandably, counting on their policies to help them rebuild in the aftermath of the disaster.
Unfortunately, as Bacharier also reported, that’s often not been the case. In numerous instances, it’s taken several months for the policyholders to collect and even then, many payments have been only partial. Many other claims have been denied outright based on technicalities and other questionable grounds.
The bottom line: the industry’s failure to aid people and businesses in need cries out for better government oversight of flood insurance policies to protect consumers. If state and federal policymakers are serious about their pledges to aid disaster victims, they’ll make it an immediate top priority.

(Getty Images)Our health care system, at all levels, is facing unprecedented challenges. We have been weathering the storm, but the environment in which we operate is highly unpredictable: we’ve faced significant disruption, from public health challenges to shifting rules and regulations to economic uncertainties. Now, we are staring down the very real possibility of significant funding cuts at the state and federal levels.
The home-based care sector of our state’s health care system, in which the agency I lead operates, is especially exposed in this dynamic environment. New Hampshire is our nation’s second oldest — and fastest-aging — state.
Home-based care services are a key part of our state’s health care landscape, providing complex medical care, monitoring, rehabilitation, and support to patients where they are most comfortable — in their homes. Many of the people we care for are our communities’ most at-risk — elder adults and people of all ages with mobility or transportation issues, chronic illnesses, and other health challenges. It has been shown that providing care directly to patients in their homes helps prevent unnecessary hospitalizations, reduce health care costs, and improve overall health outcomes.
Last year, in the 72 New Hampshire communities Granite VNA serves, we provided more than 141,000 home care visits to more than 8,000 patients. Another 45,000 hospice visits supported 1,200 patients. In terms of dollars and cents, we provided more than $6 million in community benefits in 2024, including $2.5 million in subsidized and charity care to patients unable to pay.
The increase in our elder population and the growing need for home-based care collide daily with long-running issues like persistent workforce shortages, rising costs, and now, the specter of significant funding cuts.
In Washington, Congress is considering $880 billion in Medicaid cuts, and in late March, the federal government announced that it would take back more than $80 million in unspent pandemic relief funds from our state, further reducing our public health capabilities.
Here at home, we are swinging back and forth on Medicaid provider payment rates. After significant — and long overdue — increases in provider payments last biennium, the New Hampshire House passed a new state budget that reduces those provider rates by 3%, hoping for a savings of up to $53 million. This will have a direct impact on our ability to adequately care for some of our state’s most vulnerable patients.
These reductions will have a domino effect. Health care organizations like Granite VNA may face the possibility of reducing patient services. Even if patients can find access to home-based care, some people will delay care because they cannot afford it and wind up in emergency rooms. Sicker patients will require more costly care, increasing the burden on our already strained hospitals.
The dominos fall on those around our patients, too: When home-based care services are reduced, family members often need to take on the responsibility of providing care, which can lead to emotional and financial strain, especially for those already struggling financially.
The proposed federal and state-level funding cuts threaten to further destabilize a home-based care system already under duress, leaving our communities — our families, friends, and neighbors — without essential support and increasing overall health care costs.
Given the continuing storm battering our industry, we can no longer lean on “the way things were.” Like other health care providers around the state and nation, we are working to become more agile, flexible, adaptable, and open to innovative ideas and new ways of doing things to meet the ever-changing needs of our patients and our community — we have no choice but to do so.
For 125 years, Granite VNA has pledged to enhance the dignity and independence of people by delivering quality health care and promoting wellness in homes and communities through all stages of life. Now more than ever, we are working to uphold that pledge despite our challenges.
Our patients and their families deserve nothing less — from every one of us.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/homecare-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 05:00:50.120297

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Even before President Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of tariffs on April 2, three fourths of businesses surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said they would have to raise prices in response. Some said they already were.
Rising prices — particularly for people with lower incomes — are thought to be one of the primary factors in Trump’s win last November. If the surveyed businesses are correct in their expectations, Trump’s tariffs will only make it worse.
Tariffs are taxes on imports. Trump has sold them as a way to encourage manufacturing and other businesses to return to the United States. Critics say that ignores that manufacturing is increasingly automated, and that many of the jobs filled by workers overseas aren’t attractive to Americans.
On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on the great majority of our trading partners. The announcement was greeted by plunging markets for stocks and bonds, signaling that because of Trump’s unpredictable policies, investors were losing faith in U.S.-backed securities.

The shock prompted Trump to implement a 90-day pause on most of the import taxes. But a baseline 10% tariff and much larger ones on China remain. That had the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday significantly worsening its outlook for global and U.S. economic growth.
Businesses across Ohio, and in adjacent parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky seemed to predict much of this in February.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland conducts eight yearly surveys of business and community leaders in the Fourth District, which it represents. It uses them to inform its contributions to the Federal Open Market Committee. 
Known as the “Fed,” that institution sets key interest rates that influence how expensive it is to borrow money throughout the economy. It’s an important tool in stimulating a slow economy or cooling one that’s overheated.
Trump’s attacks on the independence of the Fed led to a major stock selloff Monday before mostly recovering on Tuesday. 
“​​Many companies in the Cleveland Fed’s District said tariffs would raise their costs and lower demand, according to a new report summarizing the results of several tariff questions included in the February round of the Survey of Regional Conditions and Expectations,” the agency said Tuesday in a press release announcing the results.
Of those surveyed, 85% said they anticipated higher input costs as a consequence of higher import taxes. The retail, manufacturing, construction, and real estate sectors anticipated the heaviest impact, with transportation and financial and professional services expecting less of a blow.
Cleveland Fed II
A full 75% of those who said their businesses would be impacted by tariffs said they would have to raise prices in response, and 60% said the tariffs would reduce demand. Despite Trump’s claims, just 9% of respondents said that increased tariffs would raise demand for their products or services.C
Nearly half, 46%, of those who said they would be affected by tariffs said they would or already were passing those costs on to their customers. Twenty nine percent said they’d find a new domestic supplier and 27% said they move up purchases ahead of implementation of any tariffs.

They’ve introduced at least seven measures tweaking the homestead exemption — for disabled vets, military spouses, the elderly — and a handful more changing how counties calculate what homeowners owe.
Most notably, however, House lawmakers have proposed an automatic rollback in the state budget that triggers if a school district carries over any more than 30% of their operating revenue.
An organization backed by realtors, county auditors, and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce is wading into that debate. The Ohio Taxpayer Protection Coalition is urging lawmakers to avoid “unvoted” property tax increases.
“Our point isn’t to take away revenue from school districts,” coalition chair and former state tax commissioner Tom Zaino explained. “Our point is to reduce the rate of increase of revenue without a vote of school district residents.”
House Bill 920
Zaino argued that state lawmakers need to revisit a measure passed in the 1970s meant to insulate homeowners from rising home values. Property taxes are calculated in mills — one mill is one thousandth of a dollar, or one tenth of a percent.
In every county, taxing authorities like local governments, schools, and parks, can levy a total of 10 mills that will grow as home values increase. Any share beyond those 10 mills has to get approval from voters. Meanwhile, to receive state funding, school districts must levy at least 20 mills, or 2% of assessed property value.
House Bill 920 placed a check on those voted levies to ensure rising home prices don’t result in a taxing authority raising extra money. In effect, if your home value goes up, that slice of your property tax rate would decrease to keep your tax bill steady.
“What’s happened, though, over the last 50 years,” Zaino said, “is that these protections have been eroded by many changes made by the General Assembly, which has effectively created loopholes.”
The tax reductions in HB 920 apply to most levies beyond a school district’s 20 mill floor. So, school districts have been resourceful and looked to other sources of funding like emergency levies or local income taxes. That way they can meet immediate funding needs and still benefit from rising property values.
Zaino argued that amounts to an increase in taxes that voters didn’t approve, and lawmakers should prevent that strategy. To that end, the Ohio Taxpayer Protection Coalition is supporting legislation that would recalculate the 20 mill floor to include those other funding sources.
Bailey Williams, from the liberal think tank Policy Matters Ohio argued Zaino’s coalition is blowing the problem out of proportion. “While property values across the state have seen significant growth coming out of the pandemic,” he argued, “property tax revenues have only grown at a fraction of that rate.”
Making the changes Zaino wants “will harm schools, put more levies on the ballot, and will not fix the fact residential taxpayers are overburdened,” Williams argued.
School districts’ view
School leaders argue the problem isn’t just districts making clever use of the system. As property values rise, HB 920 will reduce a homeowner’s rate — but there’s a hard stop at 20 mills. That means if property values rise high enough, the reductions stop working.
Paul Imhoff from the Buckeye Association of School Administrators told lawmakers in 2019, there were 168 districts at the 20 mill floor. By 2023, that figure had ballooned to 409.
“Eighty-nine percent of the new floor districts went through reappraisal or update in 2023,” he explained, “which indicates that the driving force in 20 mill floor districts clearly is rising property values.”
He warned adding new levies to the calculation to generate more reductions won’t help homeowners in the 203 districts that don’t have those extra levies. In the end the bill would “force the affected school districts to either cut essential services or place more levies on the ballot in response, or both,” he argued.
In a written statement, Jennifer Hogue from the Ohio School Boards Association explained the group supports “thoughtful, targeted property tax relief that helps those most in need without undermining the essential funding public schools rely on.” She argued any property tax discussion relies on a “clear recognition of the vital role local taxes play” in funding public schools.
“While we are open to reform, we cannot support measures that limit local control or compromise a district’s ability to meet the needs of their students,” Hogue added. “Any changes must protect the stability and predictability of school funding.”
A different proposal would allow revenue increases from rising property values, but they wouldn’t be able to exceed the general inflation rate over the past three years. In his testimony, Imhoff noted his organization is still reviewing the bill.
Zaino allowed that it would be an improvement and address some of the school funding concerns. Still, he grumbled districts “can’t rely on unvoted tax increases,” and insisted lawmakers shouldn’t give up on closing the loopholes districts have been taking advantage of for years. “There’s not any one bill that is the silver bullet here,” he said.
Other legislation
Zaino offered a tempered response to the various homestead and other property tax exemptions lawmakers have proposed. Those changes are relatively easy to understand and offer immediate relief, but that targeted approach usually winds up shifting the tax burden to others.
“Somebody’s paying for this, Zaino said, “so it’s not like taxpayers are completely saving on that.”
Williams argued instead of rejiggering the property tax calculation or providing new exemptions, lawmakers should employ a circuit breaker, like the one proposed by state Sen. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp. That approach makes tax reductions based on a share of the homeowner’s income rather than the amount of funding a school district is expecting.
Williams explained one group regularly cited for property tax exemptions is seniors.
“There are some seniors who do not need property tax relief,” he said. “The best way to tell is by how much of their income is consumed by property taxes, not looking at their age. The circuit breaker is targeted enough to get those seniors who need the most help, while asking those who can afford it to pay their fair share.”
As for the budget proposal capping school district carryover balances, Zaino said they’re still considering their position. He noted it might encourage districts to allocate that funding or just spend it down to avoid the reduction.

Early voting is already underway. Depending on where you live, you may have city council seats, judges, or a school levy. But on every ballot across the state, you’ll have Issue 2.
It is a constitutional amendment meant to support local infrastructure projects.
“This particular program has provided for 19,000 projects in all 88 counties since its inception,” state Rep. Scott Oelslager, R-North Canton, said.
Every ten years, voters choose whether or not to renew the state’s ability to issue billions in bonds for the State Capital Improvement Program (SCIP) and the Local Transportation Improvement Program (LTIP).
This year, the amount would be $2.5 billion. This resolution will increase the annual amount for the program from $200 million to $250 million per year. This will be paid for through state general obligation debt.
“In terms of contributing to a healthier Ohio economy, renewal of this program will result in thousands of good-paying jobs to do the construction work on the projects that this program will finance,” state Rep. Dan Troy, D-Willowick, said.
These grants cover roads, bridges, water supply, wastewater treatment, stormwater collection and solid waste disposal. These bonds must be used for these projects.
Read the full ballot amendment here.
“We all want safe roads and safe bridges and so forth,” Cuyahoga County voter Joseph said after voting yes.
The money would not be able to be used for other types of projects, like for entertainment.
To be very clear — this bond issue is unrelated to the Cleveland Browns’ request for $600 million in bonds. This money would not be able to go to them.
“I think there are a lot of people who are a little nervous about that,” the voter said.
Issue 2 has wide bipartisan support, from the Ohio Chamber of Commerce to each trade union. There seems to be no official, active campaign against it, but voter Tim argued he is already paying too much in taxes.
“You pay tax and tax and tax and now the state is going to borrow money to do infrastructure,” he said. “We should use the means we have to do infrastructure.”
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, state Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, referenced how the original project was about $1 billion in 1987, but this one doubles the cost.
“The bond issue in 1987, under Governor Celeste (D), was because our roads etc were in disrepair….BACK THEN it was critical to address a backlog of local infrastructure needs, as aging roads and bridges strained existing revenues amid rising costs and traffic demands. Why do we keep renewing it WITH INCREASES?” she wrote.
“As we are all aware, labor and material costs have increased,” Troy said.
In short — voting yes would renew the public works project. Voting no would stop the program.

Kennedy Jr., secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)The U.S. Surgeon General’s Office released a “Healthy People” report in 1979. Section I of the report, titled “Toward a Healthier America,” was a cooperation of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine, and the 1978 Departmental Task Force on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.
It opens with the following statement: “The health of the American people has never been better.”
I came across this report almost five years ago, while researching an article about Black maternal health. I still cringe at the level of disconnect needed to make such a declaration based on detailed data outlining health disparities attributed to environment, biology, behavior, and inadequacies in the health care system.
One such disparity is infant mortality: “The death rate in 1977 for Black infants (24 per 1,000 live births) is about the same as that for white infants 25 years ago. Additional gains are clearly attainable. If present trends in the United States continue, our rate should drop below 12 in 1982, and new preventive efforts could allow us to reach the goal of nine by 1990.”
Black infants born in the U.S. in 1977 died at the rate of white infants born in the U.S. in 1952. By 1952, more births occurred in hospitals with trained medical professionals and the use of medications such as anesthesia and penicillin for those who could afford them. The introduction of Medicaid increased affordability for minority communities but did not significantly improve outcomes.
From 1933 — when infant mortality rates first became available nationally — to today, infant mortality rates for Black infants have consistently averaged at least twice that of white infants.
It is not lost on me that the infant mortality rate for non-Hispanic Black infants was 10.9 per 1,000 live births in 2023. Every other infant mortality rate, except American Indian and Alaska Native, is below Healthy People’s 1990 target of nine despite significant medical and technological advances since 1979. Infant mortality rates are also a key indicator of maternal health.
The maternal mortality rate in the United States is highest among developed nations, with rates of death for all U.S. women at 22.3 per 100,000 live births and Black women at 49.5 in 2024. Some 45 years following the release of Healthy People, the maternal mortality rate in America is equal to underdeveloped countries.
How healthy can a country be if disparities continue to be identified within similar ranges for the same segments of its population?
The report further states the health of our country can be improved and maintained through personal responsibility, efforts of decision-makers, and the private sector in conjunction with “intensified educational efforts by schools, health providers, and the media.”
Schools and health providers are completely overwhelmed by the needs of Americans still recovering from the pandemic. Most of their efforts feel like one step forward, three steps back. Research indicates that patient satisfaction with health care facilities is significantly lower post-pandemic, with higher instances of negative interactions identified in predominantly minority areas.
A 2021 meta-analysis confirmed the persistence of many of the health inequities discussed in “Healthy People.” The disproportionate existence of these health conditions contributed to increased risk of COVID-19 complications in already struggling minority communities. The Annie E. Casey Foundation identified “unprecedented drops” in basic reading and math following the pandemic. Minority and low-income students attending low-income schools historically experienced significant learning deficits before the pandemic.
We must recognize that some of the educators attempting to make up for the deficits in reading and math include those dissatisfied with health care facilities. They may be working with health challenges and frustration with their providers. I cannot speak for anyone else, but when I am not feeling well, the quality of my work is less than standard and it shows.
“Healthy People” hints at the interconnectedness of biological, environmental, and behavioral well-being contributing to overall health, and the need for policies and programming at all levels to consider prevention first.
Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s justification for reorganizing the Department of Health and Human Services into the Administration for a Healthy America feels eerily like the indifference that led to the 1979 perception that Americans were healthier than they have ever been.
The effort to “make America healthy again” assumes that there is a moment in time when America was healthy. The targets identified in the 1979 “Healthy People” report remain unmet for many, contradicting any semblance of healthy functioning for America. Logic dictates that it is impossible for America to be healthy again when many segments of its population have yet to reach a baseline of health.
The benefits of starting a health improvement program are rarely seen overnight. However, at a molecular level, changes may occur almost immediately. The same can be said of federal programs to help those seeking a healthy existence. Disrupting a program because it lacks “visible” progress ignores the needs of individuals and punishes them for being human. In either instance, disruption can result in setbacks that are just as, if not more harmful than the old habits.
Reorganizing the Department of Health and Human Services without fully understanding its work sends the message that public health is expendable, that lives measured in quiet progress and unseen healing are unworthy of investment. Authentic wellness is a journey, not an annual report that gives all the good feels until it is put in a drawer to be forgotten.
If we claim to be a nation that values life, dignity, and resilience, we must protect the institutions designed to care for our most vulnerable, not strip them away in the name of impatience or politics. Healing takes time. Compassion requires commitment.

Every lawyer and bar association across America should stand with them in this fight for judicial independence (the Cleveland Metro Bar was among the first to take a stand). 
Yet, we must confront an uncomfortable truth: many of these same firms helped create the environment that made Trump’s rise possible.
Before becoming victims of Trump’s transparently corrupt attacks, these prestigious firms participated in the culture of behind-the-scenes influence peddling that eroded public trust in our institutions. Their lobbying practices and the revolving door between government service and private practice fostered a two-tier system of justice that alienated working-class Americans and drove them toward dangerous populist alternatives like Donald Trump. The massive donations from these firms to candidates and parties helped corrupt both Democrats and Republicans.
Most attorneys in America don’t earn their living through influence pedaling. While we must defend these targeted firms, we should recognize that they serve the wealthiest individuals and corporations in America, charging four-figure hourly rates that place them beyond the reach of ordinary citizens.
The brazen nature of President Trump’s executive orders against Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, Covington and Burling, Jenner and Block, and Wilmer Hale was shocking. These orders prohibited these firms from representing the federal government, canceled contracts with their clients, revoked necessary security clearances and barred their personnel from federal buildings — a clear unconstitutional assault on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

Even more disturbing has been the capitulation we’ve witnessed. Paul Weiss’s surrender was followed by similar settlements from Skadden Arps and Wilkie Farr and Gallagher and five other firms. These once-respected institutions abandoned their diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments and pledged millions of pro bono hours to Trump-endorsed causes. The rest of the top law firms in the country by revenue joined the hall of shame by refusing to sign a brief in support of Perkins Coie,
These lawyers have chosen profit over principle when given the chance to defend our profession’s independence and the Constitution itself. 
With these elite firms either fighting for survival, capitulating to presidential pressure, or hiding under their desks, the rest of the bar must fill the void. Those of us who charge far less than $1,000 per hour must step forward to protect democracy and prevent authoritarian overreach. 
Here in Ohio we can educate the public, represent immigrants facing deportation, defend wrongfully terminated federal employees, represent the defunded nonprofits and local governments that are literally saving lives and providing vital services to our communities, and bring constitutional challenges against authoritarian policies that usurp congressional authority. 
Over my 38 years in practice I’ve worked with great consumer, personal injury, domestic, bankruptcy, criminal, government, and transactional lawyers representing working and middle-class Americans and small businesses. 
These lawyer’s courtroom and analytic skills are every bit as strong as our tall building lawyer counterparts. Lawyers in every community need to organize and collaborate to make sure that every attack on individual liberty and constitutional protection is challenged as the administration continues to flood the zone with their efforts to break historic legal precedents to consolidate power and to enrich themselves and their friends at the expense of the rest of us. 
As some of our profession’s most powerful institutions retreat from the field, the burden falls on us —the everyday lawyers of America — to champion individual rights and defend constitutional boundaries. The future of our republic may well depend on our willingness to answer this call.

More states are enacting bans on “Glock switches,” small devices about the size of a U.S. quarter that can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.
Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices, but the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”
 Recovered at crime scenes

The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.
The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.
Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
More law enforcement agencies reconsider use of popular Sig Sauer P320 handgun

In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department. The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”
 Alabama and New Mexico

Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Democratic state Rep. Phil Ensler, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.










This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– emocratic Alabama state Rep. Phil Ensler


According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.
New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.
Red flag laws are increasingly being used to protect gun owners in crisis

“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.
 Lawsuits against Glock

Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

,California,2025-04-24 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,New California school data project fulfills campaign promise Newsom made,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/school-data-site-california/,The Cradle-to Career dashboard shows where high school students land after graduation. It could make schools more accountable to parents and taxpayers.,"Gavin Newsom can — and should — be faulted for making campaign promises six years ago that he must have known were impossible to achieve, such as his vows to create single-payer health care and build 3.5 million new housing units.
When reminded of them after becoming governor, he dismissed them as “aspirational,” a caveat he neglected to attach to his original pledges.
Nevertheless, credit is due when one of his promises becomes reality, as it did this week when the state launched the beginnings of a long-needed system of tracking how the state’s public school students fare in classrooms and later in life.
The Cradle-to-Career project released its first batch of numbers, along with video tutorials on how to access the data.
“With the C2C Student Pathways Dashboard now live, Californians can visualize their futures by seeing disconnected data from across sectors and previously unavailable insights, all in one place,” Newsom said in a statement. “The Golden State is once again leading the way in innovation, connecting our education system to the workforce to ensure everyone has the freedom to succeed.”
However, not everyone in the rarified ranks of education researchers and reformers echoed Newsom’s boasts.
Alex Barrios, president of the Educational Results Partnership, a business-backed education policy coalition, complained that “the dashboard fails to do what it promised. It doesn’t represent the journeys of all students and how they navigate to and through careers.
“By following the career trajectories of only college graduates, it assumes the only path to success for students is through a four-year college degree,” Barrio alleges.
The new data system should include all of the factors that Barrio’s organization lists, but its criticism may be premature, since officials say they intend to expand the project’s scope as rapidly as it can obtain data.
Assuming that the project does widen its reach, C2C, as it’s dubbed, not only will be a lasting accomplishment for Newsom, but it will fill a void that’s existed far too long. Without reliable data on outcomes, the nation’s largest school system operates in an accountability vacuum, which the education establishment seems to prefer.
The state Department of Education has a “dashboard” that purports to give parents, taxpayers and voters a picture of how well schools are doing their job. However, the current system is a mishmash of educational jargon that is difficult to decipher. It also skews the ratings in ways that minimize actual academic achievement, such as in reading, writing and mathematics, and elevates peripheral factors it calls “multiple measures.”
Thus, it downplays the fact that California’s students fare very poorly vis-a-vis those in other states and the “achievement gap” still broadly separates low-income and English-learner students from those with more privileged circumstances.

Commentary 
California’s dysfunctional ‘dashboard’ of school ratings finally gets a well-deserved beatdown 

by Dan Walters 





Education reformers have long pushed for obtaining and publishing more objective and complete data, especially after former Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature overhauled school finance a decade ago to provide more funds to schools with substantial numbers of what were called “at-risk” students.
Better numbers would, the reformers said, provide a clearer understanding of whether Brown’s Local Control Funding Formula was working. 
Brown, however, backed the education establishment’s preference for getting the money without strict accountability for how it was spent and whether it was having a positive effect. He said he trusted that local school officials would spend the extra money wisely, calling it “subsidiarity,” a secular version of an obscure religious principle.
After Newsom succeeded Brown he quickly reversed that position and called for a comprehensive data system to track how students were faring during and after their journeys through the school system. The Legislature responded by authorizing the C2C system.

Getty ImagesThere may be a lot fewer likes, comments and subscriptions coming out of Georgia schools next summer when a ban on cell phones for all elementary and middle schoolers is set to go into effect during the school day, pending Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature on a bill.
Ban backers say there will also be a lot fewer distractions and disciplinary problems once devices are out of kids’ hands.
A promising pilot
A handful of districts around the state have implemented their own phone bans. DeKalb County Schools has launched a pilot program in 17 of its schools as part of its “Disconnect to Reconnect” initiative launched in August. Darnell Logan, the district’s director of student relations, said the initial results have been very promising.
During the first semester of the program, the pilot schools saw a 70% drop in student referrals for district due process hearings – hearings for when a school wants to suspend a student for more than 10 days – as well as a 15-16% decrease in suspensions.
Logan said the district already had a policy against using cell phones in class, but before the program, teachers had a hard time enforcing the rule with each of their students. Now, the kids lock up their devices at the start of the day – about half of the participating schools have a phone locker in the classrooms and the other half use special phone locking pouches from a company called Yondr.
Logan said the program was not an immediate hit with students and some parents.
“It varied, you know, the students, of course, were not for the pilot process,” he said. “Parents also had concerns. The main concern for parents was they talked about safety. They felt they needed to be able to contact their students anytime if something was to happen at the school.”
But he said the district stressed to parents that they could get in touch with their students by calling the schools and that procedures are in place for emergencies – for example, administrators are able to unlock the storage devices so students can access their phones after evacuating to a safe place.
Verdaillia Turner, president of the Georgia Federation of Teachers and a former classroom teacher, said she hears the safety argument from parents but rejects it because she says mass shootings are the exception, while teachers are flooded with disciplinary and academic problems caused by kids on phones every day.
Turner said kids are showing declines in imagination and attention span, which she blames on cell phones and social media.
“How many hours are these kids on their phones and their computers, and how are they using them? You tell me why a child needs a cell phone. Parents who complain about the cost of various educational apparatus and educational support that they should be adding are the same folk that’s paying money for cell phones.”
Logan said his team is conducting regular interviews during the pilot, and even some of the students are coming around to the ban.
“Of course there’s kids who say they don’t like it, but then those same kids who don’t like it have also said ‘it does help me focus or pay attention, it has helped me to be more sociable,’” he said. “Kids have stated that they have made new friends and talked to people that they normally would not have talked to because they were so engaged on their phone scrolling during the school day.”
Some students try to get around the ban – either by finding creative ways to open the pouches or locking up a decoy phone and keeping their real one in their pocket – but a few ne’er-do-wells don’t spoil the overall benefit, Logan said.
“Even if those things happen, we are still not seeing students readily pulling out their phones, using the phones during the school day,” he said. “Our ultimate goal was to hit 75 to 80% of our students with this initiative, and we’re truly reaching that at this point. Because if you walk into a school that is doing our Yondr pilot program, you’re not going to see phones out as you would have in previous school years.”
Nia Batra, a member of the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition and a student at Decatur High School, said she’s a fan of her school’s phone ban. She said the policy there is to lock up phones at the beginning of every period – more lenient than the pending bill, which would call for a ban between the first and final bells.
Batra said unplugging, even for just the school day, can help students dealing with anxiety or other issues and help them focus on their academics instead of what their friends are up to.
“We know that anxiety and depression is rising because of the constant use of smartphones, and especially since the pandemic, students just don’t have face-to-face conversations with each other. It’s really difficult to get students to engage with one another,” she added.
“After the ban, a lot of people are actually going like, ‘now I’m actually focusing on my learning, I’m getting work done in class, I’m less stressed about it, I can actually focus on what’s going on,’” she added. “So there’s a little bit of personal, like, ‘OK, yeah, this actually benefits me.’”
‘Real school safety measures’
While she supports keeping cell phones away during school hours, Batra said the safety argument resonates with her and a lot of other children.
“We had a lockdown last year in our school after a gun went off,” she said. “I remember hiding under my desk. I was texting my parents and my sister, like, ‘I love you, and I don’t know what’s going on. I’m really scared.’ And so whenever I have to put my phone in a box, I’m thinking about that. I’m thinking about what if something were to happen again, and I can’t text my family? We just had the deadliest school shooting in Georgia.”
Batra was speaking about the September shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder that took the lives of two students and two teachers.
The shooting has changed a lot for Layla Renee Contreras, including her thoughts on school cell phone bans. Contreras is lead organizer for Change for Chee, an organization pushing for safety improvements in the wake of the shooting. She’s also an Apalachee High School graduate, and her mother and sister were at the school during the shooting.
“Technology is part of our new normal and it’s going to be,” she said. “Kids need to realize that there’s a time and place for cell phones and during school isn’t one of those, but it shouldn’t be taken off of their person in case of an emergency.”
Contreras said safety protocols like unlocking storage devices after an evacuation may be well intentioned, but may not be followed during a chaotic situation like a school shooting.
“Teachers, being part of a procedure, grabbing a cell phone box is not going to be the No. 1, it really isn’t,” she said. “I definitely want to have it be part of that, but the way the kids and teachers described to me, it was just a matter of protecting themselves and getting to a safe spot. They’re not going to be worrying about XYZ grabbing a specific list or a box of cell phones. It’s a matter of life or death, and the kids having it on their person already, I mean, that’s the quickest way, to just have it on them.”
Contreras said she would like to see lawmakers take action on gun storage laws or a database on student disciplinary problems that can follow students when they transfer schools.
The teenage suspect in the Apalachee shooting was interviewed by law enforcement a year before the attack regarding threatening social media posts targeting another school in Jackson County, but that information did not follow him when he transferred to Barrow County.
Lawmakers passed a bill this year with sweeping provisions aimed at preventing another shooting, including requirements that schools quickly send transfer student records to their new district, but some major provisions were stripped out, including the creation of a statewide database on students who may pose threats.
State lawmakers have proposed bills to encourage Georgians to buy gun lockers and other storage devices through a tax credit or to create a law punishing people whose improperly stored guns are accessed by minors and used in a crime. Neither bill moved forward this year.
“To be honest, this is a performative ban, because the phones aren’t the enemy here, inaction is, and we need to be talking about real school safety measures,” Contreras said. “That could look like more gun safety laws or seeing a threat database be installed and put into place or addressing more root causes of mental health.”
Though she supports the ban, Batra said she doesn’t feel especially supported by lawmakers either.
“When we’re talking about health and safety, if we’re not making the same investments in counselors and gun safety as we are for phones, it makes us feel like they care more about our test scores than our actual lives,” she said. “It’s not about our mental health as far as phones, it’s about what level of achievement can we generate.”

This is not politics as usual. It’s a coordinated dismantling of democracy, from immigration raids to protest bans, campus crackdowns to union-busting. The Trump administration is waging a full-spectrum assault on civil liberties.
One of the most alarming fronts is immigration. Citing the Alien Enemies Act, the administration has launched deportations without due process, targeting not only undocumented people but also legal residents and visa holders. Over 1,500 international students have reportedly had their visas revoked, many for participating in pro-Palestinian activism. Trump’s stated goal is to end birthright citizenship.
The case of Kilmar Ábrego García., a union apprentice in Maryland, makes this clear. Despite a court order shielding him from removal, he was forcibly deported to El Salvador, where he remains imprisoned. The administration’s refusal to comply with a Supreme Court order demanding his return shows open contempt for judicial authority.


Higher education is also under siege. Harvard University is suing the administration over a $2.3 billion federal funding freeze, imposed after the school resisted demands to curb diversity programs and student activism. This is not governance, it’s retaliation.
Since early 2025, dozens of states have introduced anti-protest laws, aimed at criminalizing dissent, particularly protests against Israel’s U.S.-backed genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank. Students like Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk have been detained simply for speaking out. These laws are designed to intimidate and silence a generation.
Meanwhile, under the Project 2025 blueprint, Trump allies are pushing to dismantle decades of labor protections. Proposals include banning voluntary union recognition, allowing mid-contract decertification, and legalizing employer-controlled “unions.” Most dangerous of all: a plan to let states opt out of federal labor law altogether, gutting the NLRA and FLSA. Trump has already stripped over a million federal workers of bargaining rights and purged pro-labor officials from the National Labor Relations Board and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, crippling the very agencies meant to defend working people.
This is authoritarianism. These attacks are not isolated, they are part of a broader authoritarian agenda. This administration governs by targeting the marginalized, dismantling institutions, and criminalizing dissent. The warning signs of fascism are here, and we ignore them at our peril.
Solidarity is our strongest weapon. Together, we can resist the erosion of our freedoms and reclaim a future grounded in justice, dignity, and democracy.
Organizers and community members from around the state welcome you to participate in a mass meeting on Saturday, April 26, at 1 p.m. at First & Summerfield United Methodist Church in New Haven.

These worsening conditions are why my coworkers and I, warehouse processors and quality technicians in Enfield, decided to form a union with Teamsters Local 671 almost a year ago to have a collective voice on the job.

Lawrence Sanchez
Our employer – i-Health, a division of DSM-Firmenich, a multi-billion dollar European conglomerate headquartered in Switzerland – could have chosen then to start respecting our rights and dignity as workers.
Instead, DSM-Firmenich chose to respond with coercion, threats, and a fear campaign in an attempt to intimidate us to vote against forming a union. When we resiliently defeated these illegal tactics and won our union election, DSM-Firmenich retaliated by increasing the length of workdays at the facility by 50 percent through mandatory overtime, added a sixth day to the work week, withheld raises and took away the Memorial Day holiday.
Even with our certified union, DSM-Firmenich repeatedly refused to bargain in good faith to reach a first contract. What options were we left with?
The decision to strike is never an easy one to make, and is often only made when companies commit multiple Unfair Labor Practices like ours has done. Companies know how difficult the decision to strike is, and take advantage of that difficulty to make demeaning offers they know their workers cannot accept. So, we voted to go on strike in December 2024 – and that strike has continued to date, as DSM-Firmenich has only doubled down on their anti-worker posture.
Another example was the Stop & Shop strike of 2019, where the company’s offer entailed eliminating raises and premium pay on national holidays and Sundays, reducing contributions to pensions, and kicking family members off their health insurance plans. Thankfully, Stop & Shop workers united within their union, United Food and Commercial Workers, and went out on strike to preserve their wages and benefits and get a fair contract.
These examples of companies knowingly engaging in bad faith bargaining and committing numerous Unfair Labor Practices is why workers need the Connecticut General Assembly to pass the bill to establish unemployment insurance for striking workers. 
As I testified – with my union siblings across Connecticut’s labor movement – at the Labor Committee Public Hearing on February 13 this year, we believe this bill will encourage companies to bargain in good faith from the beginning, rather than attempt to intimidate and starve out their workers. By passing this bill, we would join our neighboring states of New York and New Jersey who have had this pro-worker policy in effect for years.
With Donald Trump dismantling the National Labor Relations Board, employers are more free than ever to rampantly abuse workers. By shutting down the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Trump has also deprived workers of further options to settle labor disputes. A worker’s right to strike – which is legally protected – is one of the only options they have left to fight for justice on the job. 
Unemployment insurance for striking workers will strengthen these last remaining tools workers need to fight for fairness. Contrary to certain uninformed perspectives, this bill will reduce the number of strikes, not increase them, by incentivizing employers to bargain in good faith and avoid increased unemployment costs.
This year, State Senate President Martin Looney, Labor Committee Senate Chair Julie Kushner and Senate Democrats filed Senate Bill 8, a combined warehouse worker legislation and Unemployment Insurance for Striking Workers bill that would help greatly in creating a safe and humane workplace for workers. In addition, House Democrats have filed House Bill 6904, a separate bill with just Unemployment Insurance for Striking Workers. I’m extremely grateful for the support of Sens. Looney, Kushner and the many other House and Senate members who understand the importance of taking state action to stand with workers at a time when federal labor protections are disintegrating.
We ask that all members of the General Assembly listen to our stories and experiences that were expressed in the public hearings for these bills, and to pass Unemployment Insurance for Striking Workers.

When gold prices rise — as they have, in dramatic fashion, this spring — state revenue barely ticks up. 
Industry critics often draw this comparison, arguing that the huge mining corporations that operate in Alaska aren’t compensating the state enough for the minerals they produce.
Those minerals yielded just $28.5 million from Alaska’s mining license tax, on average, during each of the past four fiscal years. 
In that same period, the state’s oil and gas industry paid an average of roughly $1.2 billion each year in production taxes, according to state figures. 
“Essentially, Alaska is subsidizing a huge giveaway of its public resources,” an economist wrote in a 2022 report commissioned by the mining watchdog group SalmonState.
Mining boosters and some economists say simply comparing state revenue from oil production and that from mining can be misleading, given the huge scale and high profit margins of the petroleum industry. They also note that the value of Alaska’s oil and gas pumped from state land, where production is subject to royalties, dwarfs that of minerals mined from state land. 
“Our world class oil fields — Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk — are in fundamentally a different category,” said Dan Stickel, chief economist at the state’s revenue department.

The market value of all the minerals produced in the state last year was roughly $4 billion, according to state estimates — though mining advocates say that number overstates actual value because mines sell the concentrate they produce at lower prices than pure metals. The total market value of oil produced on the North Slope was about $14 billion. 
Even if the state raised taxes on mining companies, economists have long said the industry isn’t large or lucrative enough to make up for Alaska’s decades-long decline in oil revenue.
But the recurring question of whether miners should pay more has bubbled up again recently, with calls from newspaper publishers and environmental advocates to tweak the state’s mining tax and royalty policies to generate more income for Alaskans.
These suggestions have not translated into any formal proposals from elected officials. But they come as record gold prices promise to boost some of Alaska’s biggest mines, as more businesses apply for permits to mine in Alaska and as the state government navigates an ominous financial outlook.
The state uses a few tools to generate income from mining. 
It levies a severance tax on minerals, called the mining license tax. It takes 3% in royalties from mining profits on state land. It rents mineral claims and leases. And, like other businesses, mining companies pay corporate income tax. 
State agencies brought in an average of $90 million from those sources and various other taxes and fees, such as tolls on a state-owned ore haul road, each year between 2016 and 2021, according to state data. 
That’s a fraction of the more than $2.5 billion in annual revenue that mining companies averaged during that period, according to state estimates. 
Last year, the Red Dog zinc mine in Northwest Alaska reported more than $600 million in gross profits; Fort Knox, the state’s biggest gold mine, reported more than $300 million in profits after deducting operating expenses, according to corporate financial disclosures.
Proposals to generate more state revenue have focused on raising production royalties and overhauling the mining license tax — a maximum 7% levy on profits that hasn’t changed since 1955. 
For large mines, the license tax is currently a $4,000 payment, plus 7% of net income over $100,000. New mines get a 3.5-year exemption. 
By contrast, the state taxes oil at a base rate of 35% of net production value — the value of the oil produced minus certain capital and operating expenses — with tax credits that increase when oil prices fall.
Without knowing the taxable income of each mine and oil operation and exactly how much each owes in taxes — numbers that aren’t disclosed publicly — it’s difficult to compare the effective tax rate across each industry. The effective rate is the percentage of a company’s profits that it pays in taxes, and it’s a figure that economists often use to describe a company’s tax burden.
A recent report on mining policy commissioned by the Alaska Conservation Foundation recommended restructuring the mining license tax so that it applies to a company’s overall income rather than being tied to profitability.
“We’re just giving away these precious metals and allowing these multinational corporations to dig them up,” said Dan Cannon, senior public lands coordinator at the Anchorage-based conservation organization. “What does the average Alaskan get from this? Not much.”
If the state kept the maximum rate at 7%, but taxed gross instead of net income, that would be a “very large tax increase,” according to Stickel, the state economist. 
The state’s most recent revenue forecast assumes about $3.6 billion in gross mining income during the next fiscal year. Its forecast of $36.7 million in revenue from the existing, profit-based tax structure, would be similar, roughly speaking, to a tax on gross income at around 1%, Stickel said.
Even if revenue stayed steady, a gross income tax “would be more regressive – with tax due even when a mine is unprofitable and with a lower tax burden when there is higher income,” Stickel wrote. “What impact this structure would have on production and company decisionmaking is difficult to say.” 
Industry representatives say raising taxes would make Alaska less attractive to miners and would thwart investment, potentially leading to decreased revenue in the long term.
“Alaska’s mining record does not show that we are a jurisdiction widely viewed as a low-tax environment where industry is flocking to invest,” trade group Alaska Metal Mines wrote in a recent paper responding to the report commissioned by the conservation foundation. “This is not a record that supports a significant increase in revenue obligations for the industry.” 
A tax hike could make new mines too expensive to build and operating mines too costly to expand and keep in production, said Karen Matthias, director of Alaska Metal Mines. Costs are already higher in Alaska than other states because of its remoteness and lack of infrastructure, she added.

	In the past four years, Alaska’s annual mining license tax revenue ranged from more than $50 million to a loss of about $1 million. That loss, reported during the 2024 fiscal year, was caused by a shift in the timing of one-time tax filings and refunds, as well as by low base metal prices and high operating costs caused by inflation, according to Stickel. 
Rents and royalties are a smaller fraction of Alaska’s mining related income and have recently amounted to just over $15 million in yearly revenue. Corporate income tax paid to the state by mining companies has averaged some $7 million over each of the past five years.
In all, mining accounted for just 0.2% of the state’s total revenue last year — a proportion that state officials expect to double this year.
With gold prices soaring, the revenue department forecasts mining license tax revenue to see a modest boost from the recent average of $28.5 million — reaching about $33 million this fiscal year and $36 million the following year. 
The state won’t see a bigger bump because costs have gone up across the industry and not all metal prices are rising like gold’s, Stickel said. 
Zinc prices, for instance, have fallen about 8% this year, potentially cutting into profits at Red Dog mine, a pillar of the state’s industry.
That mine also is often cited by industry supporters as an example of how mining stands out more for its impact on local and regional economies than on the state government.  
Red Dog accounts for more than 80% of the Northwest Arctic Borough’s revenue through payments similar to taxes. It has also generated billions of dollars for shareholders of the Alaska Native corporation that owns the land where the mine sits, which receives a 40% royalty share of net profits. 
Similarly, large mines are the biggest property taxpayers in the Juneau and Fairbanks areas.
“Where mining truly makes a difference in Alaska is regionally,” Matthias said. “Red Dog is to the Northwest Arctic Borough what the entire oil industry is to the state.”

Tim Walz on Wednesday night delivered his seventh state of the state address, cleverly using the state’s grim budget outlook to paint himself as the man in the middle, ready to bring lawmakers to a compromise in the fashion of his long ago campaign slogan, One Minnesota.
Walz also used the address to hammer President Donald Trump and his sometimes sidekick Elon Musk, attacking what Walz called the “chaos and destruction” they’ve unleashed on the federal government. In the process, Walz continues to keep his name in the mix of national Democratic leaders who will stand up to the Trump administration and maybe take a shot at the White House in 2028. 
Walz, who says he’ll announce whether he’ll run for a third term after the legislative session, spoke for about 22 minutes in the well of the Minnesota House. 
Here are some key takeaways:
It’s good to have a foil
Walz spent four years as a good soldier defending the unpopular and infirm President Joe Biden and then as the vice presidential nominee on the losing Kamala Harris ticket.
Walz is now able to deflect criticism of his own tenure by launching broadsides against Trump, whom he pummeled for his tariffs, immigration policies and Musk’s shambolic gutting of critical federal services. Walz emphasized that the federal chaos has been done knowingly and on purpose.
Walz said Trump isn’t a leader.
“That isn’t servant leadership. It’s not any kind of leadership. It’s small, it’s weak and it’s petty. It takes the awesome power of the federal government and turns it into a crude weapon, wielded by a man who wants to be king,” Walz said.
Walz said Minnesota leaders will need to rebuild the government from the ashes after Trump leaves office, and “these small, petty men will disappear into the dustbin of history.”
Three simple words that can be the architecture of a 2028 run
Democrats have struggled for eons to explain to Americans who they are and the direction they want to take the country. Walz sought to boil it down with a message that he can take on the road to Iowa diners and New Hampshire barrooms. 
“Security. Opportunity. Freedom. I hear it everywhere I go. And every time I do, I find myself feeling proud of Minnesota,” Walz said.
He used the phrase to argue that Democrats delivered all three during their two years of trifecta rule: a child tax credit, enhanced labor rights, a tax cut on Social Security benefits for the majority of Minnesotans and a paid leave program that will launch in January.
Democrats loudly cheered and stood in support of their victory lap, but the line from Walz that got the biggest applause from Democrats was about freedom:
“If you say you love freedom, but you don’t believe freedom is for everybody, then the thing you love isn’t freedom — it’s privilege,” Walz said.
Walz tempers state budget expectations
The governor has proposed slowing state spending on disability services to address Minnesota’s looming multi-billion dollar deficit. He defended his position, arguing that lawmakers of years past had “put us on a path of unsustainable growth.”
Numerous disability rights advocates have criticized Walz’s proposal to slow spending growth, arguing that services will be cut and workers harmed. Walz said those who need care will be served. 
“This budget was not written to please everyone. It was written to bring everyone to the table,” Walz said. 
The governor also touted his sales tax proposal, which would broaden the tax to include legal and financial services while lowering the rate.  
“I’m proposing an unprecedented tax cut for working people – a reduction in the statewide sales tax.”
Walz’s plan would cut the sales tax .075%, which would save Minnesotans 75 cents for every $1,000 they spend on taxable goods and services.
Co-opting an anti-fraud message
Republicans have spent the legislative session highlighting recent high-profile cases of fraud in public programs. Walz won the loudest — and most bipartisan — cheers of the night when he discussed combating fraud. 
“The truth is, as long as there have been programs aimed at helping people, there have been people looking to steal from those who need them most,” Walz said. “We’ve made strides in catching those bad actors, stopping their schemes. We’ve sent a lot of crooks to prison.”
(The federal government has done the bulk of the work holding fraudsters accountable in Minnesota.) 
At times, Walz’s own government was slow to respond to fraud. Even as the number of autism treatment providers and spending on the program exploded, Walz’s own Department of Human Services told the Reformer last year that this was no cause for alarm. The FBI late last year raided two autism treatment providers armed with search warrants.  
“Bottom line: I believe that when criminals try to steal public funding, you don’t cut the funding, you stop the criminals. And that’s exactly what we do,” Walz said.
‘An angry rant about Donald Trump’
Republican legislative leaders criticized the governor for focusing on problems in Washington, arguing Minnesota needs to address its own issues.
“Minnesota has to be our first priority,” said House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring.
Republican House Floor Leader Harry Niska, R-Ramsey, said that Walz’s speech played well for the Democratic base, but Walz failed to take responsibility for Minnesota’s grim budget outlook.
“It was really unfortunate that while there was not quite an olive branch, but maybe a few buds from an olive tree, given by the governor, most of it was overshadowed by (an) angry rant about Donald Trump, and I don’t think that that serves the state of Minnesota,” Niska said.
Republicans again criticized Democrats for spending the 2023-24 budget surplus  — which arose from generous federal contributions to the states, and robust tax collections — and wreaking havoc on the medium-term fiscal outlook. 
If Walz was at times playing to a national Democratic audience with his hits on Trump, he’s right about the primacy of the federal government in Minnesota’s budget. In 2024, Minnesota spent $18.5 billion on Medicaid, of which $11 billion — 60% — was federal funding. Which means that depending on what happens in Washington — especially if Republicans follow through on plans to cut Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars — Walz and Minnesota lawmakers may find themselves back in St. Paul in an emergency special session to deal with the fallout later this year.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MG_9261-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-24 00:01:57.172444

(File photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Senators advanced a spending plan Wednesday that would give themselves a pay raise, threaten to take money back from the city of Columbia, and keep lottery tickets cash-only.
The $14.4 billion spending plan approved by the Senate on a 41-2 vote was largely similar to the version passed by the House in March.
Both plans include a $1,500 pay raise in the minimum salary for teachers, a 2% raise for the state’s lowest-paid employees and completion of the Legislature’s 2022 law that phased in income tax cuts.
“It’s a good budget that funds the core functions of government,” Senate Finance Chairman Harvey Peeler, R-Gaffney, told reporters soon after the budget passed.
Sen. Tom Fernandez, R-Summerville, and Sen. Margie Bright Matthews, D-Walterboro, were the two to vote against the spending package as a whole.
Bright Matthews’ vote came after a speech in which she called the process a dictatorship with little transparency. In particular, she railed against Peeler’s decision not to fund any of legislators’ requests for local projects, known as earmarks, saying that would hurt the poor, rural parts of her district.
“The struggling ones are those rural counties, where they need every cent they can get,” Bright Matthews said.
Spending had gotten “totally out of hand” in the last few years, Peeler said, so he decided to pause the whole process to rein it in.
The local spending topped $430 million last year, falling from the high of $713 million in 2023.
By the next budget process, he hopes to have a grant process in which communities can apply for the money, he said.
“It was best to stop cold turkey,” Peeler said.
The budget isn’t finished yet. The Senate’s vote sent the plan back to the House, which will adjust its initial proposal before the two chambers work out their differences. Spending that’s the same in each plan, such as the teacher raises, won’t change. Those amounts are locked in ahead of negotiations.
Spending increase
One of the few amendments approved Wednesday would give every legislator an $18,000 pay raise.
By a vote of 24-15, senators voted to increase legislators’ monthly allotment for “in-district compensation” from $1,000 to $2,500 — in other words, from $12,000 to $30,000 annually.
That’s in addition to their salaries of $10,400 a year, which hasn’t changed since 1990, and their stipends for meals and mileage for one round trip weekly to the Statehouse.
The $1,000 stipend, which is technically meant for their legislative duties but can be spent on anything, hasn’t changed since 1995.
Legislators are generally unwilling to give themselves a raise as it can backfire politically. The last time they tried was 2014, when then-Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the attempted $1,000 raise, and senators sustained her veto without discussion.
But a raise is needed to keep up with inflation, said Sen. Shane Martin, a Pauline Republican who co-sponsored the amendment.
With 170 members of the Legislature receiving that monthly stipend, the change would cost the state an additional $3 million a year.
Peeler was among senators voting against it.
“I just didn’t personally feel like we needed that,” he said.
Conversion therapy
Another clause inserted in the budget Wednesday threatens to revoke $3.5 million from South Carolina’s capital city if it doesn’t repeal its ban on so-called conversion therapy.
Since June 2021, a Columbia city ordinance has threatened a $500 fine for attempting to alter a juvenile’s gender identity or sexual orientation through counseling. It’s unclear if anyone has been fined under that rule.
While the budget clause adopted by senators applies broadly to any city in South Carolina, only Columbia has such an ordinance.
The Senate vote came a day after Attorney General Alan Wilson sent a letter to the Columbia City Council asking its members to repeal the ordinance to “avoid any future legal action.”
His letter pointed to a 2022 state law that says only the state can license and regulate medical fields, to include social workers and counselors. The law barred local governments from passing their own restrictions.
He contends the ordinance also violates First Amendment freedoms of speech and religion by telling counselors they can’t offer faith-based guidance but rather must affirm a patient’s gender.
“This ordinance crosses the line, violates the law, and must be repealed,” Wilson said in a statement.
Wilson asked city officials to respond by May 5. His letter came after he co-led a coalition of Republican attorneys general trying to overturn Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors.
Senators took the approach of threatening to yank money from the city.
If the clause ends up in the final budget and city officials don’t change the ordinance, the city stands to lose its $3.5 million share of state aid distributed to cities and counties statewide, according to the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
“You run afoul of the First Amendment, you tell people they can’t have an opinion and force conformity to ideological position, then there should be consequences,” said Sen. Josh Kimbrell, a Spartanburg Republican who proposed the clause and questioned the initial ordinance.
Sen. Tameika Isaac Devine, a Columbia Democrat who voted for the ordinance when she was on Columbia City Council, argued the budget clause would infringe on a local government’s right to conduct its own business.
But her protests using Senate rules failed, and the amendment passed.
Debit cards and lottery tickets
Not included in the Senate’s spending proposal was a clause included in the House plan that would allow people to buy lottery tickets using debit cards. That part of the budget was thrown out for attempting to change permanent state law through a one-year budget.
Under existing law, lottery players can pay for tickets with cash only. It was a restriction gambling opponents insisted on when the Legislature created the lottery in 2001.
Gov. Henry McMaster recommended changing that in his executive budget proposal, saying adding debit cards would be necessary to continue funding college financial aid.
Allowing debit card sales could increase lottery revenue, which funds college scholarships, by about $52 million annually, according to estimates by the state Lottery Commission, which has been pushing for the change for years.
Tuition freeze
Unlike the House, the Senate again blocked colleges from raising tuition for in-state students.
The House spending plan would allow the state’s universities to raise tuition for incoming students, so long as they lock in that tuition for the rest of their time at the school.
College presidents told legislators keeping tuition stagnant, as they have done for more than five years, is unsustainable. Unable to increase tuition for in-state students, colleges looking to keep up with rising costs will have to continue raising prices for out-of-state students, potentially eventually pricing them out, college presidents told a House panel earlier this year.
Senate budget writers would give universities $55 million, which is slightly more than the House plan, though still nowhere near the $130 million schools collectively requested to offset tuition raises.
The committee responsible for the higher education portion of the budget was “trying to keep our costs down for all of our young people who want to attend a secondary education,” said Sen. Ronnie Cromer, the Prosperity Republican who leads that subcommittee.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Peeler-and-Martin-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-04-23 22:59:44.112992

Jim Pillen enacted an emergency declaration and statewide burn ban Wednesday amid serious drought conditions and a raging wildfire in north-central Nebraska.
The “Plum Creek Fire” was 0% contained and had burned 6,631 acres and one cabin (a secondary residence), killed 45 cattle and destroyed at least eight utility poles, as of Wednesday afternoon.
Pillen addressed the fire from the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Lincoln and signed the burn ban and other proclamations related to the fire. What began Monday afternoon as a controlled burn approved by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission got out of control, he and others said.

More than 50 different local fire departments, many run by volunteers, have responded, as have the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, NEMA, State Fire Marshal’s Office, Nebraska National Guard, Nebraska State Patrol, Game and Parks and Nebraska Forest Service.
‘It’s way too dry’
Pillen declared an emergency for the fire and, citing drought conditions, issued the burn ban through April. About 33.62% of the state is in “severe drought” conditions. The vast majority of the rest of the state is in “moderate” drought conditions, with a sliver of “extreme” drought conditions up in the northwestern corner of the state.
“It’s way too dry, and it doesn’t make any sense,” Pillen told reporters. “It only takes one burn, one mistake, and the one that took place yesterday really, really made no sense.”
He continued: “We need Mother Nature to get on our side, and we need to get drenched. We need a tsunami. So if Nebraskans want to pray for a tsunami, I think we’d take that, right, or a drenching rain.”

John Erixson, director of the Nebraska Forest Service, said it is an unusual year for wildfires, including fires at the end of February brought on by a lack of moisture in the winter and a lack of soil moisture, coupled with dry snow.
“It just takes one little spark from any source to take off,” Erixson said.
A challenging response
Erv Portis, assistant director of NEMA, said the fire is in “very, very challenging topography” between canyons, hills and water on the northern edge. The only real way to fight it, he said, is from the air.
Roughly 16,000 gallons of retardant have been dropped on the area, as has about 50,000 gallons of water by two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from the Nebraska National Guard.
Col. Shane Varejcka, chief of the joint staff for the National Guard, said Ainsworth and Valentine have helped provide service members — 19 Army National Guard and 10 Air National Guard — with lodging, food and other support.
“We’re doing all we can. We’re still not getting containment,” Col. Shane Varejcka, chief of the joint staff for the National Guard, said. “We’ll keep fighting, keep doing the things that need to be done.”

Pillen said he’s confident that officials will get the fire under control, but he said that even half an inch of rain isn’t enough. He said Nebraskans need to use “good common sense” to help.
‘Safety must come first’
Director Sherry Vinton of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Laura Field of the Nebraska Cattlemen and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, all ranchers, as well as Pillen, whose family owns a major hog farming operation, said they understand that some Nebraskans might have concerns about the burn ban, but they said it is critical.
The alternative is diverting resources and personnel, they said, which interim State Fire Marshal Doug Hohbein said are already being stretched thin this early in the season.
Vinton said protecting land, livestock, wildlife and people is of the “utmost importance.”
“While fire is a tool that we use in our agricultural operations and for conservation, right now our current donations make it just too dangerous,” Vinton said. “Safety must come first.”
Finding help and future updates

Storer, who represents the largest geographic legislative district that includes the fire response area and much of north-central Nebraska, said her constituents are friends and neighbors. This early in the year, many of the volunteer firefighters who are in the livestock industry are in the calving season and already exhausted.
She expressed gratitude for their continued sacrifices, as did Vinton, Erixson, Pillen and others.
For anyone needing support, Storer said constituents shouldn’t hesitate to reach out. She plans to go look at the damage soon.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Five days after Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed a major increase to Alaska’s per-student public school funding formula, a Senate committee has proposed a smaller increase.
On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee amended a bill related to regulating cell phones in schools by adding a $700 increase to the base student allocation, core of the K-12 per-student funding formula.
The amended version of House Bill 57 remains in committee, which means it could be further amended to include policy changes advocated by the governor. It could also be advanced to a vote of the full Senate without further changes.
Policy differences between Dunleavy and legislators have repeatedly derailed efforts to permanently increase Alaska public school funding.
On Wednesday, Dunleavy reacted on social media, repeating his call for education policy changes in any school funding bill. “This bill is essentially a money only bill,” he said.” While this new bill currently does not have needed policy, there is still time to reach a compromise agreement that includes meaningful reforms. Once again, a bill that only increases funding without policy improvements is not something that I, or most Alaskans, can support.”
On Thursday, Dunleavy vetoed House Bill 69, which would have permanently increased the BSA by $1,000 to $6,960, raising the base level of state education funding by $253 million. On Tuesday, lawmakers failed to override the governor’s veto.
Dunleavy has introduced new legislation, House Bill 204, which would provide a $560 BSA increase plus an additional $35 million for specific programs and focus on his policy priorities, particularly for charter schools and homeschool programs. The bill was assigned to the House Finance Committee, but has not yet been scheduled to be heard. 
Last year, lawmakers and Dunleavy authorized $174 million in one-time bonus funding on top of the BSA, meaning that HB 69 would have represented an $79 million year-over-year increase.
Members of the Senate majority declined to make a definitive statement about their plans for HB 57.
“We are negotiating with the other body right now,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, referring to the House. “It’ll come out in the wash.”
Rep. Zack Fields, D-Anchorage and the author of HB 57, said he supports the $700 increase. He said the amount is insufficient, but a step forward in providing financial stability for school districts. “We need to restore a meaningful amount of funding within the BSA formula that has been lost to inflation over the last decade. $700 is obviously insufficient,” he said.
To match inflation since 2011, the BSA would have to be increased by more than $1,800. Fields said that’s far from what’s been proposed in the new amendment. “It’s about one third of the funding that’s been lost,” he said. “But we have an extremely challenging administration, so this is what it takes to have folks override a veto and provide a degree of stability for the next year, plus, then that’s what we have to do.”
Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, expressed frustration in legislators putting forward another education funding bill without some of the governor’s priority policy changes, at risk of another veto. “Are we just going to throw a BSA (increase) in there with no policy?” he said. “Then we’re going to be in the same boat in the summertime when the governor vetoes it out of the budget, right? I mean, that’s really frustrating to me.” 
Cronk said he hoped to see additional policy changes added to the bill. “I’m hoping they did this to say, ‘Hey, we have something we can work on,’ before the end of the year, you know, 30 days,” he said, referring to the May 21 deadline to end the legislative session. “Being an optimist, I guess.”
Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, and another Senate Finance committee member, echoed a similar frustration. “Doing these fake victory laps on passing something out (of the Legislature) when you know that it’s going to die from a veto — you’ve got to just quit doing that,” he said. “And just come to an agreement.”
Kaufman said he remains hopeful an agreement can be reached with the governor. 
“I just hope there’s room to do something realistic that can be durable,” he said. “He’s got the stick there. People need to come up with the carrots that’ll allow him to accept the legislation that we put out.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-24 01:48:58+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers challenge Lamont to tax rich to pay for child tax credit,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/23/ct-child-tax-credit-tax-rich-capital-gains/,The finance committee proposed a 1.75% surcharge on capital gains earnings on individuals making over $1 million and couples over $2 million.,"A key legislative panel endorsed a new $150-per-child state income tax credit Wednesday for middle class families, alongside a temporary income tax surcharge on wealthy households to ensure the relief won’t vanish if cuts in federal aid push state finances into distress.
The complementary proposals advanced Wednesday by the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee set the stage for a showdown among Gov. Ned Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority as they try to negotiate a new state budget before the session ends June 4.
The committee, which wrapped work Wednesday on the bills it raised, also approved business tax changes expected to generate about $175 million in new yearly revenue, revised budget caps to shield core state programs from impending cuts in federal aid, scrapped a proposal to withhold driver’s licenses from delinquent taxpayers, endorsed new borrowing to help cut electric bills and advanced Gov. Ned Lamont’s plan to use expanded hospital taxes to leverage more aid from Washington.
“We shouldn’t sit here and pretend we are living in ordinary times. We are not,” said Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the finance committee. “We are watching as funds that protect our most vulnerable residents get slashed daily.”
President Donald J. Trump already has used executive orders to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Connecticut for public health, addiction, education and other programs. 
And Congress has set a target of achieving $880 billion in reductions to the national budget, cuts projected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of additional dollars in yearly aid at best, billions at worst.
A tax break for middle-class families, a capital gains surcharge for the rich
“We have a responsibility as policymakers to make sure that the have-nots have something,” said Rep. Patricia Miller, D-Stamford.
State government will try to mitigate some of the cutbacks triggered by federal budget decisions, but legislators said Connecticut families need more money.
The linchpin of the Democrat-controlled finance committee’s tax package involves a new $150-per-child credit, $450 maximum per household, for single parents earning up to $100,000 per year and couples earning up to $200,000, starting with 2026 earnings.
The credit then would be gradually phased out. For every $1,000 earned above those thresholds, households would lose 10% of the credit’s value.
Democratic legislators, who’ve been pushing for a child tax credit for the past four years, opted to advance this proposal rather than Lamont’s plan to increase another middle-class income tax credit. The governor in February proposed boosting a credit that offsets a portion of local property tax bills from $300 to $350.
But legislators also were worried about forfeiting the $83 million annually that nonpartisan analysts project it would cost the state to offer the child tax credit.
The finance committee amended its revenue plan during Wednesday’s debate, adding a temporary 1.75% surcharge on the capital gains earnings of individuals whose overall income exceeds $1 million and on couples topping $2 million. The surcharge would be applied through 2029 and then expire and would include a one-time exception for the sale of residential and business property.
Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, the committee’s other co-chair, said legislators didn’t want to punish families and individuals who planned to sell their home or business to finance their retirement.
Fonfara added analysts projected the capital gains surcharge — before legislators added the one-time exceptions for home and business sales — would generate $284 million per year in revenue. Legislators did not have an updated revenue estimate that includes those exceptions.
Democrats on the finance committee narrowly adopted this capital gains surcharge proposal over a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats by a 27-21 tally.
Rep. Joe Polletta of Watertown, ranking House Republican on Finance, charged Democrats with having only one approach toward solving budget challenges.
“It’s always a tax,” he said. “What if we look at some reductions?”
The Watertown lawmaker noted that General Electric cited 2015 state tax hikes shortly before announcing plans to move its Fairfield headquarters to Boston the following year, adding that if “businesses have left, high earners can easily leave.”
Rep. Jill Barry, a Glastonbury Democrat, said, “Now is not the time to be raising taxes” before reminding her colleagues of Lamont’s oft-used assertion that Connecticut “needs more taxpayers, not more taxes.”
Lamont has said boosting state taxes on the rich would prompt them to flee Connecticut and has consistently blocked efforts to do so in recent years.
“Increasing taxes won’t help our state grow — which is also a priority for the governor,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said late Wednesday. “While it’s early in the process, we look forward to working together to pass an honest budget that reflects the needs of our state today and builds a better tomorrow.”
Blanchard also noted that, “Over the last several years, Connecticut has managed to turn its fiscal house around, while cutting taxes for working families and the middle class.”
But given the huge impending cuts in federal aid, Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, an advocate for a more progressive state tax system, proposed several options this year to collect more from Connecticut’s top earners through income or property taxes.
The Senate leader noted last week that Congress is slashing aid to states to finance an extension of 2017 federal income tax cuts, a move that would chiefly benefit households making more than $320,000 annually.
“If Washington insists on handing billionaires another tax break, we will ensure some of that windfall comes back to the people of Connecticut to help deal with the massive federal cuts we anticipate,” Looney said.
Changing CT’s savings habits
The finance committee also advanced another proposal likely to spark a showdown with Lamont. The group endorsed changes to the series of budget caps Connecticut has followed since 2017 that would set aside $700 million to mitigate the anticipated loss in federal aid.
These “fiscal guardrails,” as supporters call them, have generated annual surpluses of $1.8 billion in their first seven years. Another $1.8 billion cushion is projected for the current year. 
These surpluses represent 8% of the General Fund, a significant share that critics say has leached too many dollars from education, health care, child care and other core programs.
Several groups, from across the political spectrum, are expected to press Lamont on this.
“Growing economic uncertainties mean that it is harder than ever for ​households with children to keep a solid footing in their budget,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way’s Connecticut chapter, which reported last fall that about 40% of Connecticut families lived in poverty in 2022. “Moving this forward shows to families that their elected leaders are hearing them, feel their pain, and are willing to take proven, common-sense measures to help our families and their kids.”
Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations, said “Connecticut’s families are holding their breath as they wait to see whether or not our state elected officials prioritize working families over the profits of billionaires and corporations.”
The Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a conservative policy group, launched an online petition this spring urging the governor to leave the budget controls alone.
Bill to lower electric bills advances, plan to block tax delinquents from driving dropped
In other action Wednesday, the finance committee voted overwhelmingly to advance a proposal by Fonfara to borrow $2.4 billion over the next three years to pay for the costs associated with the controversial public benefits charge that appears on customers’ electric bills. That charge would be removed during those three years, cutting bills by an average of 20%.
The vote followed a lengthy closed-door caucus of majority Democrats on the committee. Once the meeting resumed, Fonfara alluded somewhat to the source of the delay: he said he had been called a “disrupter” earlier by one of his colleagues, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who serves as co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee. Last week, Needleman voiced his frustration that Fonfara’s bill had not appeared before that committee, given its focus on electricity costs.
While Fonfara said he agreed with the label, he said that his legislation, Senate Bill 1560, “was in no way intended to step on anyone’s toes or to be disrespectful.”
Needleman himself said that he appreciated Fonfara’s knowledge and work on the issue Wednesday and voted to advance the bill with the understanding that it would be referred to the Energy and Technology Committee for further deliberations. 
The committee also abandoned a proposal to block tax delinquents from renewing their driver’s licenses or motor vehicle registrations until all obligations are met. Those who lost their license could apply for a special permit to drive, for limited hours, to attend work or receive medical treatment.
That measure also would have allowed the state to use private collection agencies to pursue tax delinquents.
The Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer Advocate Service reported to Congress in 2017 that about 44% of all taxpayers targeted by private collection agencies on behalf of the IRS “are at risk of economic hardship.” And the median income of households targeted by collection agencies that later entered into installment agreements to repay their debt was $38,021 per year.
Hospital tax changes hinge on federal budget debate
The committee also endorsed Lamont’s plan to increase the hospital provider tax by $140 million per year, which also involves boosting state payments back to the industry by a matching amount.
This back-and-forth arrangement, which has been encouraged by the federal government and employed by most states, would enable Connecticut to qualify for an extra $94 million in federal Medicaid payments.
But with Congress looking to slash $880 billion in spending — which analysts say couldn’t be achieved without deep reductions to Medicaid — Lamont’s proposal may now wait in political limbo for months until the fiscal picture from Washington becomes clear.

(Photo courtesy of Legislative Support Services)Republican lawmakers walked out of a committee meeting in the Washington Legislature on Wednesday to protest approval of a bill that would close a residential center for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
“We voted no on the bill first and, when it was apparent that the bill was going to pass, we were upset and we just decided to leave,” said Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the top GOP lawmaker on the House Appropriations Committee. 
Senate Bill 5393, which the committee voted out Wednesday, aims to close the Rainier School in Pierce County and relocate its residents by June 30, 2027. House Bill 1472 calls for the closure of both the Rainier School and the Yakima Valley School in Selah.
Republicans say the centers are crucial for people with ​​intellectual and developmental disabilities, providing paths to educational and employment opportunities. And they say that there are limited options for where people could end up if these closures occur.
But Democrats say the facilities are expensive to operate and that closing them could allow for resources to be shifted in a way that gives people improved options for services.
‘Failing pretty horrifically’
The “residential habilitation centers,” operated by the state’s Department of Social and Health Services, have also faced scrutiny in recent years. 
Groups like Disability Rights Washington have documented extensive problems with abuse, neglect, and safety lapses. The group and other advocates for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have called for the centers to be closed. 
“Washington is one of the states that had the highest investment in folks with intellectual and developmental disabilities, yet with the poorest outcomes,” said Rep. Darya Farivar, D-Seattle. 
“When the RHCs were built, they were intended to be short-term placements,” Farivar said. “The intent was not for these to be permanent placements, and so the facilities we are using, the level of care that we are using, is failing pretty horrifically for these individuals.” 
She also explained how the Rainier School is in an isolated location, compared to Fircrest School, in Shoreline, which allows residents greater access to the surrounding community. A new 120-bed facility is under construction at Fircrest, Farivar later noted in an email.
Including the Rainier and Yakima Valley schools, the state operates four residential habilitation centers. An analysis of the Senate bill says that the Rainier School has 58 long-term residents. 
Farivar said she wants people to have the choice between a residential habilitation center and living in housing in the broader community, with support services. 
Both Fircrest and Lakeland Village, near Spokane, have the capacity to house more people and can provide services at a lower cost than the Rainier School, Farivar said. “At $775,625 per person annually, Rainier is the most expensive care setting in the state,” she wrote in the email.
Farivar said she and others are pressing to ensure there’s funding in the budget for the staff needed at Fircrest and Lakeland Village so people can transition out of the Rainier School. 
‘Grind the brakes off of this place’
But Couture said closing the Rainier School would raise the odds of people with disabilities ending up in hospitals, jails, or living on the streets without access to care. 
And, he said, “the amount of abuse and neglect that happens in community care settings is just as great, if not greater, than what has ever happened at some of these RHC facilities.” 
Couture said that if the bill to close the Rainier School makes it to the House floor for a vote, Republicans “will grind the brakes off of this place and do every procedural motion in the book, we will throw the kitchen sink at defeating this. It has to stop.” 
He derided the bill as the “most cruel and disgusting” one introduced this year.
The walkout after the House Appropriations Committee vote was not pre-planned, according to Couture, but rather a decision after Republican committee members became frustrated. “Most of us had tears in our eyes and there’s only just so much you can put up with,” Couture said. 
It is unclear when the House could take up the bill for a floor vote. Only a short time is left until the session is scheduled to end on Sunday, April 27.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/35591982_web1_WEB-240229-OVG-WNPA-Holocoust-Ed-Bill-09.jpg,,,2025-04-23 22:01:10.852580

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A major mining company is pulling out of Western Alaska’s Donlin Gold project, selling most of its shares to a U.S. billionaire with a history of investing in gold.
Barrick Gold Corp., a Canadian company that operates in 18 countries, said Tuesday it is selling its 50% share in Donlin Gold for about $1 billion. Under the deal, Novagold Resources Inc., the smaller Canadian mining company that has been Barrick’s Donlin partner, will add another 10% share of the project’s ownership to its current 50% share, while an investment company headed by billionaire John Paulson will wind up with a 40% share in the project. Paulson’s company was already a major Novagold shareholder.
The deal is expected to close at about midyear, Barrick said.
In dual statements, the companies said the sale is mutually beneficial.
In its statement about the deal, Novagold praised Paulson’s expertise and said the ownership change will help move the project forward.
“For myriad reasons, Paulson is quite literally the finest partner we could have hoped for. The embodiment of ‘smart money,’ John has been recognized as having a unique ability to identify the right vehicle to execute legendary trades. John and his team’s expertise and counsel will be invaluable as we work to advance Donlin Gold through feasibility and financing,” Novagold Chairman Thomas Kaplan said in the company’s statement.
Paulson, also quoted in the statement, called Donlin “one of the most attractive development gold projects in the world.”
“With 39 million ounces of gold at double the industry average grade, and an optimal location in the prime jurisdiction of Alaska — already the second largest gold-producing state in the United States — we believe that the project could create value for decades to come,” he said in the statement.
Paulson has investments in other gold-mining companies, including International Tower Hill Mines Ltd., which is trying to develop a gold mine at Livengood, northwest of Fairbanks.
In its statement, Barrick said that by selling off its share in the Donlin project, it will be able to continue a strategic shift that includes more of a focus on copper.
“The Donlin agreement allows Barrick to exit the Donlin Gold Project at an attractive valuation, while allowing NOVAGOLD and Paulson to pursue the development of the project. This is a good example of an instance where an asset we own might be better suited in the hands of others, while we pursue our priority portfolio of Barrick-managed growth projects,” Mark Bristow, Barrick’s president and chief executive, said in the statement.
The Donlin project has been controversial in Western Alaska and elsewhere.
Supporters say it will bring important economic benefits to a region of the state that has long struggled with poverty. Supporters include the for-profit Native corporations that own the mineral rights and surface lands where the mine project is located: Calista Corp., owned by Yup’ik people of the Yukon-Kuskokwim region, and The Kuskokwim Corp., owned by people from 10 villages along the mid-Kuskokwim region. Those Native corporations are partners in Donlin and point out that revenues from the mine, if it starts operating, will be shared with Native corporations statewide under terms of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
Opponents, who include Yukon-Kuskokwim tribal members and Native corporation shareholders themselves, consider the mine to be a threat to the ecosystem and to the food resources and cultural practices that depend on it.
Tribal opponents have been fighting the mine in state and federal courts.
To opponents, Barrick’s sell-off is a sign of project trouble.
Sophie Swope, executive director of an anti-Donlin tribal coalition called Mother Kuskokwim, said Barrick’s sell-off is a sign of project trouble.
“The Donlin Gold Mine is a bad investment—plain and simple. It’s riddled with environmental, economic, operational, reputational, regulatory, and legal risks—and completely lacks a social license to operate,” Swope said in a statement.
She cited the mine’s planned 471-foot tailings dam, which has been a particular source of controversy, the potential for river contamination and the expected increase in disruptive barge traffic as some of the concerns.
While Donlin Gold has received key permits, final development decisions have not been made. The Toronto-based Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that there had been disagreements between Barrick and Novagold over how to proceed with Donlin.
The transaction leaves the Donlin project without a major partner with experience operating large producing mines. Novagold does have some operating experience, but it is spotty. It developed a mine near Nome, the Rock Creek Mine, but was able to operate it for only two months in 2008. During construction in 2007, two workers died at the site, and the company was later penalized for water pollution violations as well. The site was later acquired by the Bering Straits Native Corp., which completed reclamation in 2016, according to state officials. Last month, other assets from the property were sold off.
Another controversial Alaska mining project, the Pebble copper project in Southwest Alaska, also lost its major corporate partner. In 2013, Anglo American, one of the world’s largest mining companies, dropped out of the Pebble Limited Partnership, leaving Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. as the sole partner. In 2014, another major international mining company, Rio Tinto, also dropped out by donating its 19% Northern Dynasty shares to Bristol Bay regional nonprofits.
The Pebble project is limbo. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2023 invoked a provision in the Clean Water Act to bar federal permitting because of anticipated damages to salmon habitat. Northern Dynasty is trying to overturn that finding and has expressed optimism that the Trump administration will help revive the project.

Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, on Wednesday, April 23, 2025. (Photo by Emilia Otte/CT Mirror)Connecticut Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit Wednesday that is suing to block the Trump administration’s tariffs, which have rattled the markets and worried businesses and consumers about higher prices.
Connecticut is one of a dozen states challenging four of President Donald J. Trump’s executive orders, arguing that he does not have the authority to circumvent Congress and increase tariffs on most imports.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Tong called the tariffs “unlawful, unconstitutional and destructive.” He argued that under Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, only Congress is given the power to levy tariffs.
The lawsuit also argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate international trade during a “national emergency,” and which President Trump has cited as allowing him to enact the tariffs, does not provide a legitimate legal backing for Trump’s actions.
The executive orders include a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, a 145% tariff on China and a 10% tariff on countries worldwide. Trump has also promised reciprocal tariffs on a number of countries but paused most of them for 90 days.
The back-and-forth over the president’s tariff policy has left things in a state of flux, particularly amid a growing trade war with China. But Trump said Tuesday that a 145% rate on Chinese imports “will come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” Those comments, in part, led to a rise in global markets on Wednesday.
Trump said Wednesday afternoon from the Oval Office that he hasn’t brought down the high tariffs on China yet.
“I haven’t brought it down. I said it’s a high tariff, but I haven’t brought it down,” Trump said after signing executive orders on Wednesday. “It basically means China is not doing any business with us essentially because it’s a very high number.”
But U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said during the Wednesday press conference that even with the pauses on reciprocal tariffs, the new levies would hurt consumers and businesses.
“Ten percent [tariffs] still across the board — on our allies. On countries that make things we could never make: Bananas. Coffee. We’re not growing them in the United States,” said Blumenthal.
Blumenthal and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, who also joined Tong’s announcement on Wednesday, have been vocal opponents of the tariff policy and support bipartisan legislation that would allow Congress to regain authority on the issue.
Blumenthal touted this legislation, noting that it is supported by seven Democrats and seven Republicans. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has introduced similar legislation in the House.
The lawsuit alleges that states are going to face “increased costs when purchasing necessary equipment and supplies essential to their economies” as a result of the tariffs, an assumption echoed at the Wednesday press conference.
Tong and Blumenthal both cited research from the Yale Budget Lab estimating a loss of $4,900 per household as a result of the tariffs, with prices for clothing and shoes being particularly affected.
Courtney, whose district includes the General Dynamics Electric Boat plant that produces submarines for the U.S. Navy, said he was particularly concerned about how the tariffs would affect agreements with other countries.
He referenced Australia, which is part of a deal, along with the U.S. and the U.K., to build three Virginia class submarines.
“Right now, those same questions that are being asked in Canada are being asked in Australia about whether or not the U.S. is really an ally that they can rely on,” said Courtney.
Oregon’s attorney general filed the latest tariff lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade. So far, only attorneys general from Democratic-led states have joined.
That same court rejected a temporary restraining order requested by a group of small businesses that argued they would be immediately harmed by the tariffs. The judges ruled the tariffs can be left in place while the lawsuit continues in court.
Since the start of Trump’s tenure, Tong has been a part of numerous lawsuits challenging various executive orders and policies from the president. The most recent sued the administration for seeking to gut a handful of federal agencies that mediate labor disputes, provide funding for public libraries, museums and minority-owned businesses.
Connecticut Republican Party Chair Ben Proto said that by instituting the tariffs, Trump was doing exactly what he’d told voters he would do.
“ He said he was going to institute tariffs if he was elected, and he was pretty overwhelmingly elected. I know the Democrats don’t like to think he was overwhelmingly elected, but some 78 million people voted for him, knowing full well what he was going to do.”
Proto also criticized Tong, calling the lawsuit a waste of taxpayer dollars. He also said neither Tong, Blumenthal nor Murphy knew what the fallout would be from the tariffs.
“ I have no idea what the tariffs are going to do, and I think the issue is if you’re looking for an answer as to what they’re going to do in the next 10 minutes, I think that will be a very different answer than what they’re going to do in the next 10 months,” Proto said.
When asked specifically about what has been gained from the China tariffs, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the White House Wednesday that it is “ensuring the rest of the world knows that the United States of America is no longer going to be ripped off.” She said there are 18 proposals “on paper” from other countries to try and strike a trade deal.
Leavitt said to “have some patience and you will see” when pressed if the tariffs have worked.
Trump said Wednesday that tariff negotiations with multiple countries are “doing very well.” The president said his team is still working with other countries on potential deals. But if those don’t come to fruition, they will set new rates in the coming weeks.
“If we don’t have a deal with a company or a country, we’re going to set the tariff. That will happen over the next two or three weeks. We’ll be setting the number,” Trump said. “We’re dealing with a lot of countries right now.”

The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed Wednesday afternoon the first case of measles in the state.

The measles diagnosis involving an adult in far southern Illinois was confirmed through laboratory testing, according to a press release sent out by IDPH.

This is the only IDPH-confirmed case in the state.

“This is not considered an outbreak at this time. IDPH will update the public should there be any notable developments,” the release stated.

IDPH is working to identify potential locations of exposure, including the clinic in southern Illinois where the patient sought care, to see whether any other patients were exposed. Health workers were wearing masks and “are considered immune,” the release said.

There have been no reported cases of measles since an outbreak in Chicago in early 2024 that resulted in 67 cases.

The Centers for Disease Control reports 800 confirmed cases in 26 states: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Those numbers were updated last week, according to the CDC website.

IDPH has been monitoring an outbreak in New Mexico and Texas that has resulted in three deaths, including two children.

“The first reported cases of measles in Illinois in 2025 is a reminder to our Illinois residents that this disease can be prevented with up-to-date vaccinations,” IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra said. “With hundreds of cases being reported nationally, we have been working closely with our local public health and health care partners to prepare for any potential meals cases in Illinois.”

Two doses of measles/mumps/rubella vaccine are 97% effective in preventing measles, Vohra said.

Measles symptoms may take from seven to 21 days to emerge and include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Anyone exposed and not immune to measles should notify their local health department if they become symptomatic.

Those with measles symptoms should contact their health care provider by phone or email before going to their office, urgent care or hospital emergency room so special arrangements can be made to prevent further transmission.

IDPH unveiled a Measles Outbreak Simulator Dashboard to allow the public to find out the vaccination rate of schools so they can determine the risk of a child being exposed to measles if a case is introduced in their school.

Vaccination rates have dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic. The current secretary of the federal Health and Human Services Department, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has been on record as being opposed to vaccines, which health officials fear has influenced some parents to not have their children vaccinated.

The tension about property taxes is filtering into debates about other bills including a proposal to spend $250 million on a new women’s prison and another bill to allocate $6 million for sawmill revitalization.
Both proposals, however, advanced this week.
House Bill 833 would set aside money for a new prison, and in an interview Wednesday, sponsor and Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, said the women’s prison in Billings is well over capacity.
It houses 240 people, but he said Montana needs beds for at least 400, possibly 500.
“Unlike the men, we have no place to put them out of state,” he said, referring to a contract with CoreCivic that sends male inmates to prisons in Arizona and Mississippi.
Fitzpatrick said the bill includes a study the Department of Corrections will lead to determine a new location for a women’s prison — not excluding Billings or Deer Lodge, where the men’s prison is located, but not favoring them either, he said.
“It could be anywhere,” Fitzpatrick said.
He anticipates that study should be complete by the end of the calendar year, and a groundbreaking could take place in roughly a year. He said the current women’s prison likely would be eventually repurposed by the state.
On the Senate floor Tuesday, Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, said the female population with the Department of Corrections has been rising faster than the male population, and just one “relatively small” facility houses women in the state.
“There’s no option to contract with others for this population,” Esp said.
Esp said the waiting list for the women’s prison in Billings has about 85 people, and the facility is probably eight to 10 people over capacity.
“And they don’t turn over very fast,” Esp said.
The bill would allow the state to build a new facility, or a private contractor to do so and sell or lease it back to the state, Esp said.
Sen. Jeremy Trebas, R-Great Falls, said he acknowledged the problem, but he had a hard time spending so much money with property taxes yet to be resolved.
“We’re going to spend $250 million on prisons before we figure out what we’re going to do with property taxes,” said Trebas, who voted against the bill.
On a final 46-4 vote Wednesday, the Senate approved HB 833, including with support from all Billings legislators. The bill earlier passed the House 86-12, also with support from Billings legislators.
It is included in the governor’s budget.
Later the same day, the Senate also advanced a major property tax bill, House Bill 231, and the House advanced another one, Senate Bill 542, but both proposals still need to clear multiple votes to pass.
The Senate also approved House Bill 876, the Sawmill Revitalization Act, sponsored by Rep. Fitzpatrick and Rep. Connie Keogh, D-Missoula.
It passed 29-21 on Wednesday, and also raised questions about property tax bills.
The bill sets aside $6 million for loans with interest rates of a maximum 4% “to parties with the capacity to revitalize a closed sawmill and return it to commercial operation.”
Originally, the bill had given priority to sawmills that had closed in the 12 months before Jan. 1, 2025.
In March 2024, Pyramid Mountain Lumber announced it would close its Seeley Lake mill.
In the Senate Finance and Claims Committee, however, Esp proposed an amendment to strike that limitation, and the committee approved it.
On the Senate floor Tuesday, Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka, said in the 1970s, Montana had more than 50 operating mills, and it now has just five major ones.
In the last three years, mills closed in St. Regis and Seeley Lake, and Cuffe said the closures represent “major lost economic activity.”
Sen. Becky Beard, however, said the mill in Seeley Lake is pretty much dismantled, and it would take at least $40 million to get it up and running again, not just $6 million.
“There is not really anything left there except the shells of the buildings where the machinery was housed,” said Beard, R-Elliston, who voted against it.
Sen. Shane Morigeau, D-Missoula, said Montana has the lumber for the Seeley Lake mill, but it needs staffing, and the bill would help.
“We have people ready to come and do the work in Montana to get these facilities up and running. I think that’s a great thing for us,” Morigeau said.
Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, said the state sells roughly 60 million board feet of lumber a year, and the mill is located close to state trust land timber.
He said every mile needed to move a log to a sawmill makes the lumber worth less to the state. 
“This mill is located in a strategic location for the taxpayers of the state of Montana,” Curdy said.
But Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, said the $6 million shouldn’t be spent that way.
Regier said he supports the industry and remembers seeing homemade signs in the Flathead in the 1990s that said, “This Family Supported by the Timber Industry.”
At the time, however, he said that industry supported itself.
“We’re spending taxpayer dollars to do what loggers did in the ‘90s,” Regier said.
Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, said even as the Senate tried to help a sawmill, it was contemplating a bill that would hurt commercial businesses.
He pointed to HB 231, which aims to support residential property taxpayers, but passes on increases to other groups, including commercial property taxpayers, he said.
Usher said he was told many people were lined up to try to help revitalize the sawmill at Seeley Lake, and he had a question:

Bostar said he had 32 votes, but needed 33 votes to overcome the filibuster.","State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn, left, listens to State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s voters won’t decide on whether to legalize online sports gambling, at least not in 2026, after Lincoln Sen. Eliot Bostar decided Wednesday to end his campaign for Legislative Resolution 20CA this session.
The debate on the proposal was expected to go four hours because of an expected filibuster, but in an unusual move, Bostar pulled the proposal before lawmakers could vote on it.
Bostar told reporters he didn’t feel like waiting until the four-hour time limit to whip votes to support his proposal. Bostar said he had 32 votes, but needed 33 to overcome a filibuster. 
“I think it is responsible to move on with the agenda and move on to other things,” Bostar said. “The votes changed back and forth throughout this entire process. It’s a very dynamic and fluid situation.” 
 Societal harms cited 

His proposal will be left on “select file” for the next legislative session, allowing lawmakers to resume second-round debate on the measure next year. Despite having 32 votes, by Bostar’s count, his proposal barely survived the first round. 
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who chairs the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, led the successful filibuster. He emphasized that his opposition is not a “moral position against gambling as a whole,” but he feels it should be done in moderation. 
“I can attest that many men in their 20s do not have the wisdom to abstain from things that are harmful to themselves,” von Gillern said.  
Throughout the debate, lawmakers against the ballot initiative spoke to the potential social harms of gambling, including depression, anxiety and bankruptcy, particularly for young men. Supporters saw it as new revenue for the state and a way for the Legislature to be in the “driver’s seat” of what the regulation looks like. 
  State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Lawmakers used similar arguments that were made during the first round of debate. Bostar has estimated that the change would generate at least $32 million each year. Opponents questioned that reality and whether revenue was worth the negative effects of gambling. 
Earlier last month, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, State Auditor Mike Foley, and other past state and federal lawmakers urged state senators in a letter to reject Bostar’s measure. Other groups, such as Stop Predatory Gambling and the Nebraska Family Alliance, have called Bostar’s ballot initiative a “direct threat” to families in the state. 
State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering echoed those concerns. 
“We cannot build a stronger Nebraska by promoting habits that can hurt families and feed addiction,” Hardin said. 
Gov. Jim Pillen is out of step with his predecessors in voicing support for legalizing online sports betting. 
 One of 18 states 

Currently, 32 states allow online sports betting since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting. Nebraska allows casino-style gambling at the state’s six existing horse racetracks — so-called “racinos.” Nebraskans approved the change in 2020. 
Several gambling lobbyists spoke in support of the amendment during a recent public hearing, pointing to public polling that showed support for online sports gambling. 
After failing to overcome a filibuster, the Cornhusker State remains one of the 18 states that haven’t legalized sports betting, dealing a loss to the gambling industry that has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in other states to convince lawmakers to legalize mobile sports betting. DraftKings and FanDuel have mobilized an army of former regulators and politicians to press for sports betting in state capitals.
State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney said he supported the proposal because it will let the state decide the terms instead of trying to change things after the fact, alluding to the state legislative attempts to change recently passed ballot initiatives on minimum wage and medical cannabis.
“If we don’t take care of it,” Clouse said, “Somebody else will.”

But amid federal funding cuts and student visa revocations, they're taking a broader lens.","Around this time last spring, students on college campuses across Connecticut were taking up residence in pro-Palestinian encampments to demonstrate their opposition to the war in Gaza and the role they saw their universities playing in the strife overseas.
This spring, campus demonstrations have returned. But they’re taking place under decidedly different circumstances.
Tuesday evening, Yale University students set up a handful of tents on Beinecke Plaza — the same location where hundreds of community members, almost exactly one year ago, gathered to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. 
What spurred the action this time around was a visit to the U.S. by Israeli National Security Minister Ben Gvir. As students were protesting, Gvir posted on social media platform X from a dinner in his honor at Mar-a-Lago.
Twelve hours later, Wednesday morning at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, students filed into the monthly Board of Trustees meeting carrying banners and signs that called on school leaders to protect international students amid a Trump administration crackdown on student visa holders. The federal government has revoked more than 50 student visas in Connecticut.
Undergraduate Student Government President Andy Zhang laid out the students’ demands to the board. He asked that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be banned from private spaces on campus; that UConn establish a fund to provide legal and financial support to individuals impacted by federal enforcement or funding cuts; and that administrators stand up for academic freedom. 
“I think it’s really important that the university publicly confirms that they will protect students,” Zhang said.

Fears of student arrests have heightened after plainclothes ICE agents arrested Columbia University student activist Mahmoud Khalil in his apartment building on March 8. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has since detained several international students who protested or voiced opinions in favor of Palestine or against the war in Gaza last year.
Those protests became a flashpoint during President Donald J. Trump’s campaign for a second term, and almost immediately upon taking office in January, he signed an executive order to “combat antisemitism.” In a statement detailing those efforts, the administration said it would “quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”
In recent days, leaders at hundreds of higher education institutions — many of whom were clearing out pro-Palestinian encampments last year — have galvanized in opposition to the Trump administration’s actions.
The presidents of Yale University, Wesleyan University, Connecticut College, Trinity College and Connecticut State Community College signed on to a public statement this week in response to the federal government’s actions, calling them, “unprecedented government overreach and political interference [that are] now endangering American higher education.”
“Our colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation,” the statement reads.
Rallies and demonstrations on campuses are also now taking a broader lens. 
Last week, local chapters of the American Association of University Professors organized a “day of action” across the country, including on several campuses in Connecticut. Protesters voiced their opposition to everything from federal funding cuts to student visa cancellations and the Trump administration’s demands of Columbia University and Harvard University — which rallygoers said they saw as threats to academic freedom.
Speaking to the Board of Trustees Wednesday, Zhang, the student government president, was direct. “There are students at UConn, your students, who are afraid to leave their dorms, afraid to go to class or afraid to speak up,” he said. “Collective action, not isolation, is what will keep us safe.” 
Reflecting outside after speaking to the board, Zhang said, “Students want to see admin take a stance, they want to see them fight back and be able to defend the students if the time comes.” Then he corrected himself: “I don’t think it’s a matter of if ICE will come on campus, but I think it’s a matter of when.” 
In a statement posted on UConn’s website and emailed to the student body Tuesday, UConn President Radenka Maric described the situation as “devastating” for international students. 
“We are a Connecticut institution and also a global university with a deep sense of care and compassion for members of our community,” the statement reads. “This is a very difficult and stressful time for our international students, faculty, and staff.” 
At Yale, pro-Palestinian protestors don’t appear deterred. Late Tuesday, students linked arms and formed a human chain around their temporary encampment — an effort to prevent it from being broken up.
But around 10 p.m., people who appeared to be employees of the university began handing out a printed card warning protestors of “disciplinary action and/or arrest.” The encampment disbanded shortly thereafter.
On social media, the organizers released a statement. “We know that the struggle for Palestinian liberation is not about one encampment,” it reads. “It is about the continuous struggle for freedom of all people in all places, from New Haven to Palestine.”
Protests were planned in New Haven again Wednesday night, when Gvir was expected to speak to a group off campus.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker watched the protest for about 20 minutes. When asked what he would tell Gvir if they could speak, he said: “Don’t come to our city. It’s unproductive. I don’t know what you say to someone like that. He is someone that clearly thrives on creating controversy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1834-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 21:00:24.518420

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered the United States government to pay North Dakota nearly $28 million dollars, finding that the executive branch “abandoned the rule of law” in its response to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests of 2016 and 2017.
In the lawsuit, filed in 2019, North Dakota requested $38 million in damages from the United States government — the total sum it claims it paid for policing and cleaning up the demonstrations.
In a long-awaited decision filed Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor sided with the state, finding the Corps at fault for negligence, public nuisance and civil trespass claims.
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


“While North Dakota was drowning in the chaos of the protests, the United States dropped an anvil into the pool and turned up the turmoil,” he wrote in a nearly 120-page order.
Thousands came to south-central North Dakota to protest the construction of the crude oil pipeline in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which views the project as a looming environmental hazard and an encroachment upon Native territory. It has also accused the pipeline of disrupting sacred cultural sites.
Demonstrators set up camp near where the pipeline crosses beneath Lake Oahe — a reservoir on the Missouri River managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers less than a half-mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Opponents urged the Army Corps of Engineers — and later, the federal courts — to deny the pipeline’s developer, Energy Transfer, the land easement necessary to cross Lake Oahe. 
The largest demonstration camp was located on land managed by the Corps.
The protests lasted from spring of 2016 to February of 2017, when former Gov. Doug Burgum ordered protesters to evacuate the land.
4 highlights from the 4-week DAPL protest trial

Traynor wrote the Army Corps was legally required to enforce its property rights as soon as it became aware of the protests — either by requiring the demonstrators to obtain a permit to use its land or forcing the protesters to leave. 
Early on in the demonstrations, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was in talks with the Army Corps about obtaining a special use permit, but those negotiations fell through, witnesses testified during the trial last year.
In September 2016, the Corps published a press release stating the permit had been granted, despite that the tribe never completed the application process. 
Had the Corps followed through with the permit, the agency could have prevented millions in damages to the state, Traynor continued. Such a permit could have required demonstrators to handle cleanup, incentivized protest leaders to prevent damage to the land and prohibited protesters from establishing permanent structures at the campsites, he reasoned. He said the agency could have closed its land if protesters refused to comply with these requirements.
The Wednesday ruling expands on a prior order published in December 2023, in which Traynor held that the Army Corps had violated its own permitting procedures by not requiring protesters to obtain the permit.
Traynor found that the Corps’ decision to allow protesters to use its land — coupled with the press release, which he characterized as an endorsement of the demonstrations — prolonged and intensified the movement.
The United States argued other factors were responsible for the protest’s rise in popularity, like the Corps’ pending decision on the pipeline easement, the tribe’s historic claims to the land and national media attention. Winona LaDuke, an Indigenous environmental activist, testified during the trial that the Corps’ actions surrounding the permit and press release did not affect her decision to be at the camp, for example.
Traynor in his Wednesday order called these elements “red herrings” and “immaterial” to the Corps’ fault in the protests.
“Certainly, protesters had their own independent incentives for why they protested,” Traynor wrote, “but as discussed above, the facts as adduced at trial show protesters were supported, enabled, and encouraged by the Corps’ granting of the de facto special use permit that gave protesters a refuge from which they could conduct repeated illegal and illicit activities.”
Lack of federal support overwhelmed law enforcement during DAPL, officials testify

The United States has argued that the Corps responded the best it could in an extraordinary situation, and that it did not know the protests would unfold the way they did. 
Traynor in his decision rejected this claim, finding that evidence presented at trial showed that the U.S. government knew early on that the demonstrations could balloon in size and become unruly.
North Dakota on multiple occasions asked for federal law enforcement to assist with managing the demonstrations, which Traynor said indicates the United States was aware that the protests posed a safety threat. 
The United States also said that it cannot be held liable for the damages because the protests were protected speech. 
Traynor said that while some protesters engaged in protected speech, the damages at issue in the lawsuit are not covered by the First Amendment since they resulted from violent behavior. He also noted the United States cannot use the First Amendment protections as a defense when no protesters are party to the case.
“The damages here were caused by tumultuous, unsanitary, and otherwise horrific conditions that caused significant violence to the land and responding law enforcement officers,” he wrote.
Participants in the protest, including those who testified during the trial, emphasized that not all were violent. Demonstrators also objected to the response of law enforcement in riot gear and tactics of private security personnel.
Traynor reduced the award to North Dakota by $10 million, since the U.S. government had already awarded the state a grant of that size to offset the cost of its emergency response to the protests.
The state also received a $15 million donation from pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners in connection to the protests.
Tribal activist faults North Dakota for high DAPL protest costs

Traynor’s decision comes more than a year after the case went to trial.
During the four-week trial, which kicked off in February 2024, the court heard from a wide-ranging cast of witnesses — including Burgum and former Gov. Jack Dalrymple, Native activists, federal officials and law enforcement.
It was not immediately clear whether the United States government would appeal Traynor’s decision. The Corps did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley called the decision “a major win for North Dakota taxpayers and the rule of law.”
“As outlined in trial testimony and Judge Traynor’s ruling, decisions made by the Obama administration emboldened protesters and ultimately caused millions of dollars in damage to North Dakota, while endangering the health and safety of North Dakota communities, families and law enforcement officers who responded to the protests,” Armstrong and Wrigley said in a joint statement.
Lake Oahe is the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s primary source of water. The pipeline’s path also includes unceded land recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation under an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been in operation since 2017. In a lawsuit brought against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by Standing Rock in 2016, a federal judge found that the Army Corps had violated the law by granting DAPL an easement without first conducting a full environmental review of the pipeline, which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
The judge vacated the easement and ordered the pipeline to be drained of oil until the Army Corps could complete an environmental impact study. A higher court in 2021 upheld the decision to pull the easement but ruled that DAPL could remain in operation, concluding that Standing Rock had not shown it is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the pipeline is not shuttered.
The environmental impact study is still in progress.
A separate legal challenge brought by Energy Transfer against environmental group Greenpeace related to the DAPL protests went to trial in February. A nine-person jury of Morton County residents found Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-24 00:16:20+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut to join multistate lawsuit against ‘unlawful’ tariffs,Lisa Hagen and Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/23/ct-tariff-lawsuit/,The lawsuit argues that President Trump does not have the authority to circumvent Congress and increase tariffs on most imports.,"Attorney General William Tong joined a multistate lawsuit Wednesday that is suing to block the Trump administration’s tariffs, which have rattled the markets and worried businesses and consumers about higher prices.
Connecticut is one of a dozen states challenging four of President Donald J. Trump’s executive orders, arguing that he does not have the authority to circumvent Congress and increase tariffs on most imports.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Tong called the tariffs “unlawful, unconstitutional and destructive.” He argued that under Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, only Congress is given the power to levy tariffs. 
The lawsuit also argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate international trade during a “national emergency,” and which President Trump has cited as allowing him to enact the tariffs, does not provide a legitimate legal backing for Trump’s actions. 
The executive orders include a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, a 145% tariff on China and a 10% tariff on countries worldwide. Trump has also promised reciprocal tariffs on a number of countries but paused most of them for 90 days.
The back-and-forth over the president’s tariff policy has left things in a state of flux, particularly amid a growing trade war with China. But Trump said Tuesday that a 145% rate on Chinese imports “will come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” Those comments, in part, led to a rise in global markets on Wednesday.
Trump said Wednesday afternoon from the Oval Office that he hasn’t brought down the high tariffs on China yet.
“I haven’t brought it down. I said it’s a high tariff, but I haven’t brought it down,” Trump said after signing executive orders on Wednesday. “It basically means China is not doing any business with us essentially because it’s a very high number.”
But U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said during the Wednesday press conference that even with the pauses on reciprocal tariffs, the new levies would hurt consumers and businesses.
“Ten percent [tariffs] still across the board — on our allies. On countries that make things we could never make: Bananas. Coffee. We’re not growing them in the United States,” said Blumenthal.  
Blumenthal and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, who also joined Tong’s announcement on Wednesday, have been vocal opponents of the tariff policy and support bipartisan legislation that would allow Congress to regain authority on the issue. 
Blumenthal touted this legislation, noting that it is supported by seven Democrats and seven Republicans. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., has introduced similar legislation in the House. 
The lawsuit alleges that states are going to face “increased costs when purchasing necessary equipment and supplies essential to their economies” as a result of the tariffs, an assumption echoed at the Wednesday press conference. 
Tong and Blumenthal both cited research from the Yale Budget Lab estimating a loss of $4,900 per household as a result of the tariffs, with prices for clothing and shoes being particularly affected. 
Courtney, whose district includes the General Dynamics Electric Boat plant that produces submarines for the U.S. Navy, said he was particularly concerned about how the tariffs would affect agreements with other countries. 
He referenced Australia, which is part of a deal, along with the U.S. and the U.K., to build three Virginia class submarines. 
“Right now, those same questions that are being asked in Canada are being asked in Australia about whether or not the U.S. is really an ally that they can rely on,” said Courtney. 
Oregon’s attorney general filed the latest tariff lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade. So far, only attorneys general from Democratic-led states have joined. 
That same court rejected a temporary restraining order requested by a group of small businesses that argued they would be immediately harmed by the tariffs. The judges ruled the tariffs can be left in place while the lawsuit continues in court.
Since the start of Trump’s tenure, Tong has been a part of numerous lawsuits challenging various executive orders and policies from the president. The most recent sued the administration for seeking to gut a handful of federal agencies that mediate labor disputes, provide funding for public libraries, museums and minority-owned businesses.
Connecticut Republican Party Chair Ben Proto said that by instituting the tariffs, Trump was doing exactly what he’d told voters he would do. 
“ He said he was going to institute tariffs if he was elected, and he was pretty overwhelmingly elected. I know the Democrats don’t like to think he was overwhelmingly elected, but some 78 million people voted for him, knowing full well what he was going to do.” 
Proto also criticized Tong, calling the lawsuit a waste of taxpayer dollars. He also said neither Tong, Blumenthal nor Murphy knew what the fallout would be from the tariffs. 
“ I have no idea what the tariffs are going to do, and I think the issue is if you’re looking for an answer as to what they’re going to do in the next 10 minutes, I think that will be a very different answer than what they’re going to do in the next 10 months,” Proto said.
When asked specifically about what has been gained from the China tariffs, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the White House Wednesday that it is “ensuring the rest of the world knows that the United States of America is no longer going to be ripped off.” She said there are 18 proposals “on paper” from other countries to try and strike a trade deal.
Leavitt said to “have some patience and you will see” when pressed if the tariffs have worked.
Trump said Wednesday that tariff negotiations with multiple countries are “doing very well.” The president said his team is still working with other countries on potential deals. But if those don’t come to fruition, they will set new rates in the coming weeks.
“If we don’t have a deal with a company or a country, we’re going to set the tariff. That will happen over the next two or three weeks. We’ll be setting the number,” Trump said. “We’re dealing with a lot of countries right now.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8587-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 21:00:24.518420

CHICAGO — The jury considering state Sen. Emil Jones III’s federal corruption trial indicated late Wednesday that it may be deadlocked on two of the three counts Jones is charged with after 18 hours of deliberations.

The news came in a note to U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood, which she read to attorneys gathered in her courtroom around 5 p.m. Wednesday — the second full day of deliberations in Jones’ trial. While the jury sent a series of notes both logistical and substantive on Monday afternoon and Tuesday, there was silence from the jurors until the end of the day Wednesday.

“At this point, it doesn’t look like the jury can reach a unanimous agreement on counts 1 and 3,” the note read. “Is there any assistance that can be provided?”

Count 1 accuses Jones, D-Chicago, of having agreed to accept bribes from red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-FBI cooperator Omar Maani in the form of a $5,000 campaign contribution and a job for his former intern. The government alleges Jones agreed to the bribes in exchange for limiting legislation he’d proposed that would affect Maani’s industry. The feds argue it doesn’t matter that Maani never paid the $5,000 and Jones never amended his bill.

Count 3 alleges that Jones lied to the FBI about the purported bribes when agents showed up to his house on Sept. 24, 2019. During that interview, which was secretly recorded, the agents told Jones they were investigating his colleague, then-state Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago. Sandoval would later plead guilty to bribery and tax fraud charges related to Maani and the red-light camera industry but died in late 2020.

Wood told the attorneys she likely would give the jury what’s referred to as a “Silvern Instruction,” which is dictated by case law and encourages the jury to keep trying to reach unanimity. But that will wait until jurors return on Thursday morning.

The jury also asked whether they’d be able to take Friday off or leave early that day if deliberations were still ongoing by Thursday evening, intending to come back on Monday. The judge said she’d be amenable to the jury taking Friday off so long as progress was being made.

In a third note, jurors asked a substantive question about Count 1: Whether they needed to agree that both the $5,000 contribution and the job for Jones’ former intern were accepted to reach a verdict. Lawyers indicated loose agreement that the law states only one of the alleged bribes need be proven.

If the jury does deadlock, Jones’ would be the third high-profile federal corruption trial in seven months to end in a hung jury. In February, jurors deliberating former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan’s case deadlocked on six of the 23 counts while convicting him on 10 and acquitting on seven. And in September, a judge had to declare a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on all five counts alleging the former president of AT&T Illinois bribed Madigan in 2017.

Jones, whose father Emil Jones Jr. had a decadeslong career in the General Assembly capped by a six-year stint as president of the Illinois Senate, was charged in 2022 but declined to resign, despite pressure from Senate leadership and Gov. JB Pritzker. He won another four-year term to the Illinois Senate in November of that year, although the senator has remained barred from his previous leadership roles, including chairing a committee. In January, Jones surpassed 16 years as a lawmaker.

The senator last week made the risky decision to testify in his own defense, which opened him up to grueling cross-examination. In closing arguments Monday, prosecutors contrasted Jones’ statements on the witness stand with other testimony and what was heard on hours of secret recordings of dinners with Maani and the FBI interview.

,DC,2025-04-23 23:35:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump signs education orders, including overhaul of college accreditations",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-education-orders-including-overhaul-college-accreditations,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed a series of education-focused orders Wednesday related to accreditation in higher education, school discipline policies, historically Black colleges and universities, artificial intelligence in education and workforce development.The executive orders are the latest in a slew of efforts from Trump to dramatically reshape the federal role in education. Last month, Trump called on U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of her own agency.In one executive order, Trump aims to “overhaul” college accreditation, setting up more of a clash between his administration and higher education as they look to reform the system responsible for ensuring institutions meet quality standards.The order directs McMahon to hold accreditors accountable by “denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, for accreditors’ poor performance or violations of federal civil rights law,” according to a White House fact sheet.The order also directs McMahon and Attorney General Pam Bondi to “investigate and take action to terminate unlawful discrimination by American higher education institutions, including law schools and medical schools.”During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to fire “radical Left accreditors,” claiming they “have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.”AI in educationTrump also signed an executive order aimed at advancing artificial intelligence in education. The order calls for a White House task force on AI education that will help agencies implement a “Presidential AI Challenge” and establish public-private partnerships to provide resources for AI education in K-12 schools.The order also directs McMahon to “prioritize the use of AI in discretionary grant programs for teacher training and directs the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to prioritize research on the use of AI in education,” according to a White House fact sheet.The order also calls for Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, by collaborating with the director of the National Science Foundation, to “work with State and local workforce organizations and training providers to identify and promote high-quality AI skills education coursework and certifications across the country.”Job trainingAnother order directs McMahon, Chavez-DeRemer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to “modernize American workforce programs to prepare citizens for the high-paying skilled trade jobs of the future,” according to a White House fact sheet.The order asks the Cabinet members to review federal workforce programs and refocus programs to train workers in industrial manufacturing.Trump and Lutnick framed the order as part of the administration’s moves this month to place tariffs on every trading partner, with particularly high levies on goods from China.“All those factories that you’re bringing in because of your trade policy, we’re going to train people” to work in them, Lutnick said.Following the signings, Trump took several questions on his tariffs policy, acknowledging the rate on China was “high” but saying that was by design to hurt Chinese manufacturers.“It basically means China is not doing any business with us, essentially, because it’s a very high number,” he said. “So when you add that to the price of a product, you know, a lot of those products aren’t going to sell, but China is not doing any business.”Other ordersOther education-related executive orders signed Wednesday include: An order that makes school discipline policies centered on “objective behavior;”an order mandating “full and timely disclosure of foreign funding by higher education institutions;”an order establishing a White House initiative on historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, and a “President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs” within the Education Department.",,,,2025-04-23 20:07:18.421307

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Senate President Mattie Daughtry counts her work crafting and passing a paid family and medical leave program specifically for Maine among her proudest achievements. She even remembers falling asleep at the bar she owns as she checked the bill language over and over again.
The passage of that legislation in 2023 was the culmination of decades of work building a program that reflects Maine’s economy and responds to the needs of workers and employers, Daughtry (D-Cumberland) said during a press conference Wednesday afternoon organized to express opposition to a series of bills that would delay, weaken or dismantle the program that she said “was built with care.” 
During a public hearing later Wednesday before the Legislature’s Labor Committee, several other legislators questioned the sustainability of the program and argued it is another tax on workers who are already struggling to make ends meet. 
“Mainers want to work hard. They also want to be there for their family,” said House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), who joined Daughtry in defending the program. 
Fecteau spoke of his mother, who had to leave her job as a direct care worker to tend to her husband when he was diagnosed with a terminal illness. He said that decision left her in a financial hole that many others find themselves in trying to balance the “Maine values” of upholding a strong work ethic while taking care of one’s family.
Cassie Nedwell, a mother of three who lives in Cape Elizabeth, underscored the importance of paid leave by sharing the different experiences she had after giving birth to each of her children. Her employer at the time provided her eight weeks of leave after her first child was born, which she said were critical for bonding, breastfeeding and allowing her body to heal. However, she and her husband weren’t able to take extended leave after their second child was born and only her husband could secure 12 weeks of leave after the third child. 
The state’s paid family and medical leave program will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one or the birth of a new child. 
In addition to supporting workers, Fecteau said businesses need the program to help attract employees. 
However, the lawmakers who are proposing exemptions, modifications or efforts to repeal the benefit program argue they are looking to lessen the burden for employers and employees. For example, Sen. Russell Black (R-Franklin) would like to exempt agricultural workers because the seasonal nature of the work isn’t conducive to a laborer taking off weeks at a time, especially during planting or harvesting seasons. 
Rep. Nathan Carlow (R-Buxton) said his bill to exempt public school districts does not weaken the program, but addresses what he sees as an inequity. Carlow said many school districts already offer comparable leave programs so those employees shouldn’t pay for that benefit twice. 
However, the Maine Education Association said it was confused by that proposal because school districts more often have sick leave banks, which are not the same as paid family and medical leave. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce supported a handful of the bills, including one to delay when benefits can be accessed and those looking to better accommodate employers wishing to use a substitute private plan. However, it did not support any of the bills to repeal the program entirely. 
Daughtry introduced one bill on behalf of the Department of Labor, though said she is opposed to all of the other bills heard by the committee Wednesday. 
“We must give the program the time and space it needs to launch effectively,” she said, encouraging the committee to reject the other proposals.
She said the changes in her bill are coming from the people who have been working to implement this program and have identified specific targeted refinements to the policy. 
Daughtry did acknowledge to the committee that if she were to support another bill, it would be the proposed constitutional amendment from Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) to ensure that the program funds can’t be used for any purpose other than paying out the benefit to Maine workers. However, she isn’t supporting it because she sees it as duplicative of existing safeguards. 
Labor Commissioner Laura Fortman said the department opposes any changes that would repeal or delay implementation, create confusion, or negatively affect the solvency of the trust fund behind the program. Aside from the department’s bill, LD 894, all the other bills would fall into one of those categories, she said. 
However, the department is not taking a position on the proposed constitutional amendment.

Kelly Armstrong presents to lawmakers at the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2025. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday vetoed a bill to use public tax dollars for private school tuition but signaled support for a separate Education Savings Account bill still under consideration.
House Bill 1540 would have established Education Savings Accounts for private school students. Armstrong said in a statement that he supports school choice but said the bill “falls far short of truly expanding choice as it only impacts one sector of our student population.” 
The statement noted that of North Dakota’s 168 school districts, only 19 have private schools, with most in larger communities. 
“House Bill 1540 fails to deliver the school choice North Dakota needs, especially in rural areas where nonpublic school options are few and far between,” Armstrong said in the statement.
North Dakota lawmakers advance private school voucher bill

The bill passed the House 49-43 on Monday. It had previously passed the Senate 27-20. 
Lawmakers would need 63 votes in the House and 32 votes in the Senate to override the veto.
The cost to the state would have depended on how many families used the vouchers but was estimated at about $20 million in the first year.
A competing bill, Senate Bill 2400, would allow public dollars to be used for private school tuition, but also would establish Education Savings Accounts for public school and homeschooled students.
Armstrong in his veto message urged lawmakers to use Senate Bill 2400 to combine the best parts of both bills.
“Passing a voucher bill that caters to only a small segment of North Dakota’s student population all but guarantees a voter referendum and threatens to derail the prospect of good school choice policy for years to come,” he wrote.
Armstrong on Monday signed a bill that could lead to public charter schools in North Dakota.

Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, speaks in favor of Senate Bill 39, the payday loans bill, on Tuesday, April 15, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Senate passed legislation on Thursday that would significantly cap the interest rates and fees payday lenders can charge for loans of $25,000 or less. 
Senate Bill 39 would remove payday lenders from an exemption in the state’s lending laws, and require payday loan companies to cap interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate, or APR, of 36% for loans of $25,000 or less. 
An estimated 15,000 Alaskans take out a payday loan each year, according to research by the Alaska Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, and borrowers take out an average of $440. The interest rates ranged from 194% to 521% APR, which is the total of interest and fees. 
Researchers found borrowers take out an average of 5.4 loans, “often one to pay off the other,” said Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, who sponsored the legislation. “And it trapped people, particularly people who were desperate, in these cycles of debt.” 
Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans often for small amounts that are meant to be repaid on the borrower’s next payday. Typically there’s no credit check or verification of ability to repay the loan. The terms may vary, but lenders often are authorized to withdraw funds directly from the borrower’s bank account on payday. 
Similar legislation to cap interest rates for small loans was introduced in the Alaska House by then-Rep. Stanley Wright, R-Anchorage, in 2023, but it failed to advance in the Senate. 
In 2023, over 7,000 Alaskans received payday loans totaling over $17 million, according Dunbar, in a sponsor statement filed with the bill. 
“Studies showed that the people who end up taking out these loans end up worse off than they otherwise would be, and actually have an increased rate of bankruptcy,” Dunbar said. “And so we decided to take up the bill.”
Opposition has come from banking and “fintech” or financial technology groups that provide digital banking services, like mobile banking and online lending services. They argued the legislation and the APR cap would dissuade lenders and limit access to credit for borrowers, who are in need of payday loans. 
Dunbar said under the new legislation, lenders are still welcome to do business in the state, just with the limit on interest rates and fees. He also pointed to a 36% cap already in place for U.S. military personnel. 
“There’s already federal law that says this can’t be offered to service members,” he said. “If it’s good enough to protect our soldiers and airmen, then it’s probably good enough to protect all Alaskans.”
Alaska’s 13 payday loan companies pay the state a combined $39,000 per year in license fees, according to the Division of Banking and Securities. Reclassifying those companies would cost the state about $26,000 in lost revenue because they will be licensed under a different section of law with lower fees. The division expects to be able to absorb those costs and isn’t requesting additional funding from the Legislature.
The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 14 to 6, and now advances to the House Finance Committee. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, was the only minority-caucus member to vote for the bill, while Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, was the only majority member to vote against it.

The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program, further delaying an effort that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years.
States will have an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access to underserved areas across the country.
The extension comes as the Trump administration prepares to make changes to the BEAD program, according to a notice from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The department is currently reviewing the program “to remove unnecessary rules and mandates, to improve efficiency, take a more technology-neutral approach, cut unnecessary red tape, and streamline deployment,” the notice said.
The $42.45 billion program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, began falling behind schedule in part because of inadequate federal mapping of where broadband is most needed and a lengthy challenge process to the maps. As a result, the slow-moving program has some local officials and experts questioning its efficiency.

They anticipate that federal officials might change an affordability requirement, which mandates states include a low-cost service option for low-income households, or the type of technologies given preference under the program. That shift likely would be away from fiber-optic internet toward satellites or other technology.
Earlier this month, more than 100 state lawmakers from 28 states sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick requesting that any changes to the BEAD program be optional rather than mandatory. They argued that mandatory changes could undo their BEAD plans and delay broadband deployment by a year or more.
The BEAD program originally had required states to submit their final proposals to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within a year of their initial plan’s approval. Citing “extraordinary circumstances,” however — the new federal review — deadlines for states’ final proposals will be moved, according to the notice.
NTIA declined to comment for this story.
All 50 states have had their initial BEAD proposals approved, unlocking a portion — often 20% — of the money the feds will provide. As of April 14, Delaware, Louisiana and Nevada are the only states to have submitted their final proposals for public comment, according to the NTIA’s BEAD Progress Dashboard.
Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas are the only states that have not made any progress beyond having their initial proposal approved, according to the tracker.

The committee met to discuss a complaint made by Fett against the liberal group for alleging she was a former stripper. On a section of the organization’s website titled “the Burn Book” providing information about Republican lawmakers, Fett’s occupation is listed as “Former Stripper, Moms for Liberty Fanatic, Devil in Disguise.” Fett, who works as a marketing communications director, said the claim was false and the online post could impact her work in the future.
The complaint was received March 24, and Rep. Bill Gustoff, R-Des Moines, said the group was given a 10-day period, expiring April 10, to respond. When no response was received, he said, the committee later proceeded to schedule the meeting and gave members of the organization time to respond.

Heather Ryan, one of the leaders of the group, said she “got a tip from a constituent that said that that was her former profession.” Ryan said she could not prove that Fett formerly worked as an adult dancer.
“There was no reason for me to not believe it,” Ryan said. “I don’t think it’s bad work. Sex work is work. So, you know, I don’t care about that. I thought she’d be more upset that we called her a ‘devil in disguise,’ but who am I to judge? So had she contacted me, had she reached out in any fashion and said anything about it, I would have taken it down. But she didn’t.”
Heaven Chamberlain, another organizer with the group, said she made the graphic with information from a “reputable source,” but said she would not name who she received the information from. She also said that listing Fett’s profession as a “former stripper” was not inherently negative.
“I’m just gonna say, I worked as an OnlyFans model, there’s nothing wrong with that, just like there’s nothing wrong with being a stripper,” Chamberlain said.
Fett told the committee she filed the complaint because the group was registered to lobby lawmakers.

“When you do register as a lobbyist, you agree to operate at a higher level of professionalism, under rules,” Fett said. “And as you heard two individuals say, this was a rumor on an occupation that clearly isn’t true, that was published and promoted as a way to harm.”
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, questioned the “economic damage” caused by the posting, but said she  understood that it is “very frustrating to be an attacked on social media.” Gustoff said the rules allow the ethics committee to take action on subjects that have the intention of harm, and do not necessarily require proof of harm.
The committee unanimously approved issuing a public reprimand against the organization — a way of expressing disapproval of the group’s actions, but that does not put other sanctions on the organization.
Fett said her complaint was filed to ensure that professionalism is upheld at the Legislature.
“The end result is not the reason it’s the right thing to do,” Fett said. “Like I said, we’re taking a stance (against people who) make a statement with the intention of harming someone else, especially someone who’s representing constituents.”

Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, details the final budget compromise while Gov. Mike Braun listens on April 23, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican lawmakers in the Senate and the House appear to have reached a final budget compromise, as detailed in a late Wednesday afternoon press conference with Gov. Mike Braun. 
A dismal forecast last week projecting a $2 billion shortfall — with an additional $400 million less available in the current budget cycle — hampered Republican spending plans. Under the updated proposal, public health programs, economic development and higher education got bigger cuts and total reserves dropped about three percentage points from the Senate budget to just above 10%. 
Legislators also increased taxes on multiple forms of tobacco — not just cigarettes — in the final budget compromise.

“We’re reducing government spending while funding our most critical priorities and providing tax relief for Hoosiers,” said House Speaker Todd Huston, pointing to continuing income tax cuts. “We’re in a good position to weather some potentially lean times because of our commitment to financial responsibility.” 
Senate Pro Tem Rodric Bray said that, similar to projected local government budget decreases under a property tax measure already signed into law, state government will also operate under a slim budget.
“We have asked local governments … to spend within their means and tighten their belts,” said the Martinsville Republican. “We’re doing exactly the same thing here.”
Long-sought universal school choice vouchers will become reality in the second budget year at a cost of roughly $93 million. 
Currently, Indiana’s vouchers are available to Hoosier earning 400% of the amount required for a student to qualify for the free or reduced-price lunch program, or roughly $220,000. An estimated 3.5% of families don’t qualify under the current eligibility guidelines.
Without the voucher expansion, K-12 will get $861 million dollars over the next two years, or a 2% increase annually when excluding curricular materials. 
Braun tied projected final woes to national economic uncertainty of the previous four years, though much of the market volatility has occurred since President Donald Trump took office in January.
“Sooner or later, those chickens come home to roost,” he said. 
Braun said he was “the loudest voice” on the federal deficit during his term in Congress, which overlapped with Trump’s first term and President Joe Biden.
 Budget details

Cigarette taxes will increase by $2 to just under $3 a carton, with proportional increases for other forms of tobacco. Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, said those funds will offset increases to Medicaid. 
Such growth will bring in nearly $800 million in cigarette taxes alone with another $50 million for other forms of tobacco. 
Tax increases are one of the most effective ways to curb cigarette use, which does contribute to the state’s overall poor health metrics and Medicaid expenses. 




Extra budget provisions:

A caseload study for the Indiana Department of Child Services rather than a repeal of caps
Creates a delinquent tax amnesty program for Hoosiers who have an unpaid tax liability that was due before January 1, 2023
Granting the Indiana Department of Administration “sole” policy control over the Statehouse’s meditation room
Resolving conflicting language over the Indiana Historical Society’s state lease
No salary increases for General Assembly members for the two-year budget cycle
Penalizes certain delayed payments from Managed Care Organizations
Reduced “Freedom and Opportunity” education line item that can be used to fund dropout prevention and other K12 programming
Reduces eligibility for On My Way Pre-K and subsidized child care
Requires higher education institutions to review department promotions and tenure policies relating to productivity





Bray called it “a really good policy” to discourage smoking, even if the expected tax revenue decreases over time. 
“That’s a good thing, because we think it means we have fewer smokers,” Bray said. 
Additionally, three agencies — the Department of Correction, the Department of Child Services and the Family and Social Services Administration — will have a combined augmentation fund pool of $300 million to cover unexpected expenses. Outside of K-12 funding, which makes up 47% of the budget, those three agencies get the largest amount of state dollars. 
“It just gives flexibility during challenging times,” said Mishler, noting that the fund will be distributed at the governor’s discretion.
The Indiana Economic Development Corp. had its budget reduced between 25-30%, coming on the heels of news from Indiana Legislative Insight that the governor’s office was considering a major audit of the quasi-public agency. 
Most agencies and departments — including the offices of statewide elected officials and the Commission for Higher Education — also saw a 5% reduction in their appropriation. 
But a two-year-old program to supplement local public health departments took a 60% cut, with funding falling from $100 million each year to $40 million.
Bray noted that much of those funds distributed to counties and some municipalities hadn’t been spent, or roughly 45% of the dollars sent out last year. 
“I think they’re still trying to build up and roll out their programs,” said Bray, emphasizing a desire to continue funding the program into the future. 
 Democratic pushback

Details of the final budget compromise were revealed to Democrats at the same press conference and leaders of the respective caucuses said more time would be needed to analyze the full document. 
“As this budget is digested over the next 24 hours, we’re going to have much more to consider. We’ve got to weigh just how public education and the needs of our children are being met. We have to weigh if Medicaid needs … and the elderly, the working Hoosiers, (and) everyday people, if those are being met,” said Sen. David Niezgodski, of South Bend.

Sen. Andrea Hunley, a former principal, criticized the voucher expansion for benefitting the “wealthiest families in the state,” noting that impoverished families wouldn’t see as much promised relief under the earlier property tax plan. 
“Families with home values that are assessed at under $150,000 actually are going to see an increase in their property tax bills,” the Indianapolis Democrat said. “Then at the same time, we’re going to be giving greater breaks to our wealthiest families … it’s just not a prudent time to look at voucher expansion.”
Hunley also questioned the commitment to reducing Medicaid expenses when Republicans cut public health funding. 
“We know that everyone’s got to make sacrifices this session but, again, it’s going to be on the back of the Hoosiers that need the support the most,” Hunley said.
Rep. Greg Porter pointed to an event last week with Trump cabinet official Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Both appeared alongside Braun to announce a flurry of health-related executive orders.  
“… now we’re down to $40 million (annually). Is that making Indiana healthy again?” Porter asked, borrowing a phrase coined by the trio. “I think it’s making us extremely vulnerable when it comes to health care.”
Though Porter praised the inclusion of the cigarette tax increase and the IEDC scrutiny, the Indianapolis Democrat said he didn’t support the spending plan until he learned more about K-12 funding and other provisions. 
“I don’t think it’s a budget, at this point, that we can completely embrace.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle | Getty Images)The Montana Farmers Union on Monday filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit brought by four Blackfeet Nation tribal members seeking an injunction against the Trump administration’s tariffs on Canada.
The organization, which has been around since 1912, said that joining the case was a way to continue fighting “on behalf of family farmers and ranchers.” 
“The executive branch has overstepped its constitutional and statutory authority on these tariffs. Montana farmers and ranchers can’t afford any more uncertainty or any more financial stressors – especially not random tariffs,” MFU President Walter Schweitzer said in a press release. 
Plaintiffs State Sen. Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard, both enrolled members of the Blackfeet Nation, originally filed the lawsuit in federal court earlier this month against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the United States of America, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, arguing that the tariffs levied by the administration against Canada violates Indigenous treaty rights and exceeds presidential authority. 
The suit claims the tariffs violate a 1794 treaty exempting tribes along the United States-Canadian border from being taxed or levied on goods between the nation. It also challenges the Trump administration’s ability to use emergency powers to bypass Congress to impose tariffs. Trump has declared that the fentanyl drug crisis at America’s borders constitute a national emergency, though Customs and Border Patrol have only seized 19 kilograms of fentanyl coming from Canada compared to 9,600 kilograms coming from Mexico.
Monday’s step to intervene was taking action for Montana family farmers and ranchers who “are facing dire financial and mental impacts if the tariffs remain in effect,” according to the release. 
“MFU’s members rely on a predictable and stable trade market and the tariffs imposed by the President not only exceed the President’s constitutional and statutory authority, they’ve ‘wallop[ed]’ the agricultural community in Montana, as no one can ‘plan or prepare,’” the proposed complaint states. 
“Because of the President’s tariffs, their goods will be more expensive to export, which will result in reduced profits and lost customers. Even worse, farms and ranches that have been in families for generations must be sold simply because the President’s isolationist and unlawful approach is incongruous with the international market with which these farmers and ranchers have been dealing and relying upon for decades. MFU’s members do not have robust markets in the United States for the crops they grow and those markets cannot be developed overnight,” according to court filings. 
According to the Office of United States Trade Representative, Montana’s largest market is Canada, with $869 million in goods exported to the state’s northern neighbor in 2024 — 37% of total exports. 
The top agricultural exports to Canada in 2024 included $113 million in live cattle; $106 million in dried legumes, $25 million in brewing and distilling dregs, $10.2 million in barley, and $10.1 million in cigarettes, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
The complaint from MFU mentions several members who have been impacted by the tariffs.
One member, John Wicks, a fourth generation farmer from Liberty County, said he was in contractual discussions with a cross-border trading partner for his organic lentils, but was told they could not enter into a contract due to the instability of the trade market before the tariffs were imposed. Specifically, “if American tariffs were going to be implemented, the partner would not take the crops,” harming Wicks financially, according to court filings 
“Our Canadian partners either won’t buy our crops or are offering significantly lower prices than our partners in the United States. Our partners in the United States know that our Canadian partners are doing this and are capitalizing on it by offering lower prices, so we’re getting squeezed,” Wicks wrote in a declaration of support for MFU’s filing. 
As of Wednesday afternoon, District Court Judge Dana Christensen had not issued a ruling on whether he would allow Montana Farmers Union to intervene. A hearing for the preliminary injunction will be held next Thursday at the Missouri River Federal Courthouse in Great Falls. Attorneys for the federal government have filed a motion to move the case to the Court of International Trade in New York, arguing the District Court doesn’t have jurisdiction over tariffs, but attorneys for the plaintiffs responded that case can be rightfully heard at the District Court as the lawsuit is over the constitutionality of executive orders.
“Farmers and ranchers have invested decades in developing reliable markets for our products,” Schweitzer said in the press release. “Overnight, these random tariffs have destroyed markets that will take decades to rebuild. This is why the authority to impose tariffs resides in Congress because it provides a forum for public debate and input and ensures the benefit outweighs the harm.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Iowa-cultivator-1181123755.jpg,,,2025-04-23 20:07:18.421307

(Karen E. Segrave/Arkansas Advocate) Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders vetoed two bills from the 2025 legislative session on Tuesday and returned them to their respective chambers.
Both bills had emergency clauses, meaning they would have gone into effect immediately upon Sanders’ signature.
House Bill 1961 would have created limited reasons for medical providers to “temporarily withhold a patient’s medical records from being released directly to the patient or any individual authorized by the patient” for up to 30 days.
Those reasons would have included the need to review a patient’s medical information or discuss it with the patient, or if the provider “reasonably believes that immediate disclosure of the medical records may lead to the patient’s misinterpreting the information in a manner that could adversely affect the patient’s health or safety.”
“Individuals have a right to access personal medical information, including medical imaging, test results, and other health records, in a timely fashion,” Sanders wrote in a letter explaining her decision not to sign HB 1961. “Because this bill may, in some cases, unduly delay the release of such information to patients who are entitled to it, I am vetoing this legislation.”
Senate Bill 451 would have required the state Education and Human Services departments to collaboratively establish “regional behavioral health programs” to help public and charter schools determine how best to help students who display behavior “substantially likely to cause injury to the student, other students, or staff.” It also would have required both state agencies to formulate behavioral health management plans for these students and help them transition back into school after the behavioral issue has been addressed.
Sanders wrote in her veto letter that she understands the need for “sufficient interventions” and has directed the Education and Human Services departments to “come up with a solution that is more tailored to the needs of our local public schools” than SB 451.

“School administrators, teachers, and principals are increasingly managing student behavioral issues, including aggression and violence,” Sanders wrote. “These issues cause disruptions in the academic environment, distracting from schools’ core function: a safe environment where all students can learn.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, was SB 451’s primary sponsor and said he appreciated Sanders’ “assurances that she understands the seriousness and the need for an immediate solution.”
“I’m less concerned with how it’s done, just that it is done,” Hester said.
SB 451 passed the Senate with a bipartisan majority of 30 votes, but it passed the House by the slimmest margin of 51 votes. Emergency clauses require two-thirds of lawmakers’ support to pass, and the House voted three times before SB 451’s emergency clause passed with 77 votes, 10 more than the minimum.
Similarly, HB 1961 passed the House with 75 votes but scraped the minimum of 18 votes in the Senate. The emergency clause subsequently passed with 26 votes when 24 were needed.
  Sen. Justin Boyd, R-Fort Smith (Courtesy/Arkansas Legislature)
HB 1961 was sponsored by two pharmacists: Rep. Brandon Achor, R-Maumelle, and Sen. Justin Boyd, R-Fort Smith.
The intent behind HB 1961 was to give medical professionals the opportunity to “sit down and have a real conversation” about a patient’s health needs, such as a cancer diagnosis, “before this scary news or potentially unclear news gets uploaded into an electronic chart of some sort and becomes immediately available without the appropriate context and compassion and the human side of the doctor-patient relationship,” Boyd said Wednesday.
He added that he might sponsor similar legislation in the future that addresses the governor’s “implementation concerns.”
Arkansas elected officials reflect on achievements as session comes to a close

Sanders issued two vetoes last week — one that vetoed a bill to legalize the delivery of medical marijuana or the purchase of it from a drive-thru, and a line-item veto eliminating the salary for the director of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s Institute on Race and Ethnicity. A UALR spokesperson said the position was vacant and the university had not planned to fill it.
Lawmakers can vote to override the governor’s vetoes with a simple majority in both chambers before the sine die adjournment of a legislative session. Hester and Boyd said they do not expect to ask their colleagues to override the vetoes of their respective bills.
The Legislature concluded its session and recessed April 16, and it will reconvene May 5 to handle any unfinished business before adjourning sine die.

SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, would remove the board’s appointing authority and increase its membership from 16 to 17 members, by making Gov. Kay Ivey the 17th voting member. 
“Previously she was not a voting member, and now she’ll be a voting member,” Elliot said.

The governor would be the appointing authority for most seats, including members from each congressional district, with eight at-large appointments coming from the speaker, president pro tempore, and the minority leaders of the House and Senate.
“Basically, it takes the board from being a self-appointing board to being one that has appointing authorities,” Elliot said.
The House State Government committee approved the legislation with some audible no’s from Democrats. The Senate passed the bill last week 26-5. The new structure will take effect as current board members’ terms expire. 
Rep. Prince Chestnut, D-Selma, opposed the legislation because he did not like part of the bill that says each board member will “serve at the pleasure of his or her appointing authority.”
“This makes it an extremely hyper-political board,” Chestnut said.
Currently, the Alabama Department of Archives and History has two trustees from each congressional district and two additional at-large members, plus the governor or their designees.
Elliot was one of several Republicans who attacked the Archives Department for hosting a presentation on LGBTQ+ history in Alabama in June 2023, claiming the board is not accountable to elected officials, calling it a “unicorn.”
Elliott then introduced a bill in the redistricting special session in mid-2023 to strip Archives of $5 million, which did not pass.
He also introduced a similar bill for the 2024 legislative session that would have given state officials and legislative leaders the power to appoint board members, while keeping the board size the same. The bill passed the Senate and a House committee but did not reach the House floor.
The bill will move to the full House.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)For 60 years, Head Start, a program designed to support the nation’s youngest and most economically challenged children, “has given children and parents a real opportunity,” U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said outside the Cranston Child Development Center Wednesday. 
But now a recently leaked document from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suggests Head Start, which falls under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), could see its funding cut entirely as part of an agency reorganization.  
The prospect of eliminating Head Start funding surfaced in a leaked, 64-page budget document first shared by Inside Medicine, a Substack-hosted publication, and later verified by the Washington Post and other major news outlets. The document comprises President Donald Trump’s suggestions for the HHS budget in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
“Our job in government is to create opportunities, not to deny it,” Reed told the crowd gathered. “We know that investing in early education for children, especially comprehensive, high quality Head Start, pays for itself many times.”
Since its inception, the program started under President Lyndon B. Johnson as part of larger anti-poverty initiatives has served newborns through 5-year-olds, subsidizing child care, preschool and other early learning supports for families with incomes up to the poverty line. The Early Head Start program also offers services to pregnant women. Enrollment data from 2023 showed 1,610 Rhode Island kids in Head Start, and 675 kids in Early Head Start.
“The whole premise of Head Start is to have children going into kindergarten equally with children that have parents who can afford to pay for child care or send them to private schools,” said Stacy Del Vicario, vice president of child development at the Comprehensive Community Action Program (CCAP), the parent organization of the Cranston center, in an interview after the press event. 
HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
According to the leaked document, Trump’s proposed HHS budget “does not fund Head Start. This elimination is consistent with the Administration’s goal of returning education to the States and increasing parental choice. The Federal government should not be in the business of mandating curriculum, locations, and performance standards for any form of education.”
“Losing this program would make it so that we’d have hundreds of thousands of children that will not have access to early child care, which means that then you have parents that aren’t able to work,” Del Vicario said. “Because how are you affording child care?”
It’s possible that Trump’s budget proposal might not inform the congressional budget at all — it serves more as an executive branch wishlist, rather than a concrete spending plan. But since Trump took office, Rhode Island’s congressional delegates have hosted a flurry of press conferences designed to preempt and publicize the potential and ongoing threats to certain spending programs. 
On Wednesday, it was Reed alone who came to Cranston to speak in defense of the program which received around $12 billion in fiscal year 2024. Surrounded by Head Start providers and a few parents, Reed emphasized the program as a means of preparing kids for kindergarten and elementary school regardless of their background. The program, the senator said, makes “school readiness…a family affair.”










Losing this program would make it so that we’d have hundreds of thousands of children that will not have access to early child care, which means that then you have parents that aren’t able to work. Because how are you affording child care?


– Stacy Del Vicario, vice president of child development at the Comprehensive Community Action Program


“Now is the time to raise our voices and push back against these proposals that will undermine one of the most effective programs we have for children,” Reed said. “The Trump administration says they want to empower parents and send education to local communities. But Head Start is already a local program.”
Storm Brooks is a mother of two boys who attended Head Start and Early Head Start at the Cranston center.
“I wanted to start off the speech by mentioning how unexpected life is,” Brooks told the crowd, then recounted how her finances turned upside down when the pandemic hit in 2020.
Head Start allowed her young boys in “a trusted facility that not only meets my financial needs, but also gives me the surety that my children are safe, protected and cared for by trained professionals,” Brooks said. She added her kids have shown improvements in cognition, school and sociability since they entered the program.
Reed zoomed out a bit further to consider Head Start as a way to build up young minds for future accomplishments. “If you don’t have that stimulation as a child, you won’t develop your full potential, and you won’t be able to give as much as you could to this country,” he said.
Brooks offered a more specific example: a mother of two girls she often sees bringing her kids to the Cranston center. 
 “I see her Uber and Lyft her way here every morning and every afternoon, transferring her car seats to and fro from the building, making sure that her children get here safely,” Brooks said, adding that she wonders what this mother would do without Head Start.
“How much more difficult would it be for her to save up to have that vehicle for her children?” Brooks said. “Because of Head Start, that mother is out working today to be able to do just that.”
While the Head Start funding cuts may be hypothetical at the moment, the closure of regional Head Start offices is not. On April 3, Head Start providers nationwide received an email from the HHS’ Administration for Children and Families that five regional offices — Boston, New York, Chicago, Seattle and San Francisco — would be closed and consolidated starting on April 1.
“We were very caught off guard. Probably not as much as they were, because they literally walked to work and then it wasn’t available,” Del Vicario said of the people working in the shuttered Head Start offices.

‘Not just babysitting’
Proponents of Head Start say the program has long been underfunded at both the state and federal level, leaving a limited number of eligibility slots for families.  
Del Vicario has worked in Rhode Island Head Start for 16 years, but said she has never seen cuts of the same magnitude as the ones in the OMB proposal. Rhode Island’s delegation has “always been so forward thinking with early childhood,” she said, but added that many states are not so lucky. 
“There are a lot of states and people out there, unfortunately, that don’t realize that early childhood is not just babysitting or not just putting a kid in a rocking chair,” Del Vicario said. 
But she also acknowledged that people who aren’t raising young children might be unaware of the inner workings of the program, which she described as being tailored to “community needs,” offering a comprehensive spectrum of child care from between four and six hours of classroom time plus access to social workers, mental health supports, nutritionists, nurses and more. 
CCAP’s Head Start grants run on a five-year cycle, Del Vicario said, with the most recent starting in November 2024. So far the organization’s funding has not been imperiled. But the closure of the regional office is troubling, she said, because it’s become harder to access information. Federal contacts for technical assistance and training have remained intact, Del Vicario said, and they’ve been helpful in communicating what they know about the program’s status. 
Other questions remain unanswered.
“Who do we report into? Who do we turn our grants into? Who do we ask questions?” Del Vicario wondered. “Because we really haven’t been given any names yet. They’ve given us this generic email kind of thing.”
The lack of higher-up oversight has introduced concerns about grant compliance, Del Vicario said, as providers are still being monitored.

Here’s where that leaves Vermont.  .","Workers remove a toilet from a flood-damaged home on Third Street in Barre on July 12, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerIn 2023 and 2024, Linda Martin, chair of the Wolcott Selectboard, saw what happens when Flat Iron Road fills with water.Where Route 15 crosses the Lamoille River, a bridge forces the wide flow of the river to narrow, bending its path around big abutments in the water. When the river surges from heavy rains, water spills over its banks, washing across the surrounding land and flooding the nearby Flat Iron Road.Martin knows that the bridge abutments are the reason the road floods. The town hired engineers, who confirmed the problem and began designing alternatives to the bridge and its abutments that would help the water flow more easily.To continue that work of designing an alternative bridge, Wolcott’s selectboard had applied for a $71,250 grant from a relatively new program, allocated through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, meant to help communities prepare for disasters before they strike.Instead, on April 4, she — along with other municipal leaders and emergency managers around the country — learned that the Department of Homeland Security, under President Donald Trump, had ended the grant program altogether. The announcement put Wolcott’s project on hold and cut off $750 million for other projects nationwide, including $2 million in Vermont.This funding stream, called the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, was an annual funding opportunity for communities recently hit by disasters. It aimed to shift the federal response from reactive cleanup “toward research-supported, proactive investment in community resilience,” as FEMA’s website describes it. The program was guided by a philosophy captured in the oft-cited statistic that, on average, every dollar invested in preventing disasters can save $6 in disaster cleanup costs.FEMA has a wide umbrella of hazard mitigation funds, which BRIC once fell under. The BRIC program was separate from individual and municipal post-disaster recovery assistance, and those payouts are ongoing. When the program was canceled, the state, and the communities it works with, had been in the final stages of completing applications for the 2024 round of funding, which would have been due on April 18. That process ground to a halt.Most of the grants that communities had applied to last year, as part of the 2023 funding round, had been outlined and organized but had yet to be awarded — this is where Wolcott’s bridge project falls. “Those are gone. If it’s not awarded yet, it’s gone,” Stephanie Smith, Vermont Emergency Management’s head of hazard mitigation, said. It leaves $2 million in planned, proposed projects across the state suspended. The remaining three years of projects — applications submitted during the 2022, 2021 and 2020 rounds of funding — are what’s left. Since BRIC works by reimbursement, communities are now racing to complete projects already awarded and underway.About a week after the announcement of cancellation, the FEMA regional office advised Smith that communities could continue work on the ongoing projects, though they must complete them by their deadline — FEMA does not plan to offer extensions.FEMA disaster survivor assistance team specialists approach a home while doing outreach in Peacham on Sept. 3, 2024.  File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger‘We all collectively lose’The city of Barre is among the many Vermont cities and towns left in the lurch of BRIC cancellations, as it tries to address key infrastructure pain points that made the extreme floods of 2023 and 2024 as damaging as they were. As part of a broad hazard mitigation plan, the city had plans to redesign and replace a protective grate — called a debris rack — on Gunner’s Brook near Harrington Avenue. That rack worked almost “too well” at keeping floating debris like tree branches, leaves, and trash from clogging a narrow bend in the brook, as City Manager Nicolas Storellicastro described it. It creates a kind of inadvertent dam, raising water levels in this part of the river. When heavy rains come — as was the case in the July 2023 and 2024 floods — water rushes into the neighborhood.“It works very well on a day-to-day basis,” Storellicastro said, “but it may not have been designed for an event of the magnitude that we got.”The BRIC funding would have helped the city complete much of the work necessary to design and build a better debris rack, and restore floodplain to help the surrounding neighborhood absorb water without damaging homes.The need for this kind of flood-resilient infrastructure is likely to become more and more prevalent in the state, as scientists predict climate change only makes Vermont more vulnerable to more extreme precipitation and flooding. “These floods, they’re stronger, they’re bigger, and we’re seeing that our infrastructure is just not up to the task,” Storellicastro said.Because of this, the city has not abandoned its plans to replace the debris rack that the BRIC grant could have covered. Instead, Barre is looking to a different hazard mitigation grant program under FEMA, which is funding a number of other flood-preparedness infrastructure work in the city, along with a $68 million federal long-term disaster recovery fund recently awarded to the state through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. For that, the competition for an award is expected to be much stiffer.“I’m not willing to concede yet that the funding will disappear completely for this project,”  Storellicastro said. “We’re going to pivot, but that means that somebody else’s project, including maybe one of ours, doesn’t get funded. We all collectively lose when that happens. It just basically leads to another roll of the dice when the next storm inevitably comes.”Filling a planning gap Part of why planners and municipal leaders found BRIC funding so valuable was because it helped fund scoping projects and pre-disaster planning work, which is essential to do before shovels hit the ground. Essentially, it’s funding to open up future funding, Smith said. “Most of them are projects to help communities identify future flood risk reduction projects,” she said. Take Wolcott for example: In order to stop the flooding of Flat Iron Road, the town first needs to know that the abutments under the bridge are causing it, find out what an alternative might look like and get a cost estimate before they can secure funding.“That scoping funding is hard to find often. In order to do a big project, you need to have that work done in order to apply for funding to do that infrastructure project. So this helps (towns) get there,” Smith said. “It helps you get to being able to access funding to do the work.”The other type of project the state funded through BRIC were updates to municipalities’ hazard mitigation plans. In order to get any funding through FEMA, each town or city in Vermont needs to have a local disaster prevention plan that the agency has approved. So, every year, Vermont Emergency Management has submitted a BRIC application on behalf of all the communities that don’t have plans that meet FEMA’s standards.Like the scoping projects, it’s essential funding to open up more opportunities for funding. These local mitigation plans are particularly helpful because when disaster does strike, FEMA opens up a different stream of money — still under that bigger hazard mitigation umbrella — for future preparedness. The agency allocates 15% of total cost of the disaster’s damages for preventative projects — so the amount of money available, and the timing for when it becomes available, varies greatly. “We need to be able to apply immediately after the disaster,” said Smith. “We have to be ready to go with applications.”BRIC offered a more consistent, annual opportunity for a set amount of money.  For now, the channel for post-disaster hazard mitigation funds remains. But the state is still trying to figure out how to cover the costs for writing the plans it was expecting to update with 2023 BRIC funding. Vermont Emergency Management’s hazard mitigation section does hold onto “a few million dollars” to fill any gaps left behind by FEMA prevention funds, Smith said. Finding ways to move forwardThe state’s Department of Environmental Conservation is one of the few 2023 BRIC recipients that has been able to move forward with the most recent round of funding, since FEMA had already reviewed this grant by the end of 2024. The department’s $183,857 planning grant will go entirely toward modeling landslide risks, state geologist Ben DeJong said. Those models should ultimately save the state from needing to spend on buyouts and cleanups after disaster has already struck, DeJong said. “We have always been more reactive and are hoping, with this work, to take a more proactive stance,” he said.Working with a seasoned modeler at Norwich University, the department plans to create a map that highlights the most landslide-prone areas. Illustrating where soil conditions and sloping terrains can combine with high, sudden precipitation to become particularly dangerous helps inform homebuyers and developers, and can keep them from even building on high-hazard areas in the first place.“Even if we saved one parcel from being built, (this grant) would very quickly pay for itself,” DeJong added, explaining that most individual home buyouts cost the state over $200,000. The entirety of the $183,857 in the BRIC grant will cover the time of an expert modeler at Norwich and one state geological survey staffer who will support the effort to make the final map. In Rockingham, the town will be able to continue its plans to re-size a culvert under Route 121 and Ski Bowl Road without the $44,000 grant it was expecting from BRIC, by pulling from a state structures grant and local highway funds, Municipal Manager Scott Pickup said over email.And, in Wolcott, the work to address Flat Iron Road’s flooding is intended to move forward, thanks to an alternative collaboration with the state Fish & Wildlife Department and other hazard mitigation grants that FEMA is still awarding, explained Linda Martin, the selectboard chair. “If those hazard mitigation grants got pulled, then I’d be really crushed,” Martin said. “So much work goes into one of these grants, hundreds of hours.”Martin said that even if something changes with their backup plan, she hopes to preserve and repurpose the existing grant proposal. “If not, we will just have to be patient and we’ll find funding someday. I’m sure,” Martin said. But across the state, most of this preventative planning work will be left undone, Smith said. “These are not things that communities are required to do,” she said. “These are things that communities are opting in to do because they’re being proactive and because they want to reduce their future costs. I think the unfortunate reality is, without funding to do that, communities won’t do these projects, and then the next time we have a flood, it won’t be better, it’ll be worse.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  FEMA ended a grant program designed to help communities prevent disaster damages.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Legislation proposed during this year’s session drove some updates on academic program study and policy changes heard Wednesday by the Iowa Board of Regents.
Iowa Board of Regents Chief Academic Officer Rachel Boon provided an update to the board on efforts to review academic programs at each state university to examine their alignment with state workforce needs.
Board President Sherry Bates directed staff and state universities in the board’s February meeting to commence a study of all academic programs across the three institutions with the goal of compiling a report determining whether each program should be changed, eliminated or kept the same when looking at workforce alignment.

House File 420, which Bates referenced in her directive, would have directed universities to complete the same study for presentation to the General Assembly. The bill passed out of the House Higher Education Committee but did not see House debate.
“We have a significant amount of information and expertise that we’re already amassing and will continue to do so,” Boon said.

A team formed to plan and conduct the study includes board staff and representatives from the University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University, Boon said, and it has met several times already to determine how to compile data and set the parameters for what programs they should scrutinize.
Beyond internal processes, Boon said the team is also working to get in touch with the Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Workforce Development and community colleges to learn more about education and labor needs in the state. The team also plans to connect with the Iowa Business Council and other external partners, Boon said.
Boon said she doesn’t expect to have updates for the board at every one of their meetings before the full report is presented in November, but work on the study will be ongoing.
“The work is underway, and we feel good about being on target to have a really good product to bring forward to you for the November meeting, and (we’re) happy to take questions at any time between now and then,” Boon said.
Regent Christine Hensley said she was especially happy to hear that board staff will work with the Iowa Business Council, which opens up an opportunity for more collaboration between the council and full board.
“This is great information,” Hensley said. “I really appreciate hearing (about) all of the activity and the collaboration you’re working with everybody on, so I’m excited to see what comes back.”
Policy changes reflect legislation 
The board also recommended approval for changes to its policy manual, adding language complying with legislation referred back to the House Higher Education Committee after failing to be taken up in House debate.
House File 270 would have state universities post online certain syllabus information. The board’s Governance, Evaluation and Human Resources Committee provided initial approval to add language to its academic affairs policy requiring institutions post online syllabi information for most undergraduate courses, including course topics, materials and more.
Changes were also proposed for the board’s business and finance policy, adding a section stating the board will not set a rate of tuition increase that exceeds “the average of the three most recently established” Higher Education Price Index inflation indexes, according to the policy.
The price of equipment that institutions must include in their inventory would also increase from $5,000 to $10,000 in the proposal.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A pro-Palestine protest briefly interrupted a Statehouse news conference celebrating the formation of the new bipartisan South Carolina-Israel Caucus, which more than 20 legislators have joined.
Rep. Beth Bernstein, the state’s only Jewish legislator, had just finished highlighting partnerships between South Carolina and Israeli universities — such as Medical University of South Carolina and the Technion Israel Institute of Technology’s joint research in cardiovascular medicine. She also spoke of Israeli-owned businesses across the technology, automotive plastics and agriculture sector that have set up shop in the Palmetto State.
“South Carolina shares a deep and abiding friendship with the people of Israel and welcomes all opportunities to deepen this relationship through cultural, academic and business endeavors,” the Columbia Democrat said Wednesday.
The official announcement of the caucus came a day after the House adopted a resolution that Bernstein introduced recognizing the state’s “friendship and partnership” with Israel.
As Bernstein’s caucus co-chair, Sen. Larry Grooms, stepped to the podium, a man in the crowd yelled out and threw fake money that he referred to as “Zionist blood money.”
“Israel is guilty of war crimes,” Martin Levisen of Charleston repeatedly shouted as law enforcement with the state Department of Public Safety pinned his hands behind his back and forcibly removed him from the second floor of the Statehouse.

“This is exactly why we need to form the Israel-South Carolina Caucus,” said Grooms, a Berkeley County Republican.
Lt. Gov. Pam Evette apologized for the “outburst” to Jewish members in the crowd when it came her turn to speak.
“That is not the sentiment of America; that is not the sentiment of South Carolina,” she said.
(South Carolina was once home to the largest Jewish population in America. A historic Jewish synagogue in Charleston predates American independence by decades.)
Levinsen later told the SC Daily Gazette he was not arrested. Law enforcement called paramedics to Statehouse grounds to make sure he was OK after he had hit his head on the handrail as he resisted going down the stairs.
“I am more than willing to sacrifice my freedom to speak for a people that have no voice and are being massacred,” he said. “It is imperative that people find their voices on this issue we must speak up.”
Other protesters from the Carolina Peace Resource Center, in a statement, called the formation of the South Carolina-Israel Caucus “deeply troubling” in light of the war that broke out between Israel and Palestine after Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
About 1,200 civilians were killed in Israel and Hamas took some 250 hostages, 59 of whom are still being held. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called it “Israel’s 9/11,” referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in America, and pledged to destroy Hamas.
Israel’s air and ground war has killed over 51,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.
“At a time when we should be holding all nations accountable to international norms and human rights, our lawmakers should prioritize the people of South Carolina,” read the statement from the Columbia center. “This is not a friendship; it’s complicity.”
Bills seek to improve safety for South Carolinians as they worship and attend class

Bernstein said the caucus, which officially formed on April 8, has not voted on legislative priorities. But she highlighted several pieces of legislation she has sponsored that meet with the goals she hopes the caucus can achieve.
The first is a bill signed into law by Gov. Henry McMaster last year that codifies a definition of antisemitism into state law.
The second is legislation Bernstein introduced in March that would fund security improvements for churches, synagogues and other religious institutions in South Carolina.
“South Carolina and Israel have long enjoyed a strong and mutually beneficial relationship,” said Anat Sultan-Dadon, consul general of Israel to the Southeastern United States. “Through this caucus, we will strive to further strengthen these ties, foster greater cooperation, explore new opportunities for growth in trade, culture, technology, education and beyond.”
It’s not the first time the Legislature has declared a bond with Israel. In 2011, the House adopted a resolution that was essentially a statement of support on Israel’s right to exist. It declared that Israel “is neither an attacking force nor an occupier of the lands of others.”
Four years later, then-Gov. Nikki Haley signed an anti-boycott measure aimed at barring state agencies from doing business with or investing in companies that boycott products or divest from Israel (though it doesn’t actually reference Israel). At least three dozen other states have since passed similar policies opposing the so-called “boycott, divestment and sanctions” movement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3155-1024x718.jpg,,,2025-04-23 19:07:11.814287

Jeff Landry is pushing an overhaul of the Louisiana Board of Ethics' investigation process while also facing ethics charges brought by the board. (Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry is pushing for dramatic changes to the Louisiana Board of Ethics’ investigation process that was used to charge him in 2023 with breaking the state ethics code. The changes Landry seeks would make it easier for subjects of an ethics complaint – like he is – to avoid charges or a probe into their alleged wrongdoing. 

The proposed modifications are part of a sweeping rewrite of the state ethics code for elected officials and public employees in House Bill 397, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia. 
Beyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials and state employees’ state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates’ public disclosure of financial interests. 
The proposal cleared its first major hurdle Wednesday when the Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee allowed it to go to the floor without any objection or amendments.

Stephen Gelé, Landry’s private lawyer who handles ethics and campaign finance concerns for the governor, helped craft the legislation. He presented the bill alongside Beaullieu in the House committee. 

Gelé is also one of the attorneys defending Landry against ethics board’s charges for not disclosing flights Landry took on a political donor’s plane to and from Hawaii. The ethics board and Landry, through Gelé,  are still in negotiations about the appropriate punishment for the governor’s alleged violation. 
In an interview Wednesday, Gelé said the bill would not affect Landry’s existing ethics case because its changes would only apply to future cases. 

Beaullieu said he brought the bill after hearing complaints about the ethics board’s investigations being “overly aggressive.” Gelé has previously accused the ethics board of bullying people who face complaints. 

If the legislation passes, the ethics board would have a far higher threshold to clear for launching an investigation into potential ethical misconduct. 

Under the bill, an elected official or public employee would be able to avoid an investigation into misconduct if they had “already cured any potential violation” – a standard that critics said was vague and difficult to understand. 

The person facing the investigation could also ask a district court judge to limit or shut down an ethics board probe if the alleged target or a witness in the case might experience “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, undue burden or expense” as a result of the inquiry, according to the bill.

The ethics board would also have to justify an investigation, making the case that the agency’s “limited resources” should be spent on a particular alleged misconduct claim over other cases.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
Likewise, a district judge would only be able to seek relevant information for a case if it’s deemed cost effective for the state, and “the importance of the information sought outweighs the burden of producing the information.”

Steven Procopio, president of the nonpartisan Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, called the proposed rewrite problematic. The changes would give too much leverage to the person facing misconduct allegations, he said. 
“If someone has committed a violation of the ethics code, embarrassment is not a defense,” said Procopio, whose organization advocates for transparency and fairness in state government. 

Barry Erwin, policy director for the nonpartisan Leaders for a Better Louisiana, agreed with Procopio. He complained the proposed new process features too many obstacles before the ethics board could launch an investigation. 
Erwin and Procopio also expressed concerns about the two-thirds vote that would be needed from ethics board members multiple times before any single probe into misconduct could take place. 
Elected officials now have more control over the board than they have had  in years. Landry pushed the legislature in 2024 to upend the makeup of the ethics board membership and give him more influence over it. 

The board used to consist of 11 positions, filled by the governor and legislators from lists of nominees provided by the state’s private university and college leaders. The higher education administrators were involved to insulate the board from political pressure.

Landry and lawmakers passed a law last year that eliminated the private college leaders’ nominees. They also expanded the board to 15 seats, which the governor and legislators fill directly. The governor now picks nine members, and the Senate and House pick three members each. 

This means the governor could potentially block an ethics board investigation through his nine appointees under the new legislation. Only five members need to vote against an investigation for it to be killed. 
Another portion of Beaullieu’s legislation targets the issue that got Landry in trouble with the ethics board – private plane travel. The bill would allow state officials to report trips on private planes as if they are the equivalent of purchasing a business class or coach airplane ticket on a commercial flight. 
Beaullieu’s proposal also eases restrictions on legislators’ travel for state business on private planes provided by political donors or outside organizations. 
Legislators were previously only allowed to accept flights on private planes for public speeches if they were traveling within the United States or Canada. 

If the bill is approved, they will be able to accept private plane travel for government business anywhere in North America or the U.S. territories, including locations in the Caribbean, as long as they are making a public speech, participating in a panel discussion or making a media appearance.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5C5A7038-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-23 19:07:11.814287

Barbara Ballard, D-Lawrence, Rep. Kristey Williams, R-Augusta, and Rep. Bob Lewis, R-Garden City, take part in the first meeting of the House Select Committee on Government Oversight on Wednesday at the Capitol. The inaugural meeting of the 13-member committee focused on financial issues tied to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, serving nearly 100,000 households in Kansas. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The payment error rate for Kansas’ determination of eligibility for food assistance grew to more than 12% in 2023 to exceed the national average and surpass levels in four state’s neighboring Kansas.
The U.S. average that year was 11.6% and the border states ranged from 7% in Nebraska, 8.6% in Colorado, 10.5% in Missouri and 10.6% in Oklahoma.
Kansas’ problem with processing applications from low-income families, older adults and people with disabilities in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, was brought to the attention of Gov. Laura Kelly in a February 2024 letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Kelly administration received another letter in early April from the USDA pointing to SNAP processing deficiencies in Kansas.
The notices took issue with the state’s SNAP payment error rate as well as the timeliness of application processing and procedural error rates that failed to comply with basic federal requirements.
State officials told the House Select Committee on Government Oversight the error rate in terms of eligibility and benefit determinations for SNAP ranged from 3.8% to 7.1% from 2017 to 2019. In each of those three years the state outperformed the national average.
USDA didn’t track state-by-state performance in 2020 and 2021 due to distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, officials with the Kansas Department for Children and Families, which administers SNAP statewide, said the payment error rate climbed to 12% in 2023 before improving to 10.1% in 2024 and slumping to 11.6% in 2025.
“I know government is different from business, but typically a payment error is pretty critical,” said Rep. Francis Awerkamp, a St. Marys Republican. “Most businesses, as far accounts payable, your error rate you kind of want it to be around zero. This is a $400 million-plus program looking at an 11% error rate. From my perspective, that is a high percentage.”
Carla Whiteside-Hicks, director of economic and employment services for DCF, said the rate was most frequently tied to DCF personnel making data entry mistakes when handling applications for SNAP. For example, she said, mistakes were made in calculation of an applicant’s income or rent. Another area in which inaccuracies surfaced was in the interpretation of self-employment income by an applicant, she said.
“Those are the three that are the most common,” said Whiteside-Hicks, who would prefer the error rate stabilized at 3%.
“As they enter this data — this is an application form where I’m asking questions and entering data — we’re making errors on some of the most basic elements of the application such as income, rent and self-employment,” Awerkamp said. “How would you approach correcting these errors?”
Whiteside-Hicks said DCF’s effort to minimize mistakes centered on improving training of staff and upgrading training materials used by about 200 state workers responsible for processing SNAP applications. She said regional offices involved in the application process had historically struggled to hire staff.
“It takes at least a year to become proficient as an eligibility worker,” Whiteside-Hicks said.
Rep. Will Carpenter, R-El Dorado, said the status report on processing SNAP applications should prompt the Legislature to examine how other states dealt with processing requests for food aid.
“Are there states that contract their eligibility out as a piece versus having in-house employees?” he said.
Tanya Keys, deputy secretary at DCF, told legislators SNAP provided a monthly benefit that averaged $189 per person or $392 per family in Kansas. As of last year, Kansas provided SNAP benefits to 97,000 households.
In terms of eligibility for SNAP, she said, Kansas had placed in law a part-time work requirement or training participation requirement for adults 18 to 54 without children. That criteria could be waived for an adult caring for children, a person with a disability or an individual at least 60 years of age.
Keys said one-third of SNAP participants in Kansas were enrolled in the program for less than six months and two-thirds were in the program less than one year.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, authorized the House Select Committee on Government Oversight to monitor the functioning, transparency and accountability of government agencies. He granted the 13-member committee subpoena power to investigate potential misconduct.
“This committee’s work will help ensure that public funds are used efficiently and that government actions align with the best interests of the citizens of Kansas,” Hawkins said.
During the first meeting of the committee on Wednesday at the Capitol, Augusta GOP Rep. Kristey Williams, chair of the bipartisan panel, said topics of inquiry weren’t set in stone.
“We are not here to create drafts of bills, but we are here to really shine a light on any issues that are of high importance,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/House-government-oversight-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 19:07:11.814287

(Photo courtesy of Last Energy)The Louisiana Legislature is working to speed up the permitting process to allow small nuclear reactors to be added to the state’s portfolio of energy production. Although the technology is not yet in use in the United States, proponents see it as a low-emissions option to provide electricity in areas that struggle to get reliable power.
Energy analysts say there are reasons why what are known as small modular reactors (SMRs) have not caught on yet in America – chief among them is the cost.    
Senate Bill 127, by Sen. Adam Bass, R-Bossier City, would allow the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to create an expedited environmental permitting process for building small modular reactors. That would position the state to be ready when the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows the projects to move forward. The bill advanced out of the Senate Committee on Environmental Quality and heads next to the full Senate.
“You have companies in states like Texas that are starting that process,” LDEQ Secretary Aurelia Skipwith Giacometto said Tuesday at the State Capitol after the Senate committee hearing on Bass’ bill. 
Supporters of the proposal hope SMRs can be used by not only utilities but also industrial facilities that need an exclusive, on-site power source. Gov. Jeff Landry has included nuclear energy as part of an “all of the above” approach he supports to meet the state’s power needs.
Sizing up SMRs
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, small modular reactors range from one-tenth to one-fourth the size of a standard nuclear reactor. They can produce between 10-300 megawatts of power. That’s compared to an estimated 2,142 megawatts Entergy reports its two nuclear plants in Louisiana generate combined. 
The cost to build small nuclear reactors is steep. A study last year from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found the cost to construct an SMR averaged $25,000 per kilowatt generated as of 2023 – more than double the rate in 2015. 
For a 10-megawatt reactor – the power level for the smallest SMR – the total cost comes to about $250 million.      
Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that in order for utilities to buy into small nuclear reactors, it will take government subsidies and tax credits to make the cost worthwhile. 
“If you’re trying to make them smaller, they’re gonna be less economic unless you come up with some way to compensate for this penalty for making them smaller,” Lyman told the Illuminator in a phone interview. “… There’s no one in the world that’s ordering SMRs in the amounts that would be needed to start to see the benefit of central manufacturing.”
Lyman noted there are two current applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for new nuclear reactors in the U.S, and both “are half-funded by the federal government and the other half funded by rich people like Bill Gates.” 
“So there’s actually a lot less going on that meets the eye, and again, the bottom line is cost …” he said. “Utilities and users know how expensive these things are.”
After a strong of nuclear power plant shutdowns in recent decades, there has been a push to bring them back online to address increasing energy needs. This momentum has carried over to introduce SMRs in the United States.
Gartias said there is industry interest in placing SMRs near petrochemical plants to reduce their carbon footprint by using nuclear power to run the plants and offset some of their emissions. Although nuclear plants do not produce carbon dioxide, their critics note their environmental impact in the form of uranium mining and waste storage. 
Waste and billing questions
The Alliance for Affordable Energy, a Louisiana-based consumer advocacy group, is not taking a stance on the Bass bill but wants more answers on who will pay for small modular reactor projects – and whether those costs will be passed down to ratepayers. 
“We stopped building nuclear for a long time, but now there are really vague and not very recent examples of us building nuclear on time and on budget,” Jackson Voss, the alliance’s climate policy coordinator, told the Illuminator.
When asked by committee member Sen. Patrick Connick, R-Marrero, what would happen to the waste created by small modular reactors, Bass did not give a clear answer. He said some companies use the waste to generate more power. Connick said he wants more information about the waste before the next vote on the bill on the Senate floor, which has not been scheduled yet. 
There are no current proposals to place SMRs in Louisiana. A few projects in other states are under licensing review with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the first are projected to be built within the next 10 years. 
Louisiana recently joined several states in suing the federal government to loosen its regulations around nuclear power. The lawsuit claims blanket rules are not equal for reactors that vary in size. SMRs are safer and create less nuclear waste, so they should have different regulations from the full-sized reactors, the plaintiff states argue.
“Ultimately, if you’re looking at what we are doing on the legislative side, see what we are doing when it comes to litigation, that puts in companies’ eyes that Louisiana is a desirable state” for nuclear power, Giacometto said. 
Giacometto said the governor is onboard with the lawsuit.

Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County was at the center of debate Wednesday on the legislative floor. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill that would extend an expanded eligibility threshold for Nebraska food benefits has advanced to its final lawmaking round, but not before a latecomer amendment that some described as hostile was debated and defeated.
Legislative Bill 192, by State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, calls for the elimination of an October expiration on Nebraska’s current eligibility levels for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Right now, a key qualifier for households is if gross income is at or below 165% of the federal poverty level.
If the Quick bill fails, the lower pre-pandemic income eligibility level of 130% of gross income is set to return.
The SNAP program helps qualified recipients buy groceries. The federal government pays 100% of program benefits, and 50% of administrative costs.
 ‘Shoulda put a ring on it’

The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the program, estimated that more than 4,000 families that otherwise might be disqualified because of income could remain on SNAP if the eligibility threshold is maintained.

LB 192, which State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha made his priority this session, ultimately advanced Tuesday by a voice vote and now moves on to a third and final reading.
The bulk of debate came after State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County tried to attach an amendment essentially mirroring his LB 656, which would prohibit DHHS from seeking federal waivers that make exceptions to SNAP work requirements, such as living in areas with high unemployment. 
Andersen said his proposal still would retain certain exceptions, including for caregivers of a child with disabilities, students enrolled at least half-time and teens ages 16 to 18 who are in training programs. But generally, he said, he wants able-bodied SNAP recipients to work. 
  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln led opposition to Andersen’s amendment, peppering him with questions about rationale and cost. 
While a previous fiscal analysis of Andersen’s LB 656 came with an estimated price tag of more than $2.2 million next fiscal year, Andersen told colleagues Wednesday that DHHS officials more recently told him expenses could be absorbed into their existing budget.
That’s because instead of requiring DHHS officials to help find work for impacted SNAP recipients, the agency “may” help provide assignments.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha said the Andersen amendment represented an approach she has seen this session of “demonizing” and “dehumanizing” the working class. 
Some Democratic lawmakers took issue with Andersen’s late and “hostile” amendment to someone else’s bill, which Quick also opposed.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 19, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha invoked the lyrics of Beyoncé — “If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it” —  to drive home her point that he should have “prioritized” the effort as his own legislation. 
While Andersen’s LB 656 was advanced out of a legislative committee and onto full debate by the Legislature, it was not prioritized and therefore is unlikely to be debated this session on its own.
 ‘Good governance’ 

Some Republicans, however, defended Andersen’s tactic as not extraordinary and said they supported his goal.
  Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said that if Andersen’s amendment would add no state cost, he was supportive.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair said he saw Andersen’s effort to ratchet up work requirements for the SNAP program as compatible and a “good compromise” to Quick’s effort to extend current eligibility levels. Hansen has brought similar legislation in the past.
Hansen noted he was the only member of the Health and Human Services Committee who voted against pushing Quick’s LB 192 out of the committee stage and onto the legislative floor.
“I think that’s good governance,” Hansen said of the Andersen amendment, which ultimately failed 22-14, three votes short. “To say that it’s not, maybe I’m missing the point.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Daniela Pintor-Mendoza stood up before the Iowa Board of Regents Wednesday, a crowd of people holding signs and waving flags behind her.
She spoke during the board’s public comment period to express her feelings as a “proud” University of Iowa student about decisions made by the board to reduce diversity, equity and inclusion practices at state universities.
Directing universities to wipe DEI information from websites and course curriculum directly opposes the board’s mission to be a steward of quality instruction, research and service to Iowans, she said.
“These actions are not just policy shifts,” Pintor-Mendoza said. “They are an attack on the values of fairness, success, access and representation.”

A coalition of Iowa State University and University of Iowa students used public comment and protests outside of the ISU Alumni Center to raise their voices against the Iowa Board of Regents’ actions diminishing diversity, equity and inclusion and creating other negative impacts on their campuses.
Students at both institutions have held protests against anti-DEI measures before, calling on the board and their administrations to support students of color, LGBTQ+ students and others rather than push them to the side at the behest of the state and federal government.
Pintor-Mendoza ended her comments with “collective demands” from her and other students feeling the hurt from eliminated programs and uncertainty from federal actions.
They included maintaining funding and support for critical services like multicultural and LGBTQ+ student centers, ensuring those offices are staffed and operating, providing “full transparency” in DEI compliance processes, guaranteeing university employees can still conduct optional DEI activities and including it in coursework without penalty, committing to ending job cuts due to closing DEI programs, creating a student oversight committee for DEI policy changes, giving aid to international students who have seen their visas revoked and protecting free speech.
ISU student Binx Hilton said teachers are censoring themselves in class and course materials out of fear of saying something the board or the government wouldn’t like, as they are unsure about what can and can’t be taught.
“Teachers have no directives, no protections right now … and you are the only thing that stands between unchecked federal regulations and our universities, our professors, our students and our programs,” Hilton said. “Stand between it.”
Darrell Washington, also a UI student, said erasing DEI education and support for students is a choice the board is making to “scrub our histories, our identities, our truths, out of the curriculum, out of existence,” and to ignore students and their needs.
Taking away LGBTQ+ and multicultural centers cuts away students’ foundations and leaves them without a sanctuary, Washington said, and it tells them they don’t matter.
“We are not asking for special treatment,” Washington said. “We are asking for our rightful place at the table, because we have built this table, we bring the chairs and we will not be pushed away. We are not invisible, we are not optional. We are not leaving.”
Graciela Rangel, the last student to speak during the public comment period, urged the board to not preemptively comply with rules that are not yet set in stone and that hurt the communities they’re supposed to serve.
Programs Rangel said made an ISU education possible are on “shaky ground” right now or gone entirely, like the LGBTQ+ center on campus. When students and staff are choosing to pack up and leave their universities, Rangel said, it’s more important than ever for board members to show their commitment to students and university employees.
“Now more than ever, I need you to understand the importance of standing with your students and staff,” Rangel said. “Let me repeat — anticipatory obedience to unjust policies and oppressive ideologies is not a sign of ethical leadership.”

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Oregon is leading 11 other states in suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the U.S.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed Wednesday by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
Rayfield plans to discuss the suit with reporters later this afternoon.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont as well as Oregon— are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China; a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico; and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Attorney General’s Office.
“When a president pushes an unlawful policy that drives up prices at the grocery store and spikes utility bills, we don’t have the luxury of standing by — especially when so many Oregonians live on fixed incomes,” Rayfield said in the news release.
Rayfield and the attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the Executive Branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University
 Feeling the pain

Both Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small and medium business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky’s senior U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as next week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Two months after setting a goal to permit 15,000 new homes within five years, Rhode Island housing officials have unveiled their road map to get there.
The vision is detailed in the Housing 2030 plan, which includes a call for the state to permit a minimum of 1,000 new homes priced below $400,000 each and build 1,695 new middle-market units. Additionally, the plan seeks to triple the number of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) permitted, increase multifamily homes by 50%, and finance 2,250 affordable rental units.
It’s an ambitious plan, Gov. Dan McKee acknowledged during a State House press conference with Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard Wednesday afternoon. But he said change is needed after decades of stagnation.
“When housing production does not meet demand, and it has not met demand in some time, it puts a roadblock in what we call the road to prosperity,” McKee said. 
The 76-page plan by the Department of Housing is still in draft form. Public comment will be open online through May 23, after which state officials will consider making any changes before final approval. A final plan will likely be published in the fall, Goddard told reporters.
Housing Department spokesperson Emily Marshall told Rhode Island Current the 2030 plan is designed to ensure “that at least a certain number of units are created in each category.” More affordable homes may be added to the state’s goal based on ongoing housing needs, she added. 
The Rhode Island Department of Housing’s plan notes home prices have increased 65% and rental prices have increased 60% since 2018, while wages have increased only 29%.  From 2022-2024, less than 21% of new construction homes for sale were priced below $400,000, according to the 2030 plan.
All the while, few new homes have been permitted for construction. Between 2019 and 2023, fewer than 8,500 new homes received required state and local permits to begin construction in Rhode Island, according to a presentation from the Department of Housing.
A lot of the blame still lies on local zoning ordinances that favor single-family homes and prevent higher density structures from being built. State leaders have sought to reduce the red tape through legislative action over recent years, but some towns just haven’t been on board.
Municipal leaders in Johnston, where about 7.9% of housing units are considered affordable, have pushed back against denser apartment buildings, citing concerns that an influx of families — and students — could strain local school systems and impact municipal budgets. Towns like Narragansett, where about 3.8% of housing units are considered affordable, have repeatedly blocked development of affordable multi-family homes because of potential impact on the “character” of the town.
So what can the state do to get more towns on board? Set housing targets that make sense for each municipality, according to the Housing 2030 plan.
“We have not taken a one-size fits all approach,” Goddard said.
The 2030 plan calls for the Department of Housing and the Division of Statewide Planning to look over each community’s comprehensive plans — the guiding documents for each municipality’s zoning and land use. Cities and towns will be required to modify plans if they do not provide a realistic path forward for the achievement of housing production goals, according to the state’s proposal.
Community leaders will be required to provide annual progress reports to the Department of Housing, showing what policy changes they followed through on, how many homes were actually built, and explaining any setbacks or issues they ran into.

Carrot approach
Goddard told reporters her intention is for the state to reward communities that meet goals by giving them  higher priority for state grants or infrastructure funds.
“It’s a carrot, but it’s a nicely disguised hammer in some way,” Goddard said.
Municipalities would also be provided with technical assistance on how to reform their local zoning codes and expedite permitting.
Randy Rossi, director of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns, said in a statement Wednesday that municipal leaders are firmly committed to supporting responsible housing development. “More housing can be built when policies reflect the community needs and financial and technical support is available,” Rossi said.
Philip Tedesco, CEO of the Rhode Island Association of Realtors, said the plan will rely on a willingness to collaborate. nts.
“Local municipalities, legislators, and stakeholder groups will need to work together in determining revised zoning and development regulations, financial incentives, opportunities for revitalization, and more,” Tedesco said in a statement. 
Goddard said she believed smaller towns will fall in line and that the state will meet its goal of 15,000 new homes.
“We’re going to have to keep pushing, but it’s doable,” she said in an interview.
HousingWorks RI Director Brenda Clement was a bit more skeptical. She said it may not be possible amid continued uncertainty over federal funding toward housing projects.
“A lot of what we’re funding are with recovery funding and that’s all going to disappear,” she said in an interview after the press conference. “I am glad there is a plan, but plans are only as good as our implementation of them.”
Rhode Island Builders Association CEO John V. Marcantonio said he believes the state’s plan for 15,000 new homes is possible if state and local leaders are committed to addressing the housing crisis.
“If the plan is to move forward, then it would be our objective to put the bodies in place to do that,” Marcantonio said in a phone interview. “There’s a lot of people that want to solve this problem — I think Rhode Island could be a leader on how to solve this issue.

A 3rd District Court judge declared on Friday the program is unconstitutional. But, for Republican Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leadership, this isn’t the end of the road. After the ruling was unveiled they said they would appeal to the state’s high court to overturn the decision.

“It is in everyone’s interest to move as expeditiously as possible in the Supreme Court,” Ramya Ravindran, an attorney representing the UEA, said on Wednesday. “We wouldn’t oppose delaying the request for the injunction until we receive the guidance back from the Supreme Court.”
That’s one of the simplest ways to go about the case, Judge Laura Scott said. If the high court affirms her ruling, then Utah Fits All would be discontinued. If justices reverse it, the case would be dismissed.
Utah Fits All voucher program is ‘unconstitutional,’ district court rules

“I will not impose a remedy at this point, so I’ll issue the final ruling. It will go up on appeal. There will be no injunction in place,” Scott said. “My understanding is that would mean things would just proceed as normal and then listen until we have a decision by the Supreme Court.” 
After a year-long legal challenge against the school choice program, Scott ruled it to be unconstitutional since it is not open to all Utah children and diverts income tax revenue to fund private schools, violating articles X and XIII of the Utah constitution. 
The UEA is still celebrating the win despite not yet having a final resolution. UEA President Renée Pinkney said in a statement on Wednesday that the lower court ruling affirms that public money belongs in public schools, and she’s confident the decision will be upheld on appeal.
“In the meantime, the plaintiffs agreed to allow public funds already allocated under the program to remain in place until the Utah Supreme Court issues a final ruling. This approach prevents immediate disruption for private and homeschool students and ensures public school educators continue receiving the pay increase tied to the program,” Pinkney said. 
While on the other side of the aisle, Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman also had reasons to celebrate after the Wednesday conference.

The program, established in 2023, provided up to $8,000 a year in scholarships for private school tuition or homeschool instruction per student. This year the Legislature appropriated over $100 million in ongoing funds for Utah Fits All. 
But the extra funding came with more restrictions for the program, which is mostly used by homeschooled children. Lawmakers approved reducing scholarship amounts for homeschooled students to $4,000 a year for students ages 5 to 11 and $6,000 for ages 12 to 18. Those attending private schools can still receive $8,000 a year. 
Bans were also put in place on expenses like ski passes, furniture and musical instruments, a cap of 20% per scholarship was set for extracurriculars and physical education, and a clear process was provided to change the program administrator, which the State Board of Education already used when it terminated its contract with ACE Scholarships early.
However, some claims for relief included in the suit were rendered moot by Scott’s ruling, including the argument that the program violated the constitution “by vesting control and supervision of a public education program in a private program manager and prohibiting the Board from promulgating any rules concerning instructional content and curriculum in voucher-funded schools,” and another claim that challenged “delegating an essential public service, and one of the Legislature’s core constitutional functions” to private entities.
However, as requested by the state attorneys, Scott will take a couple of weeks to rule on those claims so the Utah Supreme Court appeal has a complete decision for the case to review. That decision will not come later than May 15, she added.

To stave off large health insurance premium increases, Vermont’s health care system needs to save $200 million. Can it do so in time?

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger$200 million.That’s the figure Vermont’s health care system needs to save — very quickly — in order to hold Vermont health insurance premium increases to around 5% next year, according to the Green Mountain Care Board. If those savings don’t materialize in the next few months, insurance premiums for residents and small businesses could increase by around 15% to 20% in 2026, if not more, board member Jessica Holmes told lawmakers Wednesday morning.That means, in order to keep care at least remotely affordable for Vermonters, the state’s hospitals, primary, specialty and long-term care providers need to transform — and quickly.  “This is really tough to hear, and I recognize that, but I think Vermonters cannot afford the health care system that we currently have,” Holmes said.On Wednesday, health care leaders came to a joint meeting of the Senate and House health care committees with a message: we are working on it. CEOs of three rural hospitals — Gifford Health Care, Springfield Hospital and North Country Hospital — laid out their efforts to cut costs, which include eliminating certain services, trimming staff and pooling resources with neighboring providers.And Brendan Krause, Vermont’s Director of Health Care Reform at the Agency of Human Services, showed lawmakers the framework of a roughly eight-month plan in which the agency would meet with providers around the state and offer “technical assistance” to help with “administrative cost reduction and streamlining of medical services, etc.,” Krause said. But to multiple lawmakers in the room, those efforts appeared neither effective nor urgent enough to save that $200 million — and stave off ruinous premium hikes.Without greater collaboration and coordination across the health care ecosystem, Rep. Topper McFaun, R-Barre Town, said, “all the discussion that you’re having — let’s be honest, it’s not working.”Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, the chair of Senate Health and Welfare, concurred.“We can’t wait for change to happen,” she said. “We need to direct the change.” —Peter D’AuriaIn the knowVermont Attorney General Charity Clark is joining the top prosecutors of 11 other states in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, the Attorney General’s office announced Wednesday.The attorneys general, who filed the lawsuit Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York City, argue that Trump’s four executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from other countries violate Article I of the U.S. Constitution, which assigns Congress, not the president, the “Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”“President Trump’s illegal tariffs will harm Vermont’s businesses and consumers,” Clark said in a Wednesday press release announcing the suit. “I’m suing the Trump Administration for the tenth time over these illegal tariffs to protect working Vermonters, small businesses, and our economy.”The lawsuit requests a preliminary and permanent injunction blocking U.S. Customs and Border Patrol from enforcing the tariffs. Read more about the new lawsuit here. — Habib SabetService journalism Last week, this newsletter broke the huge story that Google was incorrectly displaying the words “Comité Olímpico de Portugal” atop many Vermont state documents in its search results. Just after that edition of Final Reading was published, Google fixed the problem, according to the Agency of Digital Services.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed a library content bill, calling it “a misguided attempt to legislate morality through overreach and censorship.”
The Republican said in a veto message Wednesday that Senate Bill 2307 is redundant with legislation approved two years ago and is overly burdensome for librarians, school districts and state’s attorneys.
“The bill imposes vague and punitive burdens on professionals and opens the door to a host of unintended and damaging consequences for our communities,” Armstrong said.
  Gov. Kelly Armstrong
The bill narrowly passed the Senate and the House, making it unlikely that lawmakers would have enough votes to override the veto.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, sought to require school and public libraries to remove content deemed “sexually explicit” to areas not easily accessible to children. It also proposed that local state’s attorneys would investigate and prosecute violations, and state funds could be withheld from schools or libraries in violation. 
The state estimated it would cost $2 million in the first four years to implement the bill by adding an age-verification system for an online database used by North Dakota libraries. Local state’s attorneys and libraries would likely see additional costs, according to testimony on the bill.
Armstrong called the process in the bill “completely unworkable.” He raised concerns about books such as “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank, “The Kite Runner” and “1984” as other books that have been targeted by obscenity laws.
“I don’t pretend to know what the next literary masterpiece is going to be,” Armstrong wrote. “But I know that I want it available in a library.”
About 1,000 people participated in silent protests at 17 libraries around the state in March to show their opposition to the bill.
More than 2,000 people sent Armstrong messages urging him to veto the bill through an action alert by Right to Read ND, a nonpartisan group that opposed the bill. The group argued that the bill is unnecessary, expensive and violates First Amendment rights. 
“This veto protects teachers and librarians in North Dakota from frivolous lawsuits and ensures they can continue to provide quality library services to their local communities,” said Randi Monley and Mariah Ralston, Right to Read ND co-chairs, in a joint statement. “We hope the North Dakota Legislature will also listen to their constituents’ concerns and sustain the governor’s veto.”
Opponents also said libraries already have local review processes for content that is challenged.
During hearings on the bill, supporters pointed to examples of books that were challenged at local libraries but not removed. Rep. Mike Brandenburg, R-Edgeley, said his constituents wanted lawmakers to take action on library content, citing a book from the “Heartstopper” LGBTQ+ graphic novel series that some parents objected to in the Forman school library.
Former Gov. Doug Burgum vetoed a similar library content bill in the 2023 legislative session, but signed another one that required sexually explicit content to be removed from children’s sections.
Lawmakers would need 32 votes in the Senate and 63 votes in the House to override Armstrong’s veto. The bill passed on a 27-20 vote in the Senate and 49-45 vote in the House.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida legislators are poised to pass a law that makes it clear that state government can’t kick out Medicaid beneficiaries with physical or intellectual disabilities absent a material change in the individual’s disability or economic status that affects eligibility.
The bill stems from the recent Medicaid unwinding from the Covid-19 pandemic. A House staff analysis of the bill shows that between April 2023 and February 2025, “approximately 534 disabled individuals lost Medicaid coverage because they failed to provide information requested by the DCF [Department of Children and Families] to make an eligibility determination.”
The analysis continues: “The number of individuals who may have remained eligible for had they submitted the requested information to the DCF is unknown. During the same period, approximately 3,357 disabled individuals lost Medicaid coverage due to not meeting income and asset eligibility requirements.”
The House passed  HB 1227 unanimously Wednesday. The identical Senate companion bill SB 7032, is on the Senate calendar which means it can be taken up for consideration during session.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)At least 10 international students at South Dakota’s public universities have reported their visas canceled this year, according to the South Dakota Board of Regents.
Two other reported cancellations were for former students in a program that allows student visa holders to work temporarily in jobs directly related to their field of study. A visa is a document showing a foreigner’s permission to visit, work or study in the country.
Board of Regents spokeswoman Shuree Mortenson did not identify which of the state’s six public institutions the students attended. A Dakota State University spokeswoman told South Dakota Searchlight, however, that no visa cancellations have been reported by any of the Madison school’s 198 international students.
Noem’s DHS will require migrants without legal status to register with U.S. government

The public has been privy to the details in just one of the cases, that of Indian doctoral candidate Priya Saxena. She sued Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem to prevent any action that would block Saxena from collecting her Ph.D. in chemical and biological engineering on May 10 from South Dakota Mines.
Last week, U.S. District Judge Karen Schreier ordered DHS to reinstate Saxena’s student status and leave her be, at least until the judge makes a call on whether to issue a further-reaching preliminary injunction in the case.
On the day Saxena would collect her degree at Mines, Noem will deliver the commencement speech at DSU. A news release from the school, sent Wednesday morning, notes that Noem was extended the invitation to speak while she was still governor of South Dakota, a position she vacated to lead DHS. 
Saxena’s plight was one of the motivations for about 25 people who demonstrated Wednesday outside City Hall in Rapid City, as part of a protest led by Indivisible Rapid City to “call attention to the increasing disregard for basic constitutional protections — especially the right to due process, which applies to all people, not just U.S. citizens.”
Demonstrator Pat Braun held a sign referencing student visa holders and said she is upset that Saxena was targeted.
“It’s so ill-informed, so mean-spirited, so ugly,” Braun said.
South Dakota part of nationwide crackdown
The cancellations in South Dakota are among a crush of visa-policing actions taken by the Trump administration as part of a wider push to tighten immigration enforcement, including an uptick in arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants.
The president issued two executive orders impacting student visas on Jan. 20. One directed DHS and the U.S. State Department to review and revoke the visas of international students engaged in what the order called “anti-Semetic” behavior. The order swept up students critical of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas, including a Turkish woman attending Tufts University who penned a pro-Palestine opinion column, and whose apprehension by agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement was captured on a widely shared video.
The other executive order directs federal agencies to review visa programs more broadly, and instructs DHS Secretary Noem to “take immediate steps to exclude or remove” anyone in the U.S. who might be considered a threat to public safety.
Issues with visas or legal status have since befallen more than 1,000 students nationwide, The Associated Press reported last week. The wire service compiled the figure using statements from schools and state officials. Another outlet, Inside Higher Education, puts the figure at 1,700.
Several students or groups of students have sued the administration over the visa actions. On the same day Saxena was given a reprieve in her South Dakota case, a federal judge in Georgia signed a similar order meant to temporarily reinstate the student status of 133 international students.
South Dakota students
South Dakota Searchlight reached out to the Board of Regents and representatives of the state’s six public universities to inquire about visa status changes. The most recent report from the regents lists 2,233 international students in the state. 
Noem cheers court order requiring immigrants without legal status to register and carry documents

Northern State University and the University of South Dakota did not respond. The schools that did, aside from DSU in Madison, said in statements that their respective international student offices are offering visa guidance to students as needed.
In her statement on behalf of the regents, Mortenson said that “our universities are not directly involved in this process.” 
“However, with less than three weeks remaining in the spring semester, we will assist affected students with their academic efforts to the best of our ability,” she wrote.
Searchlight also reached out to Augustana University, the state’s largest private four-year school, whose spokesperson said its international students had not been affected.
Federal information limited
In separate statements to South Dakota Searchlight, the DHS and State Department declined to say how many foreign students in South Dakota have had visas revoked.
The State Department issues visas for international students. It revokes visas “every day,” its statement read, and “will continue to do so.”
“When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under U.S. immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,” the statement read. “This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.”
DHS doesn’t issue visas, but is involved on the enforcement and monitoring side. It maintains the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database created after the 9/11 attacks and used to validate an international student’s ability to study in the U.S. 
Schools must re-register international students through SEVIS each semester to verify that they’re fulfilling visa requirements. Schools can terminate the SEVIS record if a student violates their visa terms by, for example, not enrolling in a full course of study. 
An international student with a visa needs a SEVIS record set to “active” status to attend school.
The recent SEVIS record terminations have come by way of Noem’s federal agency, not from schools.
A DHS spokesperson wrote that it “conducts regular reviews” of SEVIS records “to ensure visa holders remain in compliance with program requirements.”
If an issue is flagged, including “criminal arrests and other national security concerns,” the statement says, DHS may notify the State Department, which may revoke a student’s visa. “Individuals who remain in the U.S. without lawful immigration status may be subject to arrest and removal,” the statement reads. “For such individuals, the safest and most efficient option is self-deportation.”
Mines student targeted over Sturgis rally traffic violation
The revocation for Saxena, the doctoral candidate at South Dakota Mines, came after a “criminal records check,” according to documents filed in her lawsuit against Noem and the DHS.
Grant cancellation means children have to ‘defend themselves’ in immigration court, advocate says

Saxena learned of the revocation through the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi on April 7, six days after she defended her doctoral thesis, according to documents filed with her lawsuit.
Conviction for a “crime of moral turpitude,” a category that includes offenses like driving under the influence, can be grounds for visa revocation.
Saxena has been in the U.S. since 2020. Her only criminal conviction came in 2021, for the class two misdemeanor of failure to move over for flashing yellow lights. She was ticketed for driving under the influence during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, but the charge didn’t hold up. 
A blood test put her blood alcohol content on the evening of the stop at 0.06, which is below South Dakota’s 0.08 legal threshold for intoxication. Prosecutors dismissed the DUI charge. 
Judge Schreier heard details about the incident during a Friday hearing on Saxena’s request for an emergency temporary restraining order.
Later that day, the judge ordered DHS to “set aside” its decision to mark Saxena’s visa status as terminated, to return her SEVIS record to “active” status and to refrain from taking any enforcement action against her until May 2, or until “further order from the court.”
The doctoral candidate faced “irreparable harm” if DHS moved forward, Schreier wrote.
Saxena’s lawyer, Jim Leach of Rapid City, decried the federal government’s actions against international students as “government gone wild.”
Saxena has authored or co-authored a dozen peer-reviewed papers in her field, a point Leach added to the initial complaint in her lawsuit. That’s the kind of person South Dakota and the U.S. ought to treasure, Leach said, not toss out for a traffic violation. 
“The great things we have in this country are built on knowledge, on information,” Leach said. “They’re built by smart people like her, who can do the Ph.D. stuff in chemical and biological engineering that I never could have done.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate) Arkansas education leaders praised components of a new higher education overhaul law that will help high schoolers transition to college and reaffirmed their commitment to supporting all students during a roundtable discussion at the Fayetteville Town Center Wednesday. 
University of Central Arkansas President Houston Davis, NorthWest Arkansas Community College President Dennis Rittle and University of Arkansas Chancellor Charles Robinson participated in the conversation, which was organized by the Northwest Arkansas Council and focused on higher education’s role in workforce and regional development. 
“We’re not talking about degrees, we’re talking about making sure that students have the skills that they need that are marketable and that align with our regional economies whether it’s here or Central Arkansas or otherwise,” NWA Council President Nelson Peacock told a crowd of roughly 350 guests. 
Workforce preparedness has been a priority for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who in March signed into law Arkansas ACCESS, a 123-page bill that will make changes to the state’s higher education funding model, scholarships, course credits and the admissions process, among other things. 
What is Arkansas ACCESS?

Participants considered the impact of Act 341 throughout the hour-long conversation, including Davis. He said he appreciated the legislation’s connections between K-12 and post-secondary education, which he said will make university officials think about how to reach out to feeder schools and make sure they’re removing barriers. 
Additionally, Davis said he appreciated the legislation’s support for noncredit activities, such as the coding and aviation academies offered at UCA. 
“Knowing that the state has a nod toward and there’s a place for that and there’s encouragement for universities and community colleges to be in that noncredit space, I think that’s a win for workforce, that’s a win for business and industry,” Davis said. 
Robinson lauded Arkansas ACCESS’ support of concurrent credit courses, which he said would better prepare students for post-graduation activities. Robinson also praised doubling the first-year award for the Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarship Program to $2,000.
“I know the state was doing what it thought was right, but that $1,000 doesn’t cover books,” he said. “So you need more money going to kids early on, and hopefully we’ll continue to look for ways to increase the support from the state for the students, because again, that helps them to be able to afford the opportunity that they’re seeking to better themselves and ultimately to better the state.”
Colleges and universities are also taking steps to increase access to higher education through their own scholarships. The University of Arkansas, for example, announced Wednesday a $1 million donation by alumnus Will Feland to the Land of Opportunity Scholarship campaign, a three-year initiative to increase educational access for students from the state’s 75 counties “by addressing the critical funding gap often limiting those opportunities,” according to a press release.
Roundtable participants were also asked about some of the more controversial components of Arkansas ACCESS, which include prohibitions on excused absences for college students who attend political protests and collecting and reporting information about diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) for institutional accreditation purposes.  
In terms of free speech, Robinson said he didn’t see the challenge in the new law because academic freedom wasn’t injured and the legislation “doesn’t prevent us from teaching what we need to teach.” 
Regarding DEI, the new higher education law prohibits things like requiring students and staff to submit a diversity statement or conditioning enrollment based on race, ethnicity, sex, color or national origin. While that may be happening in other institutions around the country, it’s not an issue at UCA, according to Davis, who said “those elements of the bill make something illegal that we’re not doing already.”

Critics of the law’s prohibitions on “indoctrination” and DEI have voiced concerns about the potential impact on students from minority groups. All 10,000 of UCA’s students are unique individuals, Davis said, and it’s his administration’s job to figure out what about their background makes them special and what they hope to get out of their college experience. 
“A friend of mine…says, ‘no one can tell you you can’t love a student and love who they are and be there for them as they walk their journey,’ and that’s all we’re doing,” Davis said. “And the reality is, if you want to divide that up into 10,000 pieces, go right ahead. We’re going to keep meeting students where they are.” 
Rittle echoed those sentiments, noting that they love their students at NWACC “and when you love them, there’s no laws against that.” 
Progress and change come with challenges, but Rittle said he sees it as an opportunity for reinvention as the school continues serving its students. 
“We don’t get too tripped up [with] what happens in other ways. If you tell me we’ve got to stop doing our mission, that’s a different conversation,” he said. “But as long as we can do our mission, we figure it out and we keep serving. And we have students from every different demographic as well at NWACC, just like all the institutions represented here on this platform, and the reality is our service to them, if anything, it’s just like, game on.”
State Rep. Denise Garner, a Fayetteville Democrat and member of the House Education Committee who attended Wednesday’s discussion, said there were some great parts of Arkansas ACCESS, but she’s also worried about other components of the massive legislation.
“My biggest concern is to make sure we have all of the stakeholders at the table so that we’re making good decisions, and we’ll watch to make sure that happens,” Garner said. 
Details of the law’s various components will be fleshed out during the rulemaking process, which often includes feedback from stakeholders and can take several months to complete.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House advanced an amendment to the Department of Commerce budget Wednesday that would add $50 million in state funding and a $20 million Bank of North Dakota loan for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.
The 53-40 vote followed lengthy discussion, with some members questioning why the $50 million was first introduced last Friday and did not receive a full policy committee hearing. The funding proposed in Senate Bill 2018 would be in addition to $50 million in state funds the Legislature approved in 2019. 
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, who proposed the additional library funding, said the $50 million would only be available if the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation matches it with private donations. The goal is to add to the library’s endowment so interest from the funds could help cover operational costs, he said.
“As we all know, museums just don’t make money,” Nathe said. 
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library crosses construction milestone 

Construction of the library is on schedule near Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the tourist town of Medora, with a grand opening planned for July 4, 2026.
In 2019, then-Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill authorizing a $50 million endowment for the library that was contingent on the library foundation raising $100 million in private donations. 
Nathe said inflation and other impacts after the COVID-19 pandemic drove up the cost of multi-year projects like the presidential library.
Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, said he only supported the funding in 2019 because he was told that would be the only request for state dollars to support the presidential library. 
Koppelman, who voted against the new funding, also took issue with the dollars being proposed to the House Appropriations Committee rather than a policy committee.
“We might as well not have policy committees if we’re just going to put policy in budget bills whenever we feel like it,” Koppelman said. “This is a pretty big policy shift to say we’re going to double what we did before after we were told that was it.”

Rep. Jared Hendrix, R-West Fargo, who also voted against the amendment, said he worries that taxpayers would be on the hook to fill funding gaps for the library.
“I think we would be kidding ourselves if we’re going to say that we’re not going to be coming back in the future for many years, and decades, to come to ask for more money because these libraries are not sustainable,” Hendrix said.
The bill also contains a $20 million line of credit from the state-owned Bank of North Dakota for the library to access during the 2025-27 biennium. The goal of the loan is to help fund construction if there are donations pledged that have yet to be received. Lawmakers approved a similar $70 million line of credit for the library in the 2023 session, which the library foundation has not accessed.
“That we haven’t touched our $70 million line of credit with the state shows that we are being responsible about this and trying to raise as much private funds as possible,” said Matt Briney, spokesperson for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation.
To date, the foundation has raised $286 million in private donations for the library project, he said.
“If we get all the private funding for the library, that would essentially be $500 million for the library construction and the endowment contributions,” Briney said.
A $70 million line of credit for the library was included in the state Parks and Recreation budget. However, the latest amendment reduces it to $20 million. Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers intend to only include the loan in one budget.
The bill states that if the loan is not repaid by June 30, 2027, lawmakers would be asked to consider repaying it.
Lawmakers also added a provision that would require admission to the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library to be free for children under 18.
Rep. Vicky Steiner, R-Dickinson, who voted in support of the library funding, said former President Theodore Roosevelt was “larger than life.” She said the library could inspire children for generations.
“This will put us on the map internationally,” Steiner said. She added the library will help tell the story of North Dakota and could influence more investment and people coming to the state.
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library bill aims for federal cost-share, access to artifacts

The House is expected to vote on the overall bill Thursday. The library funding also would need to be considered by the Senate.
The presidential library endowment is managed by the state Department of Trust Lands. The balance was about $54.5 million as of Jan. 31, according to Land Commissioner Joe Heringer.
The presidential library also received $4 million in state funding through the Department of Commerce Destination Development grant program. The funding was designated for recreation trails, paths and pavilions around the library grounds to connect with nearby tourist and recreation sites.
In addition, the library received nearly $500,000 from the state Outdoor Heritage Fund for a native plant seeding project.
There’s also an effort to secure federal funding for up to $50 million for the library. The U.S. Senate passed the legislation last year but the House did not act on it. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., reintroduced the legislation in February, with Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., as a co-sponsor.

(Photo by Danita Delimont/Getty Images)During the Vietnam War, an American officer offered one of the most infamous quotes of all time. Referring to the U.S. military’s decision to bomb into obliteration a town of 35,000 people, he said, “It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.” This quote comes to mind when examining a bill sponsored by Utah Sen. John Curtis, ironically named “Fix Our Forests Act,” S.1462, (FOFA). It should be renamed “We Have to Destroy our Forests to Save Them Act” (WHDFSTA). The bill is forest malpractice, climate malpractice, and public health malpractice.
Sen. Curtis’s S. 1462 is a legislative enactment of Trump’s recent executive order to dramatically ramp up logging on federal lands, exempting 60% of national forest lands from meaningful environmental analysis and public participation under the pretense of a wildfire “emergency.”
Remember Donald Trump is the environmental expert that insists the climate crisis is a hoax, and attributed Western forest fires to insufficient raking of the forest floors. The same expert that in February ordered the emptying of a reservoir critical for Central Valley farms for a photo op pretending that it would send water to fight Los Angeles wildfires. Billions of gallons of agricultural water were squandered, not a drop made it to Los Angeles.
This “WHDFSTA” bill is being justified as emergency wildfire control and a “fuels reduction” imperative, using a complete misrepresentation of what caused the devastating LA County fires in January. Those fires occurred in chaparral and grass lands, not forests. The California Chaparral Institute states that fire suppression efforts have protected chaparral, and not led to an “unnatural” accumulation of vegetation. Moreover, fires spread by 100 mph Santa Ana winds, a natural phenomenon, are not stopped by landscape fuel reduction, thinning, or prescribed fires.
For decades America’s forest management has been conducted for the benefit of the timber, fossil fuel, and ski industries, and Wall Street real estate trusts, rather than to protect the forests themselves, including spending billions to subsidize the timber industry. The bulk of research promoting forest thinning is clouded by conflict of interest. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) treats forests as a commodity. Consider this parallel. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration heavily promoted Prozac, received revenue from Prozac sales, and published research showing its efficacy, the conflict of interest would be obvious. It is a similar conflict of interest with the USFS and the timber and wood products industries.
While trimming around mountain homes helps reduce fire risk, remote, large scale “forest thinning” is a far different matter. For at least 20 years experts have been challenging the efficacy of thinning trees to reduce wildfire spread, and over 40 studies, including from different countries, contradict this conventional wisdom.
The largest relevant study ever done, of over 1,500 fires covering 23 million acres, concluded the more “thinning” of trees in a forest the more quickly and intensely a wildfire burns. One author writes, “Dense, mature forests tend to burn less intensely … because they have higher canopy cover and more shade, which creates a cooler, more moist microclimate. The higher density of trees of all sizes can act as a windbreak, buffering gust-driven flames. Thinning and other activities that remove trees, especially mature trees, reverse those effects, creating hotter, drier, and windier conditions.” Even a USFS review of the largest fire in New Mexico history, a mismanaged prescribed burn, agreed.
Unless thinning is done on an unrealistic, massive scale and frequency, it has little chance of happening at the right time or place to minimize a wildfire. Over a 15-year period wildfire had only a 1-2% chance of even encountering a thinned forest, and leading ecologists have concluded that “fuels reduction cannot alter regional wildfire trends.” The most widely cited forest ecologist in the world, Dr. David Lindenmayer, author of 48 books on forests, says, “logged forests always burn at greater severity than intact forests.”
Curtis’s bill is climate malpractice, and climate is now the primary driver of wildfire risk. Even USFS researchers acknowledge that “wildfire reduction strategies (like forest thinning) reduce carbon sequestration potential in the near term, but provide long term benefit.” That is a scientific contradiction. Climate scientists are adamant that drastically reducing near-term carbon releases is the only thing that will prevent exceeding the threshold for disastrous climate feedback loops.
The bill is public health malpractice. “Prescribed burns,” and burning tens of thousands of slash piles, often part of a thinning strategy, produces massive amounts of deadly air pollution. A new study concluded America’s “prescribed burns” annually cause about 10,000 premature deaths and $100 billion in health costs, about the same as from wildfires.
National forests cover about 15% of the state of Utah. Sen. Curtis’s bill is a huge mistake, further endangering our forests, our health, and our climate future.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-683747825-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 18:09:22.183247

Reflecting on his recent trip to Poland where he says he visited the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz , Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell) asked Marlena Pavlos-Hackney, the owner of a Holland area pizzeria who was arrested in 2021 after she refused to state health orders to enforce masking and social distancing requirements, if as a Polish immigrant if she saw any similarities in history to what she endured under the Michigan state government during the pandemic.
Pavlos-Hackney said there are “absolutely” similarities, but it would take more time than the hour and half meeting of the Michigan state House Subcommittee for Weaponization of State Government on Wednesday to fully encapsulate the experience of living under communism in Poland up until 1983 when she emigrated.
“Yes, that’s why I’m fighting for our god-given unalienable rights, constitutional protected rights that we the people have and I will do whatever it takes to fight… this is the greatest country in the whole world… thank God we have [a legislature] like you who stand up and protect us and try to do what is right for ‘we the people’,” Pavlos-Hackney said.

More than 40,000 people in Michigan have died due to COVID-19 since the first case was found in the state in March of 2020, part of the more than 1 million deaths from the virus recorded in the United States.
Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a slew of executive orders during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 until the state Supreme Court ruled that Whitmer did not have the constitutional authority to continue to extend her restrictions. However, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, used its authority to institute its own emergency orders limiting large gatherings and requiring social distancing and mandating masks.
The COVID era in Michigan did immeasurable damage to the state, according to committee chair, Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Alto), who noted economic ruin for Michigan businesses, learning loss in students from school shutdowns and the negative social impact isolation had on residents. And after five years, Rigas added the infringement on the freedoms of residents and business owners by the governor and state agencies cannot be forgotten.
“I’d like to see legislation introduced to rein in the power of these departments. They are not elected, and they have gotten more power than our executive branch, than our legislative branch and it’s time that we bring it in, rein it in, and put these departments where they belong, and restore freedom for Michigan and put government back in its place,” Rigas said.
Increasing oversight in government is why Rigas said she ran for office, having been amongst the several barbers and professional stylists who received citations at an event at the Michigan state Capitol in May 2020 called “Operation Haircut” in protest of emergency orders for social distancing. The criminal charges were eventually dropped after the state Supreme Court’s decision that Whitmer’s executive orders were unconstitutional.
The event was largely in solidarity with Karl Manke who kept his barbershop in Owosso open despite Whitmer’s COVID-19 restrictions. Manke faced a criminal case related to his refusals to comply with COVID orders, but it was dismissed after the state Supreme Court’s decision on Whitmer’s orders.
Manke said he had to get back to work after closing his doors for a few weeks to comply with the COVID orders, but it didn’t take him long to realize that what the governor was doing was wrong.
“I’ve been accused, oftentimes, of being a little bit, maybe a little bit over the top… I don’t mind being called some type of a rascal, but to walk that path of a coward was something I just could not do. I couldn’t see myself operating that way, as a coward, not standing up for what I believe,” Manke said.

During the pandemic Michiganders across the state made sacrifices for the health and safety of their loved ones and community members, prioritizing the lives of others over self interests, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement ahead of the committee meeting. However, Hackney and Manke deliberately and repeatedly violated policies enacted for public safety.
“At a time of great fear and uncertainty when Michiganders across the State were making difficult sacrifices to protect the public health and the lives of loved ones, these two would sacrifice nothing, refused to implement any health or safety protocols, and in their total disregard for their communities’ safety amidst a deadly global pandemic, represented the worst of us,” Nessel said.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A panel of North Carolina judges struck down a new Republican-led law Wednesday that sought to move control of the state’s elections board under the control of the GOP state auditor — siding with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein and declaring the law unconstitutional.
Senate Bill 382, passed late last year, shifted a number of aspects of executive branch power within the state away from the incoming governor. Among those changes were steering control of the elections board — which is currently overseen by the governor and has a Democratic majority — to newly elected auditor Dave Boliek, a Republican.
Citing a series of prior rulings on executive power and elections board control, the Wake County Superior Court judges wrote that the law was unconstitutional and should be permanently enjoined.
“Because the duty to faithfully execute the laws has been exclusively assigned to the governor, Senate Bill 382 cannot reassign that duty to the auditor without violating the constitution,” wrote Judges Edwin G. Wilson, Jr., a Democrat,  and Lori I. Hamilton, a Republican.
Judge R. Andrew Womble, a Republican, dissented from the pair’s ruling, writing that the legislature was “expressly authorized” to shift duties to the auditor.
In a statement Wednesday, Stein celebrated the ruling that declared “the legislature’s power grab unconstitutional.”
“The North Carolina Constitution puts the governor in charge of executing the law,” Stein said. “That’s what the voters elected me to do, so that’s what I’ll do.”
Boliek said he would appeal the ruling.
“My office remains ready, willing, and able to take on the duties and responsibilities of overseeing board of elections appointments and budget administration,” he said in a statement. “I stand by my arguments and will promptly be appealing this ruling.”
Stein has filed separate suits challenging other portions of the law, dealing with control of the state Highway Patrol and his power to make court appointments.
A spokesperson for the Board of Elections told NC Newsline in November 2024 that if the law were to take effect, it would likely result in control of the board changing hands, with a 3-2 Republican split.
The offices of Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) and House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling Wednesday.

Jan. 28, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Senators and school administrators expressed hesitation Wednesday in lowering, back to age 55, the minimum retirement age at which Nebraska school employees can step down with full benefits.
Currently, eligible school employees face what is known as the “Rule of 85,” whereby if someone’s age plus years of service exceeds 85, that person can retire without any reductions in benefits. Employees who started before July 2018 can retire as young as 55, but employees hired after have to wait until at least age 60.
Tim Royers, president of the NSEA, said an amendment to reverse that “poor decision” would have little financial or staffing impact and could incentivize young educators to look ahead to retirement.
“Our young educators deserve the same flexibility that I and other veteran teachers enjoy when it comes to deciding when we turn off the classroom lights for the last time,” Royers said at a Wednesday hearing on the proposed amendment, which he supported.
The Nebraska Council of School Administrators and the Nebraska Association of School Boards opposed the change.
Lawmakers advance changes to Nebraska school retirement plan to help close budget hole

Royers said it would be in the best interest of a teacher who, at age 55, already has 30 years of service, to step back if they’re exhausted rather than being forced to work five more years.
State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, chair of the Legislature’s Nebraska Retirement Systems Committee, proposed the change as a deal with the NSEA. In return, the State of Nebraska would agree to withhold annual contributions to the school retirement plan for the next two years before going to a stair-stepped contribution system based on the plan’s funding level.
The amendment comes to Legislative Bill 645, which was introduced by Ballard on behalf of Gov. Jim Pillen and seeks to change the annual contribution levels for the state, employees and school districts. 
  State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, left, talks with State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth. June 1, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The school retirement plan for employees statewide outside of Omaha Public Schools (who have a separate pension plan) is currently 99.91% funded.
If passed, the current version of LB 645 is expected to save the state about $80 million. With the new amendment, the state would save approximately $20 million more.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who has consistently opposed a shaky negotiations process behind LB 645, has repeatedly asked why the school plan had to be changed now.
Royers said the original LB 645, which would have offered no reduced contributions to school employees or employers, was a “poor bill” that he said was brought for the wrong reasons, mainly to help plug the state’s nearly half-a-billion-dollar projected budget deficit.
However, Royers said it presented a rare chance to “force” a conversation on the plan, leading to an amended bill that could give the average school teacher more than $1,000 in annual take-home pay because of reduced contributions. Now, he views the amended bill as a way to give hard-working employees a benefit and put them on a more “equal playing field.”
Royers said he has to look for any wins for educators in a political environment where he said the “political will” makes such victories “candidly, limited.”

Conrad asked Royers what happens if he is wrong about the feasibility of the amended bill, to which Royers responded that he hopes he’s not. He pointed to an actuarial study showing that the amended LB 645 and a lower Rule of 85 could be financially feasible.
Tim Hruza, appearing on behalf of the school administrators association, said the organization wanted a new actuarial study to fully understand the impact of a modified Rule of 85. 
But if the changes have to wait another year, Royers said he’s OK with that.
“If the end result of this is we’ve had this conversation, it’s on the radar but it’s not going to be something we get to until next year,” Royers said, “I’m perfectly fine with that.”
LB 645 will return for the second of three stages of debate on Thursday. Ballard said he is likely to withdraw the amendment that was considered Wednesday. The full state budget will need to advance from the Appropriations Committee by next Tuesday, with debate beginning May 6.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House agreed Wednesday to restrict public access to security-related information from the Iowa Capitol building, a Senate-approved measure added to a bill raising penalties and training requirements for Iowa’s open meetings and records laws.
House File 706 passed 83-10 and goes next to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The House had passed the bill unanimously in March.
Most of the legislation deals with Iowa’s open meetings laws. It sets fines for open meetings law violations between $500 and $2,500. Under current law, fines are between $100 and $500. The fine for knowing violation of these laws would be $5,000 to $12,500, up from range in current law of $1,000-$2,500.
A court would also remove a member of a government body from office for violating open meetings laws if they had engaged in a prior violation of the laws, removing a current provision stating removal will only happen if damages from the previous violation were assessed against the person during their term.
The bill also requires newly elected and appointed public officials complete training on open records laws.
These components, which received bipartisan approval in the House, were not changed by the amendment. The Senate amendment, led by Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, adds two types of information to the list in current law of confidential records related to security information on state-owned or leased property. Security camera footage operated by the legislative branch and information from state employee identification card access systems would be confidential  under the bill.
Webster said these restrictions are needed to improve security at the Statehouse, saying Capitol security footage can currently be used to identify “blind spots” in security or to stalk and harass government employees and elected officials. Legislative staff said there have been no reports of people using security camera footage to stalk or harass any individuals at the Iowa Capitol.
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, said he was opposed to the amendment as badge swipes of lawmakers are already not subject to release by open records requests, and he believed there were valid reasons why the public should have access to Capitol security camera footage. While concerns about stalking and threats were valid, Wilburn said, there may be situations where members of the public or the media should have access to this video footage during events like protests.
Rep. Ken Croken, D-Davenport, called for the Legislature to be “as open as we request others to be at all times.”
“I think it’s objectionable and not a good look for this body to operate on a ‘rules for thee but not for me’ M.O.,” Croken said.
Rep. Jennifer Smith, R-Dubuque, said “what is important with this is the original bill” — the higher penalties and training requirements for open meetings laws. The bill was prompted by alleged open meetings and open records laws violations by the City of Davenport in 2023, related to both an apartment building collapse and settlement agreements with city employees.

Public agencies, their contractors, and companies with more than 25 employees are now required to use E-Verify, but companies with fewer than 25 employees would also have to use the system under HB 955 from Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques.
House lawmakers approved the change, 88-25, with seven Democrats joining every Republican in supporting the bill.
However, it’s unlikely that the proposal will make it to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk because the Senate didn’t take up in any of its committees other proposals to expand the E-Verify requirement. That’s despite the fact that the proposal enjoyed bipartisan support in the Legislature’s upper chamber, with bills that would require all businesses in Florida to use E-Verify filed by South Florida Democrat Jason Pizzo (SB 782) and Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia (SB 1498).
The Florida Legislature passed a bill in 2021 requiring all public employers, contractors, and subcontractors to use E-Verify. They followed that up with a measure two years ago requiring that only private companies with more than 25 employees have to use the system.
More than 441,000 Florida companies have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2023 report from the Office of Advocacy at the U.S. Small Business Administration.
‘Politically motivated’
Florida law now allows businesses with fewer than 25 employees the option of using E-Verify or the federal form I-9 issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. North Miami-Dade County Rep. Dotie Joseph noted that provision in arguing against the proposal, saying that nothing stops Florida businesses from choosing to use E-Verify right now.
“If they choose to use I-9, let them,” she said. “If they choose to use E-Verify, let them. But most businesses just say no to E-Verify. You know why? Because it sucks.”
She called the bill a “politically motivated anti-immigrant attack that hurts Florida businesses and hard-working people who are looking to hire and work legally in this country.”
Orlando Democrat Anna Eskamani said of the proposal, “We’re basically taking a population of hard-working people and rejecting them, purely based on what the federal government defines as an unregulated status. And I think that’s dangerous, bad for economy, [and] does not make any one of us more safe.”
Duval County Republican Kiyan Michael co-sponsored the measure. She lost her son Brandon to a 2007 auto accident blamed on an undocumented immigrant who’d already been deported twice and who was driving without a license.
“Those who are voting down on this bill, who did you take an oath to?” she asked, looking at the Democrats on the other side the House chamber. “I’m sure it was not for people who were not able to vote for you, and who did not vote for you.”

Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.
Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices, but the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”
 Recovered at crime scenes

The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.

The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.

Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department. The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”
 Alabama and New Mexico

Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Democratic state Rep. Phil Ensler, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.












This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– Democratic Alabama state Rep. Phil Ensler




According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.
New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.
“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.
 Lawsuits against Glock

Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

Photos by Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia Commons and Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont Attorney General Charity Clark is joining the top prosecutors of 11 other states in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, the Attorney General’s office announced Wednesday.The attorneys general, who filed the lawsuit Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York City, argue that Trump’s four executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from other countries violate Article I of the U.S. Constitution, which assigns Congress, not the president, the “Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”“President Trump’s illegal tariffs will harm Vermont’s businesses and consumers,” Clark said in a Wednesday press release announcing the suit. “I’m suing the Trump Administration for the tenth time over these illegal tariffs to protect working Vermonters, small businesses, and our economy.”The lawsuit requests a preliminary and permanent injunction blocking U.S. Customs and Border Patrol from enforcing the tariffs. Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly invoked the International Economic Emergency Powers Act while issuing a flurry of executive orders unilaterally declaring levies on imported goods.But the lawsuit argues that the 1970’s-era law doesn’t grant the president the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under any circumstances. Moreover, the attorneys general argue in the suit, Trump has trotted out the once-obscure law under false pretenses, claiming that the tariffs are aimed at countering various alleged national security threats, such as illegal immigration and cross-border fentanyl smuggling.“Yet over the last three months, the President has imposed, modified, escalated, and suspended tariffs by executive order, memoranda, social media post, and agency decree,” the lawsuit states. “These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the President’s whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority.”The lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal challenges made to the Trump Administration’s tariff policy in recent weeks.Earlier this month, California filed a lawsuit similarly questioning the constitutionality of Trump’s trade-related executive orders. Members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana and two non-profits — the New Civil Liberties Alliance and the Liberty Justice Center —  have also all filed lawsuits opposing various aspects of the administration’s tariff policy in recent weeks.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont, 11 other states sue Trump Administration over tariff policies.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Donald-Trump-Charity-Clark.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Many young Americans and New Mexicans feel anger toward the political system and increasingly left behind and frustrated by both major political parties, says James Hernandez, president of University of New Mexico College Democrats.
As more young people in New Mexico identify as independents and feel neither the Democratic or Republican parties represent their views, ensuring all New Mexicans, regardless of their political affiliation, can participate in state primary elections becomes even more important, Hernandez said
“Whether you are a college student deciding to become an independent who doesn’t want to register with the major political party, whether you are an independent New Mexican that is fed up with the political system, you have a right to participate in our state primary elections,” he said.
A newly enacted state law, Senate Bill 16, ensures that right, Hernandez told a small group of advocates and election officials who gathered outside the state capitol on Wednesday to celebrate its enactment earlier this month. Over the next year, they say they’ll be educating the public about the change.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on April 7 signed SB16 into law, following nearly seven years of public education and legislative outreach, said Sila Avcil, executive director of New Mexico Open Elections and New Mexico Voters First. In the past three years, she said, more than 20 local organizations joined the effort to pass it.
Currently, independents — or non-affiliated voters — can use same-day registration at the polls for primary elections, register with one of the major parties, and then vote in that primary election. Even that option has only been available since 2022, following a 2020 law change. Now independents won’t have to do that to participate.
“They simply decide, ‘I want a Republican ballot, or I want a Democratic ballot,’ while keeping their unaffiliated status or decline-to-state status,” Hernandez said.
Ultimately, Avcil said the new law allows more than 330,000 registered voters unaffiliated with parties to participate, and makes New Mexico the second state in U.S. history to enact semi-open primaries, in which independent voters can participate in the primary of their choice, while voters registered with a major party can only vote in their party’s primary.
Bernalillo County Clerk Michelle Kavanaugh said of the 424,000 registered voters in her county, over 100,000 of those “have been shut out of part of the decision-making process.”
The old law created unnecessary barriers for voters, additional work for poll workers and administrative strain for county clerks and the Secretary of State, Avcil said.
“That’s not just policy, it’s progress, and it speaks volumes about what’s possible when we come together and fight for a fairer and more inclusive democracy,” she said.
Rep. Christina Parajón (D-Albuquerque), who co-sponsored SB16 and carried it in the House of Representatives, said the new law marks a historic step for young people’s and veterans’ right to vote.
Parajón said the advocates who helped enact it have been committed to it because American democracy is an ongoing project.
“This is not just about parties, it’s about rights and increasing voter participation,” Parajón said. “Our dream is that with a bill like this, we lead the nation in voter participation, in young people voter participation and in veteran voter participation. We dream that in our multicultural state, all voices can be heard.”
Kavanaugh said more fights remain to keep elections open. For example, in neighboring Arizona, Republican lawmakers are considering a proposal that would force voters to cast their ballots at neighborhood voting sites capped at 1,000 registered voters apiece, rather than more flexible voting centers.
New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver said she used to oppose the idea of open primaries, but changed her mind because when she worked as the Bernalillo County Clerk, she saw her staff and poll workers turn people away from the polls.
“With more participation, we get better electoral outcomes,” Toulouse Oliver said. “We get elected officials that look like us, feel like us, have values like us. It’s a very challenging time in our country, and having this bill pass, to celebrate this and show that our state is moving forward, and we’re going to have an incredibly participative primary in 2026, is very exciting news that we all need.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Proposed rules that would require schools to collect Oklahoma students’ immigration status and mandate that teachers pass the U.S. Naturalization Test face bipartisan opposition in the state House.
Republicans and Democrats on the House Administrative Rules Committee expressed concerns with the proposals from the Oklahoma State Department of Education during a meeting Wednesday.
The immigration rule, which drew outcry from Gov. Kevin Stitt and many Oklahomans, could overstep the state agency’s authority, committee members of both political parties said.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education approved the rule on Jan. 28, sending it to the state Legislature for review. 
The proposed rule would require schools to ask families to provide proof of citizenship or legal residency during enrollment. Schools would have to report to the state the number of children they enroll whose families were unable to provide this documentation.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters said he proposed the idea to better account for the resources needed in schools to accommodate immigrant students, like English learner programs. He said the state Department of Education would turn over the information to federal authorities, if asked, and would support immigration raids in schools.
Alabama enacted a similar law in 2011 for citizenship checks in schools, but a federal lawsuit later overturned the policy. Federal regulations forbid schools from asking students for their immigration status. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that undocumented children cannot be denied access to public education.

House committee members Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, and Rep. Clay Staires, R-Skiatook, both recommended a rejection of the immigration rule. Waldron said it could put an undue burden on schools, families and the state’s workforce and isn’t authorized by state law.
“I feel that if we allow this rule to come forward, we’re just going to replicate Alabama’s constitutional path, spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawsuits and end up back in the same place,” Waldron said during the meeting.
An administrative rule from a state agency isn’t an appropriate method of implementing citizenship checks in schools, Staires said. The state Legislature and the governor should have to approve legislation to create such a policy, he said.
The committee’s leader, Rep. Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, said he and his Senate counterpart, Sen. Micheal Bergstron, R-Adair, will review whether the rule has the proper basis in state law. He said some members of the House panel support the rule while others oppose it.
Over the coming week, the House and Senate will develop six resolutions that could approve and disapprove various state agency rules, including the Education Department’s, Kendrix said. If both chambers pass the resolutions, they would continue to the governor, who has pledged to block the immigration rule.
Stitt has been a vocal opponent of collecting children’s immigration information. He replaced three members of the state Board of Education who voted in favor of the proposed rule.
“I don’t think that President (Donald) Trump’s policies are talking about going after kids,” Stitt said during a news conference Wednesday. “He’s talking about criminals. He’s talking about criminal activity. He’s talking about getting those folks out of our country, secure our border, knowing who’s coming in. We agree with all that. I’m not going to start picking on 7, 8 year olds and putting them on a list.”
Kendrix said he’s mindful of the governor’s statements, as well as the voices of other Oklahomans who have spoken out against the rule, but it doesn’t change the committee’s approach.

“I respect the governor,” Kendrix said after the committee meeting. “I respect the governor’s opinion. He’s a part of this process. It’s a way our government is set up, and I respect that. But I also know that our responsibility is to take these rules, look at the statutes, look at the intent, look at the process and make the decision based on that.”
Another of Walters’ proposed rules also drew bipartisan concerns — one that would require all public school teachers to pass the U.S. Naturalization Test. Educators would have to take a written version of the citizenship test to earn or renew their teacher certification.
One of the committee members, Rep. Michelle McCane, D-Tulsa, was a teacher until she took office in November. She said the measure is a “slap in the face” to educators and could turn teachers away from the profession, which already has a critical workforce shortage.
Rep. Marilyn Stark, R-Bethany, said she spoke with experienced teachers who were against the test becoming part of renewing their certification. 
“I, too, think that to require career teachers to go back to a test like this for recertification is a bit of overreach,” Stark told the committee. “It could be put into statute for incoming teachers initially, but I’ve had career teachers reach out to me that said they’re very good teachers, that said they would not do this and they would not renew.”

Waldron and Staires both suggested the committee reject a rule that would require schools to report to the Education Department’s Awareity system if a teacher resigns while under suspicion of child abuse or neglect. Awareity is a platform for reporting complaints to the state agency.
Waldron said he isn’t in favor of creating a rule reliant on a third-party vendor. Although not opposed to the idea, Staires said he also recommended disapproval because the regulation should come from legislation, not the administrative rulemaking process. 
Kendrix said during the meeting that he questioned whether the rule is rooted in the necessary statutory authority. Administrative rules are meant to expound upon existing law.
Where Republicans and Democrats disagreed was over a rule impacting school counselors. The Education Department proposed a requirement that 80% of counselors’ total work time is spent on counseling services.
On top of providing mental health and career readiness support to students, counselors also are involved in administering state tests and other tasks.
The Oklahoma School Counselor Association has endorsed the 80% rule.
Waldron said it could infringe on school leaders’ local control and flexibility. Staires said the measure could protect counselors’ time. Both lawmakers are former educators.
“I don’t see this as a restriction,” Staires said during the meeting. “I see this as a protection. We want our counselors to be able to do what we hire them to do.”

The latest of those machinations came on Tuesday when President Donald Trump endorsed Montana Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines on Truth Social.
“Steve Daines is a Great Man, and TREMENDOUS Senator, representing the Fantastic People of Montana. I love Montana, won every one of my Races there by a landslide, and would only recommend the best to represent you in the Senate!” the president wrote.
“Senator Steve Daines, of the Great State of Montana, has my Complete and Total Endorsement — HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
Daines is Montana’s senior senator, following the election of Republican Tim Sheehy last November. Since 2023 he has served as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), helping elect Republicans nationwide, including elevating Sheehy to victory over former Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.
After first winning his seat in Congress in 2014 with 57.8% of the vote, Daines ran for re-election in 2020, facing termed-out Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock. Daines defeated Bullock with 55.01% of the vote that year.
While Daines has not yet officially announced his re-election, he thanked Trump for his endorsement on X, formerly Twitter, and is actively fundraising based on Federal Election Commission filings. Currently, FEC filings for the Steve Daines for Montana committee show he has $2.4 million in cash on hand, with nearly $1 million in contributions during the first quarter of the year.
Montana used to be considered a purple state with Democrats serving in statewide elected offices for more than a century until the 2024 election. President Trump carried the state in all three of his elections, winning with increasingly high margins of 56.17%, 56.92%, and 58.39%.
Trump visited Montana in 2024 to campaign for Sheehy, drawing thousands of people to a rally in Bozeman.
Currently there are no clear frontrunners from the Democratic party to challenge Daines’ re-election.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Federal regulators approved limits on the maximum and minimum prices that electricity generators are paid to ensure an adequate energy supply as part of a settlement between Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration and the region’s electrical grid operator.
In a unanimous decision Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a cap on prices that Shapiro claims will save consumers about $21 billion on electricity bills over the next two years.
The decision came as the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission is set to hold a hearing Thursday in Harrisburg where it will hear testimony on the impact of artificial intelligence and projects such as Amazon Web Services’ plan to build a massive data center in northeast Pennsylvania. 
Fueled by increased electrification of transportation, heating and industry combined with the proliferation of electricity intensive data centers, demand for electricity has surged in recent years. Meanwhile, the ability of electricity generators to connect new sources of power to the grid has been stalled by a failing review process as the number of applications has surged.
PJM Interconnection, which operates the electricity grid for Pennsylvania and all or part of 12 other states, holds auctions every year in which electricity generators bid to supply electricity capacity during demand spikes, such as during severe weather and other grid emergencies.
The auction last year (for 2025-2026 capacity) produced a price of nearly $270 per megawatt day for much of the footprint (with some areas spiking much higher) compared to nearly $29 per megawatt day during the last auction.
Under the price limits FERC approved Monday for 2026-2027 and 2027-2028, PJM will reduce the maximum auction price from $500 per megawatt-day to $325 per megawatt-day and set the minimum price at $175 per megawatt-day. A megawatt-day is roughly enough electricity to power 400 to 900 homes for 24 hours, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
That means that although consumers will see energy prices increase up to 20% for some utilities this summer, the price limits will avert what the Shapiro administration predicted would have been a runaway auction price that could have tripled energy costs.
“My Administration worked with FERC and PJM to find a path forward that will save Pennsylvanians billions of dollars on their electricity bills. I will continue to work to ensure safe, reliable, and affordable power for Pennsylvanians for the long term,” Shapiro said in a statement.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7706-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 18:09:22.183247

(Andrew Harnik | Getty Images)The Trump administration announced plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply before the end of next year.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey appeared on stage alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the announcement Tuesday in Washington, D.C. It’s not yet clear how the food and beverage industries will handle the changes, but supporters say healthier alternatives — like beet and carrot juices — can be used to dye food. 
Morrisey recently signed legislation banning a list of colorful artificial food dyes in West Virginia school meals this year. The bill also banned artificial dyes in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning in 2028. 
“People are going to be hearing a lot more about getting the crap out of the food,” Morrisey told WSAZ. “This builds in with the other health care related initiatives that I’ve put forth in the Mountain State to make sure that we’re incentivizing the consumption of healthy foods…”
While other states have banned certain dyes, West Virginia’s legislation, spearheaded by a group of Republican lawmakers, is the first sweeping food dye ban to be signed into law.
Sen. Jason Barrett, R-Berkeley, who championed the bill, also attended Kennedy’s announcement in D.C. 
“There’s a lot of folks that came up to us that are in the [Make America Healthy Again] movement and really indicated their opinion was that because West Virginia took the action that they did, it has forced the large food and beverage manufacturers to come to the table with Secretary Kennedy to develop a plan [to] get these harmful food dyes out of our food,” Barrett said.
The federal Department of Health and Human Services said it aims to work with the food industry to eliminate six synthetic dyes — such as red dye No. 40 and blue No. 1 — from the food and drink supply. 
The FDA has approved 36 food dyes, nine of which are artificial and made from petroleum. The Biden administration previously announced that the federal government would ban Red No. 3 in food beginning in 2027.
The synthetic dyes are used to give foods like Skittles and Cheetos their vibrant hues. 
“These poisonous compounds offer no nutritional benefit and pose real, measurable dangers to our children’s health and development. That era is coming to an end,” Kennedy said in a statement. 
Kennedy and some West Virginia lawmakers have linked the synthetic dyes to health problems and behavioral issues in children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration hasn’t established that artificial dyes cause behavioral problems, but those in support of the ban have listed studies showing that they do. 
The FDA also announced measures aimed at phasing out the dyes, including establishing a timeline for the food industry to transition from the synthetic dyes to natural alternatives.
“I will give the FDA credit in that they have announced there have been several other natural food dyes that are getting approval that will provide more options,” Barrett said.
The Trump administration hasn’t received guarantees or written agreement from food companies regarding the artificial dye mandate. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary hopes the food industry will make the changes voluntarily.
“There are a number of tools at our disposal. And so I believe in love, and let’s start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes,” Makary said. “They want to do it.”
As West Virginia lawmakers worked on their food dye ban legislation, the state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure, warning it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said. 
Lawmakers dismissed that idea, saying it was industry “scare tactics.” 
The HHS also announced that the FDA will partner with the NIH Nutrition Regulatory Science and Research Program to enhance nutrition and food-related research to better inform regulatory decisions.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota won special terms for itself and financial concessions for universities across the country while settling a lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association, according to a Wednesday announcement from state Attorney General Marty Jackley.
The NCAA is the governing body for the highest level of college athletics. Jackley and the South Dakota Board of Regents sued the NCAA last year. The lawsuit alleged that a proposed $2.8 billion nationwide agreement to compensate athletes for their past participation in Division I sports would disproportionately burden smaller Division I schools, including South Dakota State University and the University of South Dakota.
Jackley said Wednesday in a news release that the NCAA will use a budget surplus of $55 million to reduce the amount of money that athletic conferences will have to pay toward the proposed athlete compensation agreement. The reduction will occur during the first year of the proposed decade of payments from conferences.
South Dakota Board of Regents sues NCAA over proposed athlete pay settlement

The NCAA, in a separate news release, said the surplus is available because “the national office surpassed financial goals for the fiscal year.” The NCAA’s release does not mention South Dakota’s lawsuit but says the decision to reduce the financial burden on member schools was made “in consultation with South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley.”
A copy of the settlement terms, provided by the Attorney General’s Office, shows that the NCAA agreed to credit Jackley “for his efforts in giving small schools and conferences relief.”
Jackley said the settlement reduces by 33% the amount that universities will pay toward the first year of the proposed $2.8 billion athlete compensation agreement, saving approximately $2 million for the Summit League and the Missouri Valley Conference, which include the two South Dakota schools.
“This settlement is for and about our student athletes,” Jackley said in his release.
The settlement also “provides the attorney general an opportunity to work with the NCAA on future reductions and stipulates that funding of the newly created Women’s Basketball Performance Fund remain intact with no reductions,” Jackley’s news release said. The performance fund, created in January, rewards teams that advance to the Division I Women’s Basketball Championship, similar to a previously existing arrangement for men’s teams.
In South Dakota-specific provisions, the settlement commits the NCAA president and select staff to meet with the presidents of SDSU, USD, the Summit League and Sioux Falls leaders to discuss “NCAA issues currently impacting state schools and opportunities to host future NCAA championships in the state.” During that meeting, the settlement terms say, the NCAA president “will acknowledge and credit the Summit League for the large attendance numbers the League has generated at the men’s and women’s basketball championships as a result of hosting the events in South Dakota.”
The NCAA also agreed to pay the South Dakota Board of Regents $24,815 to reimburse it for expenses incurred during the litigation.
The broader issue underlying the litigation is a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the NCAA’s prohibition on athlete compensation was a violation of antitrust laws. That led to a proposed $2.8 billion agreement last year to settle several class action lawsuits against the NCAA. In that litigation, athletes sued to recover back payment for their participation in college athletics. A federal judge in California is deciding whether to give final approval to the $2.8 billion agreement, known as the House v. NCAA settlement.



Settlement terms
The NCAA agreed to the following terms in its settlement with South Dakota, according to the text of communications provided by the state Attorney General’s Office:



The NCAA will credit the South Dakota Attorney General for his efforts in giving small schools and conferences relief when it announces the DI Board of Directors’ decision to reduce the amount of revenue withheld from all Division I conferences needed to make the first of the ten annual payments to settle the House litigation. NCAA will make this public announcement the week of April 21. 
The NCAA will meet with the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office to explore possible ways to minimize the impact on the State arising from the NCAA’s future withholding of revenue to pay for the House settlement.
The NCAA President and select staff will meet in-person with the presidents of SDSU and USD, the Summit League, and other Sioux Falls leaders within the next twelve (12) months to discuss NCAA issues currently impacting State schools and opportunities to host future NCAA championships in the State. During the meeting, the NCAA President will acknowledge and credit the Summit League for the large attendance numbers the League has generated at the men’s and women’s basketball championships as a result of hosting the events in South Dakota. 
Within thirty (30) days of dismissal of the Lawsuit, the NCAA will make a one-time payment to the South Dakota Board of Regents in the amount of $24,815 to reimburse expenses incurred by experts.

Nearly 200 people came to discuss concerns about President Trump's executive orders and cuts to federal agencies. The two states attorneys general are among 23 Democratic attorneys general nationwide who have sued the federal government more than a dozen times in the first three months of Trump's second term. (Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)This is a developing story and will be updated.
Oregon is leading 11 other states in suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the U.S.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed Wednesday by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
Rayfield plans to discuss the suit with reporters later this afternoon.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont as well as Oregon— are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China; a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico; and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Attorney General’s Office.
“When a president pushes an unlawful policy that drives up prices at the grocery store and spikes utility bills, we don’t have the luxury of standing by — especially when so many Oregonians live on fixed incomes,” Rayfield said in the news release.
Rayfield and the attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the Executive Branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University
Feeling the pain
Both Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small and medium business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky’s senior U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as next week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

“The American people will pay more at the checkout line because of these unlawful tariffs imposed by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in announcing the state’s participation in the lawsuit. “We were promised that prices would go down—but instead, these tariffs are driving up the cost of everyday goods for families across the country. Without a legitimate state of emergency, the President does not have the authority to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs that hurt working Americans. Our communities should not have to shoulder the burden of bad policy decisions, and I will see this lawsuit through to ensure the American people are protected from unnecessary and unjustified financial strain.”

(Photo via Getty Images)A bill that would provide tax credits for the purchase and installation of radon mitigation systems and require passive mitigation in new construction, advanced Wednesday from the House floor. 
Lawmakers said the bill was an “easy” vote to protect Iowans from the second leading cause of lung cancer. 
Radon, which is a radioactive gas emitted by the natural breakdown of soil and rock, seeps into houses through cracks in the foundation, or other openings. More than 70% of Iowa homes are above the recommended levels of radon set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which puts Iowa on the list of states with the highest radon exposure rates. 
Rep. Hans Wilz, a Republican from Ottumwa and the bill’s floor manager, called it “common sense policy” to address the rising cancer rates in Iowa.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Cancer prevention is just as important as cancer research and medical treatment,” Wilz said, “We need to act and attack cancer in every way to ensure Iowa cancer rates go down.” 
According to the Iowa Cancer Consortium, lung cancer from radon exposure causes 400 deaths annually in Iowa.
Wilz introduced an amendment to the bill that would require new single-family and two-family homes to install passive radon mitigation systems during construction. The amendment was akin to a bill passed by the House last year, which did not see debate in the Senate. 
The amendment was approved by the House. 
House File 1027 also would create an individual and corporate income tax credit, up to $1,000, for the purchase and installation of an indoor radon mitigation system. It would apply to tax years on or after Jan. 1, 2025. 
Wilz said for every dollar invested in radon mitigation, the state can expect to see $20-$40 saved in avoided health care costs. 
“Radon is a silent killer, but it’s one we can defeat,” Wilz said. “By testing our homes, installing mitigation systems as needed, we can protect our families, we can make Iowa healthier.” 
The bill defines radon mitigation as systems “designed to reduce radon concentrations in the indoor air of a building.”
Another radon-related bill, House File 707, would create a standing appropriation for the Department of Health and Human Services to make radon testing kits free to homeowners and renters in the state. The bill has not had any hearings in the appropriations committee thus far. 
Wilz said a 2022 law that requires radon testing and mitigation in Iowa schools shows that Iowa is taking “great steps forward” to address the risks of radon. 
“No Iowan should lose their life to a preventable threat like radon,” Wilz said. 
The bill was approved 92-1 and advanced to the Senate, as amended.

SPRINGFIELD — Protesters flooded the rotunda of the Illinois Statehouse earlier this month, urging legislators to increase wages for caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The ‘They Deserve More’ coalition — representing advocacy organizations, families and over 90 agencies providing community care — is asking that these direct support personnel, or DSPs, receive at least 150% of Illinois’ minimum wage.

The coalition is also seeking to avoid a cut to state-funded DSP service hours that would result from a provision in Gov. JB Pritzker’s proposed budget for the Illinois Department of Human Services.

In 2021, Illinois ranked 46th in a University of Kansas study of states’ spending on intellectual and developmental disabilities services, though in recent years the state has increased funding, including a $2.50 hourly increase for DSPs in fiscal year 2024. The proposal is one of dozens of budget requests that lawmakers will consider as they work to finalize a spending plan by the end of the May session amid federal funding uncertainties.

Wages

Demonstrators called for support for two bills moving through the Illinois General Assembly, House Bill 2788 and Senate Bill 1690, which propose raising the base wage for DSPs. Both bills failed to clear the legislature ahead of recent deadlines, but matters pertaining to state funding are generally included in the end-of-session budget package.

Edwina Hernandez, a DSP Recruiter at Cornerstone Services in Joliet, says her agency has trouble providing services to disabled residents due to employee retention challenges. DSPs are the individuals who provide daily personal care such as assisting individuals with eating, grooming and dressing.

“We do have a lot of workers out there who have a heart to serve and a heart to help the community. It’s just the pay,” Hernandez said at the demonstration.

DSPs are vital to the wellbeing of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their ability to lead happy and meaningful lives, according to the coalition. The work can be physically demanding and emotionally difficult.

Family members and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities also attended the protest, expressing appreciation for the DSPs in their lives.

“We don’t give enough importance in our society to people who take care of other people, and the human touch is very important,” said Lena Grant, whose brother, Michael Jordan, has lived at Cornerstone for the past 20 years. “Our relatives and our loved ones are the most important things in our lives, so the people that take care of them deserve the utmost pay for their work, their effort, their education.”

The proposed budget for IDHS includes a 50-cent hourly increase that would bring the base wage to $21 an hour statewide, approximately 140% of the minimum wage in Illinois. Advocates say this raise is important for rewarding the work of caring for Illinoisians who cannot care for themselves.

House sponsor Rep. Laura Faver Dias, D-Grayslake, said the proposed increase falls short of the state’s 150% target. The target comes from a study prepared by Guidehouse Inc. for IDHS with the intention of bringing the state in line with the Ligas Consent Decree.

The consent decree requires Illinois to provide certain care options to qualifying Illinoisians who request them. Reaching the 150% goal would require current DSP base wages to increase by $2 per hour.

Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mohamet, a co-sponsor of the Senate bill, agreed the proposal falls short.

“For providers who hire someone who’s going to feed, bathe, clothe one of our developmentally disabled friends and neighbors, you can make more money at McDonald’s,” Rose said in an interview with the Medill Illinois News Bureau for Capitol News Illinois.

Service Hours

The proposed budget would add more money to pay for a salary increase while, at the same time, cutting the number of service hours the state will pay for – which would result in a net lowering of Illinois state funding to DSP workers.

That means the 50-cent hourly increase in the base wage for DSP workers would cost $20 million for fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, helping meet some of the need. However, coalition research shows that a separate provision in the budget proposed by IDHS will actually lead to the loss of $32 million in state-funded DSP service hours.

The resulting cut in hours will affect the Community Integrated Living Arrangement, or CILA system, which allows individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live in community settings with partially or fully state-funded professional care. The overall result of the proposed budgetary action would lead to a net $12 million loss to DSP providers, according to the coalition.

“It’s like saying to somebody you’re getting a promotion, but we’re putting you down to part-time,” said Ann Morris, chief of communications and external affairs at Little City, a residential care facility in Inverness.

The They Deserve More coalition says the cut arising from the proposed budget amounts to the elimination of 895,000 state-funded service hours, which equates to 430 full-time DSP positions. This would force service providers to either lay off workers or fund the gap, according to Kathy Carmody, CEO of the Institute on Public Policy for People with Disabilities.

“Agencies, they have no revenue stream other than Medicaid,” Carmody said. “You can’t have a bake sale to raise base wages for your DSPs.”

Family members of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities said the cut would be painful.

“Our direct service professionals are more than just workers, they’re part of the disability community family,” Hernandez said. “They come alongside each client and they help them live and work in the community… So the turnaround is like taking a family member away from them.”



[caption id=""attachment_64083"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""652""] An attendee of last week’s protest displays a sign reading “DSPs ROCK like MOVIE STARS – Stephanie K.” (Medill Illinois News Bureau photo by Maggie Dougherty)[/caption]



The hours cut would also interrupt the consistency of care that individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities receive, according to their family members. Lena Grant’s brother is autistic and nonverbal, meaning that having staff he knows at Cornerstone is crucial to his care.

“It’s very important that the people who care for him are there consistently, because he can’t speak, he can’t communicate his needs, so the people that work there get used to him and understand him and know what his behaviors and his body language and all that means,” Grant said.

Employee turnover means repeatedly training new people on his needs, according to Burneva McCullam, who shares guardianship of their brother with Grant. “That’s hard on Cornerstone, that’s hard on us,” McCullum said.

The governor’s office and IDHS both said this is not the intention. “Providers will never be told ‘you’ve reached your hours limit’ or be forced to lay off support workers,” the governor’s press secretary Alex Gough said in an email. “The global hours total is part of a funding model with multiple parts, designed to fairly and equitably distribute limited resources.” IDHS sent an email using identical language.

Gough said there is no limit on the number of hours providers can employ DSPs, but the coalition argues that cuts in state funding for service hours will reduce the state help providers receive and add pressure to an already strained system.

Budget

Representatives on both sides of the aisle expressed frustration with the proposed IDHS budget during a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services in April.

“We’re telling you that the (developmental disability) community is our priority, and yet we’re going to start cutting from them,” said Rep. Terra Costa Howard, D-Glen Ellyn, addressing IDHS Secretary Dulce Quintero and staff. “And so where are our priorities within this budget? I’m not sure if they’re actually reflected.”

Rep. Nabeela Syed, D-Palatine, asked IDHS whether DSP providers were consulted when deciding to reduce service hours in favor of higher wages. Quintero replied that providers were consulted during the Guidehouse study and that it “has been a very transparent process.”

However, providers in the They Deserve More coalition told Capitol News Illinois that they did not feel included in the decision-making process.

“I’ve been in every meeting, there’s not one that I missed,” Carmody said. “There was no consultation.”

A reduction in DSP service hours was first proposed in late 2023, but Carmody maintained there was an agreement that the current 28.5 million DSP hours would remain in place. She says the proposed budget cut amounting to 895,000 state-funded service hours came as a surprise.

“Why on earth would we have fought for over a year to stave off these cuts only to agree that it would only be a temporary measure? It’s preposterous. It’s counterintuitive,” said Carmody. “That was not the understanding. The understanding was that the community system would retain 28.5 million hours of DSP services.”

Carmody said some impacts on funding for DSPs were expected in future fiscal years, but not this year or to this extent. She also acknowledged the budgetary challenges of this fiscal year and said the current administration “hands-down” has done more than past administrations.

“Our administration has a very open, ongoing dialogue with the DD service providers and the trade associations who represent them,” said IDHS Director of Communications Rachel Otwell in an email. “We aim to be creative, dedicated partners with every organization working to empower people with disabilities to achieve their full potential.”

Rose accused Pritzker of failing to ensure those with intellectual and developmental disabilities were appropriately prioritized in the budget.

“The governor has never, never in six years made the developmentally disabled a priority,” Rose said. “He can say all he wants in speeches, when the bottom line is, his budgets don’t prove that out. In a budget, it’s ‘put your money where your mouth is.’”

The governor’s office and IDHS said that the proposed budget demonstrates the strength of Gov. Pritzker’s commitment by allocating $3 billion in funds to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, more than has ever been committed in the past.

“As the federal government dismantles and disinvests in disability services, we are committed to stabilizing and strengthening supports for people with disabilities in Illinois,” Gough said in an email. “The FY26 budget proposal moves us in that direction.”

As lawmakers work to hash out the details of the budget, the They Deserve More coalition encourages community members to keep pushing their legislators to support bills HB 2788 and SB 1690.

“We were told at the outset of the budget season this year that this was going to be a very tight budget, but we always remain hopeful that our voices will be heard,” Morris said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-23 20:59:12+00:00,CT Mirror,CT electric bills to drop slightly following new PURA ruling,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/23/pura-eversource-electric-bill-decrease-united-illuminating/,The change will result in about a $13 monthly decrease for average Eversource customers and a $3 decrease for United Illuminating customers.,"State regulators on Wednesday approved a slight decrease in Connecticut electric rates over the next year, driven largely by more favorable conditions surrounding the purchase of power from New England’s two nuclear power stations.
All three PURA commissioners voted unanimously to approve rate adjustments for both Eversource and United Illuminating customers.
According to PURA, the adjustment will result in approximately a $13 decrease for an average Eversource customer’s monthly bill and a $3 decrease for the typical United Illuminating customer. The exact amount of savings will vary depending on a customers’ usage and rate class.
The new rates will take effect on May 1 and may last for up to a year or until September, should PURA decide to make another adjustment then.
The reduction was the result of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s annual rate adjustment proceedings, in which regulators review and approve new rates associated with the transmission and public benefits portions of customers’ bills. 
The supply and distribution rates, which make up the bulk of electric bills, remain mostly unchanged by Wednesday’s decision. 
Claire Coleman, the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel, released a statement on Wednesday casting regulators’ decision as prudent given the large fluctuations in the cost of energy over the last year. Coleman’s office represents ratepayers before PURA. 
“This decision reflects OCC’s advocacy to consider both affordability as well as protecting customers from the impacts of market volatility and arrives at the best possible outcome,” Coleman said. 
“It is also clear that market fluctuations will impact the cost of electricity for the foreseeable future, and my team and I will continue to do everything we can to promote rate stabilization in the face of volatility,” she added. 
The biggest part of Wednesday’s adjustments was the result of changes in the cost of power purchase agreements with two nuclear power plants, New Hampshire’s Seabrook Station and the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford. Under those agreements, utilities are required to buy power from both plants, and the associated costs are passed onto customers through the public benefits charge.
The Millstone agreement, in particular, was widely blamed for a spike in electric bills last summer that coincided with a period of intense heat and rising demand for electricity.
When the price of wholesale electricity in New England rises above the set prices in those contracts, however, the utilities can sell the energy back into the grid at a profit that gets passed along to customers. That’s essentially what happened over the first few months of the year, according to drafts of PURA’s decision, allowing for a reduction in the public benefits charge. 
In its filings with PURA earlier this year, Eversource requested a return of $275 million to its customers as a result of the power purchase agreements. PURA initially proposed a more modest $45 million return, before ultimately settling on $142 million in Wednesday’s decision.
“Today’s decision from the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) relied on our evidence to revise its draft decision and increase the credit going back to customers through state-mandated power purchase agreements, including the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear power plant contracts,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement. “This adjustment to Public Benefits will provide additional relief to customers at a time when energy bills typically go up significantly due to increased electric usage in the summer months.”
PURA released an explanation of its decision Wednesday, which said that Eversource’s initial request was based on rosy predictions on the cost of wholesale energy related to the Millstone and Seabrook agreements. If those predictions did not pan out, the authority said, ratepayers would be at risk of having to make up those costs in future bills.
“Setting rates now that assume a $275 million ‘credit’ based on pure speculation, as suggested by Eversource, sharply increases the risk of substantial under-recovery, which would result in significant carrying charges and rate shock borne exclusively by customers,” the statement read. “This would necessitate a potentially large rate increase next May, imposing unnecessary financial burdens on customers.”
But, according to PURA, if those contracts with the power plants continue to produce dividends, rates could fall even more in September.
PURA also rejected Eversource’s request to charge customers $75 million to replenish the utility’s storm reserve accounts, after regulators questioned the utility’s rationale that it would save customers in the long run. 
In a statement on Wednesday, United Illuminating said the adjustment will decrease the utilities’ overall revenues by $10.3 million. 
“With the conclusion of the initial phase of the 2025 Rate Adjustment Mechanism (RAM) process today, PURA has set the Public Benefits Charge for UI customers, which pays for policymakers’ priority programs and which UI does not control or profit from,” spokeswoman Sarah Wall Fliotsos said in a statement. “We encourage our customers to contact their elected officials with any questions or concerns regarding this portion of their energy charges.” 
The decision came at a time of immense scrutiny for PURA and its chairwoman, Marissa Gillett. Lawmakers approved the appointments of both Gillett and the authority’s newest commissioner, David Arconti, last week following a months-long confirmation process.
Lawmakers have also debated how to find relief for Connecticut residents, who are paying some of the highest rates for electricity in the nation. Much of that debate has focused on the public benefits charge, a collection of programs mandated by state and federal policy but paid for out of utility bills. 
Republicans in the legislature have lobbied to take all those costs off customers’ bills and pay for them with taxpayer dollars in the state’s general fund. More recently, an alternative idea put forward by state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, would borrow roughly $2.4 billion over the next three years to cover the public benefits charge.
Fonfara’s legislation, Senate Bill 1560, was on the agenda Wednesday for the legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. However, by 5 p.m., the committee had yet to begin its deliberations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GILLETT-HEARING-0220-02-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 17:07:13.963958

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Senate committee on Wednesday advanced a measure that would nearly double the reimbursement rate for transporting juvenile defendants.
House Bill 1680 increases the reimbursement fee from $17 an hour to $32 an hour. The fee is paid by the Office of Juvenile Affairs to entities who transport their youth to the 11 facilities in the state, said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City, the Senate author.
The increased rate is expected to cost the Office of Juvenile Affairs about $124,800 a year, and the agency officials noted they would require an increase to their budget to pay for it, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.
Coleman said the last time the rate was increased was in the 1990s. Supporters said the increase is needed because it costs substantially more to transport the youth today than it did nearly three decades ago.
The measure passed the Senate appropriation’s committee 23-0. It heads to the full Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Democratic budget writers are done hashing out details on a new two-year operating budget for Washington state, key lawmakers said Wednesday.
“We have made all the decisions, but there’s still a lot of pieces that have to fall into place,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and chief architect of the Senate operating budget proposal.
She said details may not be available until Friday at the earliest. Senate leaders have said their goal is to release their operating budget by Saturday morning and vote on Sunday, the last scheduled day of session.
Robinson is one of four Democrats on the conference committee reconciling differences between the Senate and House spending plans. Two Republican lawmakers on the panel have not been at the table for negotiations.
There are all the signs of a deal on a new capital budget as well.
“We’re done with the numbers. This evening, we will finalize the language,” Rep. Steve Tharinger, D-Port Townsend, chair of the House Capital Budget Committee, told the Heritage Caucus early Wednesday morning. The group is made up of lawmakers, state agency staff, and nonprofit leaders, and works on public policy to promote heritage, arts, and science in the state.
Tharinger also had good news on the larger operating budget.
“My understanding,” he said, is that negotiators are, “as they say, ‘pencils down’ and they’re done with their work.” 
But, he cautioned, it is a very tight budget. They may need to adjust numbers if there are changes made to the revenue-raising bills getting voted on in the next couple of days. 
After hearing Tharinger, Sen. Judy Warnick, R-Moses Lake, a Heritage Caucus member, said it is “kind of good news about the pencils down.”
She confirmed the potential need to rejigger numbers, citing the number of budget-related bills moving through the process.
Two of those – House Bill 2081 and Senate Bill 5814 – are counted on to raise several billion dollars for the two-year budget that begins July 1.
Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, speaking to reporters Wednesday morning, said that while there is “every indication they finished negotiations,” what happens to the revenue bills is the wild card that could cause the budget to “go off the tracks.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1658-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-23 17:07:13.963958

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowans stressed the importance of health coverage and the difficulties of obtaining government recognition of medical conditions at the first public comment session on state’s effort to add work requirements to its expanded Medicaid program.
The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services is seeking a waiver from the federal government allow it to implement work requirements for the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, or IHAWP.  The public hearing Wednesday at the Urbandale Public Library was the first of three meetings for public comment required by the waiver submitted to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
IHAWP is the Medicaid expansion program signed into law by former Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican. It provides public health insurance for low-income Iowans at or below 133% of the federal poverty level who do not qualify for regular Medicaid coverage — people between the ages of 19 to 64 who do not have a disability.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The waiver, announced by Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier in April, proposes requiring IHAWP recipients to work 100 hours per month to remain eligible for coverage. There are other ways to meet this requirement — a person can continue receiving state health coverage if they are enrolled in an education or job skills program, or if they earn the equivalent in wages to working 100 hours a month at the state minimum wage, $7.25 per hour.
There are some exceptions for the work requirements. People who are considered medically frail or medically exempt under Medicaid  would not have to meet the work requirements, nor would individuals caring for a child under age 6, who have a high-risk pregnancy, or are in substance abuse treatment programs for up to six months. The waiver request also states that individuals who “provide proof of good cause as defined by HHS” would be exempt, but did not include details on what standards would be used by the state department for assessing these claims.
At the hearing, several speakers talked about their own experiences or time helping others applying for public assistance coverage under the current Medicaid program. Nancy Lynch of Des Moines, a former school social worker, said she worked with parents of children with disabilities who were denied services and assistance — and said she believes work requirements would add another hurdle for people in need accessing health coverage and care.
“My job was to help support parents who had children with very special needs that needed help — needed help with health care, needed help with services — and I saw how difficult it was for them to receive those services,” Lynch said. “No one got it on the first time. Everybody had to apply three and four times. They’d say the same thing, but they had to reapply and reapply and reapply. So they had to kind of beat down the system until they were finally accepted. … And my big concern is that these work requirements will add more barriers to people who need these services, they will lose the support they need.”
Robbin Mensching of West Des Moines said she was concerned about how HHS would assess mental illnesses and provide exemptions. Speaking about her own experience struggling to receive an official diagnosis of having a mental illness, she said it can be difficult for people with mental health issues to be recognized as having a medical issue. After receiving care, Mensching said she was able to more fully participate in life, but that denying that coverage could impact people’s ability to join the workforce or care for their families.
“I want to know how they’re going to handle covering these people, because there are a lot of people that have been like me,” Mensching said “Anxiety, depression, panic attacks — it’s disabling.”
Work requirements would be enforced through reporting. HHS stated that people on IHAWP would be required to report information showing the work requirements were met every six months. The department plans to create a mobile application for IHAWP members to submit required information showing their compliance with the work requirements if HHS does not already have the information available. If the required information is not provided, the individual’s coverage would be suspended.
Mary Nelle Trefz, the advocacy network director of Iowa ACES 360, called for the state to share information about the cost of implementing work requirements, pointing to the need for the Iowa state government to create a new information technology system and train staff to implement and support the reporting requirements.
As Reynolds and HHS pursue a waiver for implementing work requirements, the Iowa Legislature has also moved this session to pass a bill implementing expanded Medicaid work requirements. There are some differences between the HHS and legislative policies — the bill proposes an 80-hour monthly work requirement, and includes “trigger” language that would require the state to end IHAWP coverage for all recipients if the federal government revokes work requirements in the future after they were approved.
The legislation also includes an appropriation of roughly $8.2 million, according to the Legislative Services Agency, to set up the needed IT system for administering reporting requirements under the proposal. The funding to create this IT system is not a part of the HHS waiver request, Trefz said.
“That pending legislation also included support for IT, funding for that — but that legislation has not passed yet,” Trefz said. “Those dollars have not been appropriated. So how will the state ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place?”
Multiple speakers expressed frustration that the HHS staff who hosted the meeting did not answer several of the questions or direct responses from HHS or other state leadership posed about certain details of the policy or how it would be implemented, or if there would be changes made to address any of their concerns. Staff at the meeting said the comments and questions would be shared with state leaders, and would be used to answer questions about work requirements in future communications.
Mensching said she felt work requirements were already a “done deal” in Iowa, but said she believed it was important for Iowans — especially those who would be impacted by the change — to speak out.
“I would have ended up living on the street at one point in my life (without health coverage), and then you’ve got all these other things that go with that — somebody getting health care for me, the police would be involved — I mean, it just goes on and on,” Mensching said. “It’s so much more efficient and humane to just give people coverage so that they can live a normal life.”
Trefz, alongside Stacy Frelund with the American Heart Association, said they were creating a “protect Medicaid” coalition to coordinate organizing efforts to oppose the new work requirements.
There will be another public hearing held on the waiver request, on April 29 at 2 p.m. at Marshalltown Public Library. Comments can also be submitted through email and by mail through May 15, with information available on the public notice website for the waiver.

Reed Ingram, R-Pike Road, sits on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on April 25, 2024 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill seeking to remove certain food additives from Alabama’s public K-12 schools faced discussion in the House Health Committee Wednesday, with proponents citing health concerns and opponents raising issues of regulatory burden and implementation timelines.
HB 491, sponsored by Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Matthews, would prohibit schools from selling or serving food items containing specific artificial colorings, including common dyes like Red No. 40 and Yellow No. 5. 
The committee held the bill for a vote next week to allow members to review a potential amendment.
“Europe has banned it years ago, and all we’re asking is just in the lunches, what’s in the schools,” Ingram said to the committee.

Ingram argued passionately against the additives and said he doesn’t “think we ought to keep giving our kids poison.”
“Why not take a proactive approach to save a life? … we’re prescribing so much medication now, it’s got to be something that we’re eating and something we’re doing,” Ingram said to the committee.
The scope of the bill focuses specifically on food provided by schools. It would not restrict items brought from home or shared by students for events like class parties.
Alabama House bills would target some food additives

But concerns were raised about the bill’s impact. Virginia Banister, executive director at Alabama Beverage Association, said the bill would create “unnecessary regulatory burdens, cost, consumer and retailer confusion.” She also said that it would undermine the role of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“HB 491 would place the state of Alabama in an unprecedented position in regulating food and beverage ingredients. That’s a role currently held by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,” Banister said.
In a recent interview, Ingram indicated that a push by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to “Make America Healthy Again” is allowing Republicans, who have historically opposed regulation, to talk about the issue. He also said that his grandchildren aren’t allowed to have synthetic dyes, which led him to learn more about the issue.
Kennedy has promoted numerous controversial and unfounded views around public health issues. He has made false claims about the safety of vaccines and the impact of environmental chemicals on a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity. He has also baselessly connected anti-depressant use to school shootings and has advocated for raw milk consumption despite health risks.
California banned Red Dye No. 3 in 2023 after a state report raised concerns about its link to increased youth ADHD and questioned federal safety levels for children. The FDA recently followed, announcing a Red Dye No. 3 ban in food effective in early 2027 and 2028 in drugs. Research continues on the safety of other food dyes.

State records indicate Sammarra Smith, 55, served as the administrator of West Des Moines’ Promedica Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, later renamed Harmony West Des Moines, from November 2020 through June 2023.
The Iowa Board of Nursing Home Administrators alleges that in June 2023, when Smith was still overseeing the day-to-day operations of the home, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing identified several regulatory violations related to Smith’s work.
Earlier this year, the Iowa Board of Nursing Home Administrators charged Smith with violating an unspecified rule or regulation related to the profession.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board noted that while Smith was in charge at Harmony West, state inspectors cited the home for failing to administer a home in a way that maintained the well-being of all residents; failing to adequately evaluate residents’ needs in terms of the home’s staffing needs; failing to make a good-faith effort to correct deficient practices at the home; failing to ensure a qualified infection preventionist was employed at the home; and failing to ensure that nurse aides completed their training.
To resolve the licensing-board charges, Smith recently agreed to surrender her license — although that action has little practical effect given the fact that her license expired in December 2023. Smith agreed to surrender the license with the understanding that she can apply for reinstatement in one year.
State inspection reports indicate Harmony West was cited for numerous violations, in addition to those cited by the Board of Nursing Home Administrators, during Smith’s time at the home.
In February 2023, state inspectors visited the home to investigate a backlog of 23 complaints, and cited the home for 20 state and federal violations. One of the issues related to a resident who died after being sent to the emergency room with an anal fissure and gangrene that the home allegedly failed to treat. The resident had been “screaming and you could hear it down the hall,” a licensed practical nurse reportedly told inspectors.
In May 2023, inspectors returned to investigate a backlog of 11 additional complaints, some of which were directly related to Smith’s conduct. During interviews with state inspectors, two workers at the home reported they were hesitant to speak due to fear of retaliation. Four workers alleged the administrator and director of nursing had told them that when the inspectors asked questions “they needed to respond everything was fine” and “if they wanted a paycheck they better not say anything bad.”
One worker reportedly told inspectors the administrator was falsifying records by backdating documents and directing other workers to falsify records. Other workers alleged the daily work-assignment sheets made it appear the home was adequately staffed, but in reality some of the employees were not actually scheduled to work.
State records show a federal fine of $101,177 was later imposed against the home, and a temporary manager was placed in charge of the facility.

The local option sales tax revenues collected by local governments and the 1-cent sales tax that goes to Iowa schools each would decline by just over $1 million a year, LSA estimated. The bottom line: A total savings of $9.1 million annually for consumers by 2030.
Hermanson noted that the state also exempts sales taxes on other necessities such as food and medicine.
“The bill recognizes toilet paper is not a luxury, it’s not a choice, it’s a necessity. And I think we can all agree, taxing it stinks,” he said.
Rep. Aime Wichtendahl, D-Hiawatha, rolled with the puns, adding that it was “time that we flush away this sales tax on toilet paper.”
The bill is one of several proposals this session to remove the sales tax from the purchase of household necessities, such as tampons, soap and laundry detergent.  A separate bill removing the tax from vitamins and minerals also passed the House on Wednesday.

The board came under scrutiny in 2023 when Gov. Ned Lamont removed then-board chair Carleton Giles after the board approved 71 sentence commutations in 2023 — a massive jump in comparison to earlier years, where fewer than five commutations were granted per year. Lamont also suspended commutations for a period of time.
Keays has worked with Children with Incarcerated Parents Initiative, a project under UConn’s Institute for Municipal Regional Policy, since 2007. The project provides services for children with incarcerated family members — for instance, collaborating with the Department of Correction to build a playground at York Correctional Institution and create “child-family” visiting spaces at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution. 
The initiative also conducts studies on the needs of these children and the efficacy of certain programs designed to support them. 
Tsarkov serves as the executive director of the Connecticut Sentencing Commission, a 23-member panel tasked with making recommendations to the governor on changes to the state’s criminal justice system. Before that, he oversaw contracts that the Judicial Branch made with nonprofits for programs offered to pre-trial individuals or people on probation. 
Republican lawmakers questioned whether the applicants had enough experience working with victims of crime. Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said members of the board needed to be “neutral” in their decisions when modifying someone’s sentence or approving parole. 
Fishbein questioned whether Keays would consider herself an “advocate,” a term that she pushed back on. She said the decision to offer a pardon or to parole an incarcerated individual needed to be based on a wide variety of circumstances, including that individual’s behavior since the crime was committed, how the crime impacted a victim and the potential for that incarcerated person to be a risk to public safety. 
“I do not want to be part of a decision that leads to victimization in the future. I take that very seriously. I do have a young daughter. I think about her welfare all the time. As a parent, as a female, I think about my safety and welfare,” Keays said. 
Keays noted that many people who commit crimes were also, at some point, victims of crime themselves. But she said that if she were on the fence, she would be more likely to lean toward continued incarceration rather than release. 
Keays said she believed parole allowed people who were demonstrating remorse and changed behavior to reenter their communities at an appropriate time, before falling further into the criminal justice system or losing connections they had in the community. It also gives them the opportunity to modify or revoke parole if need be. 
“If we don’t afford … that opportunity to check in with a board of experts who have been trained or are going to look at this seriously, then we lose that opportunity to let them out under community supervision. We also know that community supervision has much greater success in terms of a reduction in reoffending than end-of-sentence,” she said. 
Tsarkov said he also had little experience working directly with victims of crime, besides some work on legislation with the Sentencing Commission. But he said victim input was important for the Board of Pardons and Paroles. 
“Victims have constitutional statutory rights here in Connecticut to be notified of a hearing and to participate in the hearing by providing a statement, and I think those statements are very powerful,” he said. “I think they should be acknowledged, valued and respected throughout the process.”
Tsarkov said he expected the Board of Pardons and Paroles to be “the toughest job I’ve ever had” but said he was looking for “a real challenge.”
“I think the board plays such an important role in the criminal justice system when it comes to public safety and rehabilitation. I think the board members do a tremendous job,” he said. 
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, warned the nominees that being on the Board of Pardons and Paroles required them to be “like the actuary of human behavior” — that it was a difficult job that became visible to the public only when the wrong decision was made.     
Rep. Patrick Callahan, R-New Fairfield, also emphasized the need to include victims in their calculus. 
“When it comes to making decisions on the board of pardons and parole, the person on paper may have done everything right, but I hope you can consider that there was a victim in many of these cases, there was a victim and there’s community safety involved,” he said. 
The committee will vote on the nominations on Friday.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The effort to overturn a controversial bill that bans public sector unions from collective bargaining is moving forward, having met the signature threshold in four of 15 Utah Senate districts, and clearing the halfway mark for the statewide requirement. 
Utah has one of the more difficult referendum processes in the country, advocates say, with a high bar to qualify. The Protect Utah Workers coalition had 30 days to gather signatures from at least 8% of the state’s registered voters, roughly 141,000 people. 
Last week, the coalition announced it was submitting about 320,000 signatures, going well above the minimum requirement and, if accurate, making the effort to overturn HB267 one of the most successful in state history. If the county clerks and the lieutenant governor’s office validate enough signatures, voters will decide whether the law should be repealed during the 2026 General Election.

As of Wednesday, data from the lieutenant governor’s office showed county clerks have verified at least 79,145 signatures, more than halfway toward one of the two requirements outlined in state code. 
The coalition must also gather signatures from 8% of registered voters in at least 15 of Utah’s 29 state Senate districts. Data analyzed by political consulting and public affairs firm Morgan & May showed the coalition has met that threshold in four districts: 

Sen. Todd Weiler’s District 8, which encompasses North Salt Lake, Woods Cross, Bountiful and parts of Salt Lake City
Sen. Jen Plumb’s District 9 in Salt Lake City
Sen. Nate Blouin’s District 13, which includes parts of Salt Lake City, Millcreek, South Salt Lake and Murray
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher’s District 14, in Salt Lake City, Millcreek, Holladay and Murray. 

Weiler’s district in Davis County is the only GOP-held district so far where the county clerk has verified enough signatures to meet the 8% threshold. 
Labor coalition shatters threshold to qualify for referendum in effort to repeal union bill

According to Morgan & May, 10 other districts are at least 50% complete, with District 11 (much of Tooele County, and parts of West Valley City down to Eagle Mountain) at 49%. Democratic Sen. Kathleen Reibe’s District 15 (parts of Sandy, West Jordan and Cottonwood Heights) is the closest to meeting the requirement, at 82%. 
On Tuesday, the lieutenant governor’s office reported that at least 11,547 signatures have been rejected so far — that’s to be expected, the coalition said. It’s inevitable that some people may sign despite not being registered to vote in Utah, while others might sign twice, have illegible handwriting, or give incorrect voter information. 
That’s why the coalition sought to go above and beyond the minimum requirement of 141,000 votes. According to the figures from Tuesday, about 84% of the signatures submitted are being verified. 
Signed by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox in February, HB267 prohibits public sector unions from collective bargaining, the process where, for instance, a teachers union negotiates an employment contract with a school district. The bill takes effect July 1, 2025. 
Lawmakers say HB267 will protect taxpayer dollars while giving all public employees a voice, not just union members. If a teachers union only represents one third of the employees in a school district, it shouldn’t be able to negotiate employment contracts on behalf of everyone, said the bill sponsors, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, and Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Salt Lake City’s police and fire departments, and a handful of the state’s school districts, are the only public unions that engage in collective bargaining, and supporters of the bill say the ban would only impact a small number of Utah’s labor organizations. 
But labor groups and members of the public protested the bill at every step, concerned that it would erode their rights and eliminate leverage unions have when meeting with their employers. 
Once Cox signed the bill, the opposition morphed into the Protect Utah Workers coalition — among them are the Utah State Fraternal Order of Police, the Utah Education Association, Professional Firefighters of Utah, Teamsters Local 222, the Salt Lake Valley Law Enforcement Association, United Mine Workers and more.
Cox last week reiterated that despite signing it, he didn’t like the bill and was hoping lawmakers and unions would find a compromise to still allow them to collectively bargain. Now that it’s escalated to a referendum attempt, the governor said he’s impressed by the coalition’s work. 
“I want to congratulate them for their signatures,” Cox said during his monthly PBS news conference. “To get 300,000 signatures is very impressive. People ask if I was surprised and I said I’m actually not surprised. It’s called organized labor for a reason.” 
Still, the governor was hesitant to say whether the number of signatures translates to support to repeal the bill. 
“I don’t know what that means,” he said. “I don’t know if you can extrapolate the number of signatures to broad public support over the course of a year and a half, which is when the vote will take place.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/032625_Union-Referendum_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 17:07:13.963958

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier’s X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier sent a letter to law enforcement Wednesday stating that he won’t stop them from enforcing a temporarily blocked state immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen last week.
Uthmeier’s letter states that he doesn’t believe law enforcement has to abide by the order from a federal judge in Miami prohibiting the state from enforcing the law, which makes it a first-degree misdemeanor to illegally enter the state as an “unauthorized alien” and adds heightened penalties for re-entry.
At the direction of U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams, Uthmeier sent a memo to law enforcement Friday, writing that they shouldn’t make arrests under the law. This week’s letter, however, states that he won’t stand in the way of arrests under the law Gov. Ron DeSantis signed on Feb. 13 and Williams blocked on April 4.
“I cannot prevent you from enforcing §§811.102 and 811.103, where there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” Uthmeier wrote to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Highway Patrol, sheriffs, and police chiefs.
The letter could draw the ire of Williams during the next scheduled hearing on April 29. The judge for the Southern District of Florida expressed frustration Friday about the ongoing enforcement of the law, bringing up the arrest by a FHP trooper of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, the 20-year-old born in Georgia.
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting of the arrest without probable cause on Thursday and Lopez-Gomez’s subsequent release from the Leon County Jail.
Although Williams specified on Friday that her order applied to law enforcement, Uthmeier maintains that it doesn’t because FDLE, FHP, sheriffs, and police departments are not named defendants in the suit brought against the state by the Florida Immigrant Coalition, Farmworker Association of Florida Inc., and two women lacking permanent legal status.
Alana Greer, director of the Community Justice Project, wrote in a statement to the Phoenix that the group worries more arrests will happen. The project represents the plaintiffs in the suit along with the ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Florida Legal Services.
“A federal judge entered not one, but two clear and direct orders stopping enforcement of this law,” Greer wrote. “The Attorney General’s letter makes us gravely concerned that Floridians will continue to be arrested under this unconstitutional statute. We will be back in court to ensure their rights are protected.”
Sheriff won’t go against federal judge
  Bob Gualtieri via Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office.
Not all law enforcement is on board with continuing enforcement despite the judge’s order.
Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, a member of the State Immigration Enforcement Council established earlier this year, told the Phoenix that his deputies won’t arrest anyone under its provisions. Gualtieri had not seen Uthmeier’s Wednesday letter but said nothing could make him disobey the judge’s order.
“I don’t think it changes anything,” Gualtieri said of the letter during a phone interview. “We take our direction on something like that from the judge, not from anybody else.”
DeSantis backed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, in a post on X: “Immigration law must be enforced and FL is leading on working with the Trump administration to get it done.” The governor had previously criticized Williams’ order temporarily blocking the law, referring to her as an activist judge during an April 7 press conference.
The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles did not respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment about whether troopers would continue arrests.
A spokesperson for the department wrote to the Phoenix on Friday, stating that FHP would keep working with federal partners to engage in interior enforcement of immigration law.

Local governments could face clawbacks if Merit Energy wins tax exemption intended for ""transportation"" companies.
The post Wyoming Supreme Court weighs $3M dispute over fuel industry tax break appeared first on WyoFile .","Millions of dollars are at stake for oil and gas producing counties in a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court to decide whether a sales tax exemption applies to companies that used electricity to move their products from wellheads to a point of sale. 
The Department of Revenue is asking the Wyoming Supreme Court to overturn a 2024 State Board of Equalization ruling in favor of Merit Energy Company, which says it is entitled to a $3 million sales tax refund — in addition to earlier refunds — for the electrical power it purchased from 2020 through 2023 to transport oil and gas via pipeline. 
Entangled in the lawsuit is electrical provider PacifiCorp, which seeks to collect the refund on Merit’s behalf. If the court sides with PacifiCorp and Merit, it could financially burden local governments that have received sales tax revenues based on the Department of Revenue’s interpretation of the sales tax exemption.
Park County officials, for example, said last year they were stunned to learn that local governments there might have to repay about $743,000, the Powell Tribune reported.
If Merit wins, other oil and gas companies will likely file for similar refunds, resulting in revenue “clawbacks” to the tune of “millions of dollars, but not tens of millions,” impacting most counties where there’s oil and gas production, according to a Department of Revenue official.

No matter which way the court rules, Merit’s view of the sales tax exemption will be enshrined in state statute, beginning July 1. House Bill 311, “Exemption for transported fuel and power sales-amendments,” passed earlier this year, clarifies that such utility expenses qualify.
‘Transportation’ or ‘gathering’?
The soon-to-be-outdated state sales tax exemption in question before the court applies to “Sales of power or fuel to a person transporting tangible personal property by railroad or by pipeline when the power or fuel is consumed directly in generating motive power for actual transportation purposes.”
The case hinges on whether or not Merit — and presumably other oil and gas producers in the state — qualify as a “transportation” company when it comes to moving their products to purchase points in the pipeline network.
Merit, one of the top oil and gas producers in the state, says the Department of Revenue has waffled on the classification, arguing on some occasions that oil and gas producers are in the business of transporting goods while also arguing they are not primarily transportation companies.

“Merit is in the oil and gas transportation business,” Merit attorneys wrote in a brief filed with the court on Monday. “It gets paid to transport other entities’ oil from wellheads to a point of sale. Merit is thus no different than an interstate trucking company or a railroad, except that instead of using trucks and roads or locomotives and rails, Merit uses submersible electric pumps and pipelines.”
The Department of Revenue, in a March brief, noted that Board of Equalization Vice-Chairman Martin L. Hardsocg dissented in the board’s ruling. Rather than transporting, according to Hardsocg’s dissent, Merit is in the business of “gathering” petrol commodities, which is more closely tied to production.
“Because Merit’s primary function is to operate various units and produce and sell oil and gas, including moving oil through a gathering system, it does not meet the statutory requirements for the exemption because it is not in the business of transporting oil through a pipeline,” according to the department’s brief.
No hearing dates have been set in the case initiated in January.

(Photo by Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)More states are enacting bans on “Glock switches,” small devices about the size of a U.S. quarter that can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.
Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.
SC governor signs permit-less carry bill into law

In South Carolina, anything that converts a weapon into a “machine gun,” defined in state law as any gun that can fire more than one bullet without reloading by a single pull of the trigger, has been illegal since 1990.
Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices. But the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”
 Recovered at crime scenes

The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.

The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.

Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department.
The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”
 Alabama and New Mexico

Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Democratic state Rep. Phil Ensler, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.










This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– Democratic Alabama state Rep. Phil Ensler




According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.


New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.

“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.
 Lawsuits against Glock

Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

(NIOSH | Courtesy photo)U.S. District Judge Irene Berger has scheduled a hearing for next month in a case against Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over federal cuts affecting the NIOSH facility in Morgantown. 
Kanawha County coal miner Harry Wiley filed the lawsuit April 7 in United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. 
More than 200 employees of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility in Morgantown were part of a reduction in force earlier this month as a part of a restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services. The changes, meant to save $1.8 billion a year, will reduce HHS staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees. 
The Morgantown facility plays a crucial role in detecting black lung among the nation’s coal miners through its Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program. 
According to Wiley’s complaint, the NIOSH office typically interprets miners’ lung X-rays and informs them of any rights they have under the federal Part 90, a provision of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act that allows miners developing black lung to move to a lower dust area of the mine. 
Wiley learned last year that he was developing black lung disease, his attorney, Sam Petsonk said. He mailed an X-ray of his lungs to the Morgantown NIOSH office in November 2024, but has not heard back from the program.
“He did exactly the right thing,” Petsonk said. “He said, ‘Well, shoot, I want to get out of the dust before I become totally disabled by this disease.’ And he filed back in November, which is over six months ago, to transfer, and they were processing his application. 
“And at this point, due to the closure of the program, it appears he’s unable to exercise his job transfer rights. So he is still working every day, facing hazardous dust, knowing that he’s already got coal mine dust scarring in his lungs, and that the further exposure is definitely compounding the severity of his disease,” he said. 
The job cuts included most of NIOSH’s critical employees, including the chief medical officer who oversees the black lung screening, the lawsuit states. 
The complaint was filed on Wiley’s behalf and other miners in his situation. Petsonk said he’s not sure how many there are. About 20% of central Appalachian coal miners have black lung disease, he said. The disease rate has increased in recent years and the illness has been identified more in younger miners due to a lack of easily accessible coal and an increase in the amount of silica-rich sandstone they have to dig through to reach what remains.
Many miners use the Part 90 program to transfer to lower dust areas of mines until their families can figure out a new plan to retrain or get another job, he said. 
Between 70 and 100 West Virginia miners participate in the Part 90 program now, and participation has increased tenfold over the last few years because of education and advocacy, he said. 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito on Tuesday sent a letter to Kennedy, asking him to reinstate the NIOSH workers.
In an emailed statement Tuesday, a spokesperson for Health and Human Services said that “The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), along with its critical programs, will join the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) alongside multiple agencies to improve coordination of health resources for Americans.”
Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3430, said in a news release this week the affected employees appreciate Capito’s support. 
“We are encouraged and grateful to see Sen. Capito taking a strong stand in support of the  critical work carried out by NIOSH,” Tinney-Zara said. “The research and services provided by NIOSH are not only essential to protecting the health and safety of workers across the nation, they are truly unique, with no equivalent elsewhere in the federal government.” 
The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 7 at the federal courthouse in Charleston.

Jimmy Higdon, who is calling for an extension of the May 7 deadline. (ky.gov photo)Republicans in the Kentucky Senate are calling on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to extend a federal deadline set for next month for travelers to have a REAL ID to board domestic flights and access other federal facilities. 
A REAL ID is a type of identification card, including driver’s licenses, with enhanced security protections issued by states following Congress’ passage of the REAL ID Act in 2005. 
After years of delays in requiring usage of these enhanced IDs, Kentuckians and people in other states have until May 7 before a REAL ID is needed to enter federal facilities, such as military bases or to get through airport security checkpoints to board domestic flights. 
  Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, chairs the Kentucky Senate Transportation Committee. (LRC photo)
Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebonan, in a letter co-signed by other Republican state senators called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to extend the deadline because Kentuckians need more time to obtain REAL IDs.
“While the intent behind the implementation of REAL ID is understandable, we believe the practical impact on Kentuckians must also be considered,” Higdon wrote in his April 17 letter. “Despite significant progress, Kentucky is simply not fully prepared for complete implementation.” 
Higdon also asked for “more time to help Kentuckians understand that they may not need a REAL ID.” Standard driver’s licenses will still be valid for daily use within the state, he stressed. He encouraged people to review their options and choose the form of identification that best fits their circumstances.
Higdon, the chair of the Kentucky Senate Transportation Committee, in a column posted to the social media platform X wrote many people have contacted him “about the inconvenience of renewing a driver’s license these days” including long wait times at regional driver’s licensing state offices and a new requirement of a vision test to renew a driver’s license. 
A recent report by CBS News found many states are lagging in the percentage of citizens who have a REAL ID. According to data compiled by CBS News from state motor vehicle departments, in 30 states fewer than 70% of IDs are compliant with REAL ID standards. New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate at 17%, while Kentucky had a compliance rate of about 36%. 
Higdon in his column wrote that other forms of federal identification, such as passports and passport cards, can be used as an alternative to a REAL ID to get through airport security.

He's the second GOP candidate to enter the race, joining McDonough Republican Sen. Brian Strickland. No Democrats announced a bid for the seat yet. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLong-time Athens GOP state Sen. Bill Cowsert has jumped into the race for Georgia’s next attorney general.
The seat is being vacated by sitting Republican Attorney General Chris Carr, who launched his campaign for governor late last year. Carr has been the state’s top law enforcement official for nearly a decade.
Cowsert, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006, touted his work on a special investigative committee focused on Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, whose office indicted President Donald Trump and 18 others in the 2020 election interference case. Willis was disqualified last year by the Georgia’s Court of Appeals for misconduct because of a relationship she had with the special prosecutor in the case, and that case has largely stalled. 
A controversial bill sponsored by Cowsert this year expands that committee’s scope to also examine groups affiliated with Stacey Abrams after the New Georgia Project, a left-leaning voter engagement organization she founded, settled long-running ethics allegations in January.
If elected, Cowsert said he would work to make sure “illegal immigrants, sex traffickers, violent gangs and fentanyl pushers are too afraid to cross the state line.”
He also took a swipe at his hometown.
“Let me be clear. I will use every power allowed by law to slam the door shut on sanctuary cities like my hometown of Athens,” he said. “Our Georgia will no longer tolerate the musings of extremist liberals more concerned with hurting the feelings of Venezuelan gang members in our country illegally than they are with keeping young women from being brutally murdered and raped. Her name was Laken Riley.  We will say her name, and we will not allow this to happen again in Georgia.”
Riley was a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed in February 2024 while jogging at the University of Georgia. A Venezuelan immigrant authorities say crossed into the U.S. illegally, Jose Ibarra, was sentenced to life in prison last year. Riley’s murder became a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration.
Cowsert, who grew up in Macon, is the founding partner of Cowsert Heath LLP in Athens, a “small town” law firm that handles cases from northeast Georgia down to Macon, according to its website. He also chairs the Senate Regulated Industries and Utilities Committee. 
Cowsert will face fellow Sen. Brian Strickland in the GOP primary for the seat. Strickland, a McDonough Republican and attorney who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, became the first candidate for attorney general when he filed his paperwork early this month just before lawmakers wrapped up the 2025 legislative session. 
No Democrats have announced a bid for the office yet.
Qualifying for the 2026 election is still a year away, but the prospect of open seats in a competitive state has prompted many candidates to get a jumpstart on the campaign trail.

More states are enacting bans on “Glock switches,” small devices about the size of a U.S. quarter that can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.
Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.

Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices, but the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”

Recovered at crime scenes

The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.
The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.

Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department. The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”

Alabama and New Mexico

Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.










This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery


According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.
New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.

“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.

Lawsuits against Glock

Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

His 2023 book, “The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War,” was a National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist for Nonfiction, and his book, “The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power,” was the basis for a 2019 Netflix documentary series,  for which he was narrator and executive producer. Sharlet’s writing on current politics can be found on his Substack, Scenes from a Slow Civil War.Sharlet describes his work as “reporting on the intersection of religion and politics.”He no longer characterizes the current state of politics and polarization as a “slow civil war.”“When I talk to young trans people, they’re not paranoid when they say their state wants them not to exist. They are correct. That’s sped up. The removal of books, the erasure of history, the threat to the universities, which is a hallmark (of) authoritarianism — this is textbook.”“Everything Trump has said he was going to do, he has attempted to do. It’s time to lay aside the ‘this is just negotiating tactics.’ He’s going to negotiate us right down into full fascism.”Sharlet has written about the carefully crafted imagery of authoritarianism that is on display right now. He singled out Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s visit to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where she posed “in tight athleisure” outfit while wearing a $50,000 Rolex watch in front of a backdrop of caged shirtless men who had allegedly been deported from the U.S. “It’s very powerful theater,” he said. “Authoritarian movements do not make policy recommendations. They put on theatrical productions. They do not persuade with arguments. They bludgeon with images.” Sharlet recently returned from reporting trips to Idaho and upstate New York, in Rep. Elise Stefanik’s district. I asked how MAGA supporters whom he encountered were feeling about Trump’s performance, including the predicted economic impact on red states of tariffs, social security and Medicaid cuts, inflation, government layoffs, and the price of eggs – up 60% compared to a year ago.“There’s a lot of people who are pleased with this and there is an increasing radicalization,” he said.“There used to be a Q-Anon slogan called ‘trust the plan,’ and that’s the ethos of the politics: trust the plan.”MAGA supporters told him that “they’re pleased about crackdowns on trans people. A lot of people are really, really happy about crackdowns on colleges.” He described how a member of a church that he visited in Spokane, Washington, “were thrilled. They feel like religious freedom is finally being established.”“I think people are taking false reassurance of saying, ‘Well, he’s hurting his own base.’ Of course, he’s hurting his own base. Fascism is not a good deal. It’s not a good deal for anybody. But you break government, and then you have your complete control over it. The goal is power, and with power comes the ability to enrich those who are close to you. It comes with the power to satisfy both your own ideological projects and those of your allies.”On the left, Sharlet said “there’s much more tuning out than the first Trump administration.”  He said that people opposed to Trump “have to build coalitions that are not just the people who have the right political ideas. We have to have coalitions with people who don’t normally think about politics, who don’t even have an opinion on it.”“Whatever we’re doing, it’s not enough. So good.

Critics of the plan though said providing carving out funding for schools only located at military installations does nothing to help other communities that need state assistance to upgrade their own aging school infrastructure.
Sen. Todd Gollihare, R-Kellyville, said House Bill 2516 creates the Base Infrastructure Needs and Development-Schools Revolving Fund, which would serve as the framework for lawmakers to spend funds to improve public schools on military installations. The funding would be aimed at decreasing the likelihood of military base closures or increasing the chances of expansion. 
While the measure does not yet provide any direct funding for the schools, he said lawmakers are looking at potentially investing about $21 million to make needed repairs to education infrastructure at military installations in Enid, Altus and McAlester. Under proposed budget talks, the school at Vance Air Force Base in Enid would receive about $5 million and Altus Air Force Base’s school would receive about $6.2 million. He said legislators are also considering providing funding for a 2-mile road project at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant.
Gollihare said the public schools at Altus and Vance air force bases were built in the 1960s and are owned and operated by local school districts within the boundaries of the military installations. The schools are included on a federal priority list that identifies them as being outdated, in disrepair, in need of upgrading or having too many students and not enough capacity, he said.
They are part of the federally-run Public Schools on Military Installations program. Under the program, which was created by former Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe, the federal government contributes 80% of the project’s cost while the state or local community provides the remaining 20%, Gollihare said. Federal grants can be used to build, repair, renovate, or expand schools.
He said while the Altus and Enid schools could theoretically use local bonds to pay for the construction, his understanding is both districts have already reached bonding capacity.
Gollihare said this funding would represent an investment in the two bases which have a combined economic impact of over $1.2 billion and employ over 3,300 civilians and 3,500 military personnel.
Sen. Roland Pederson, R-Burlington, said the legislation is very important to keep the Vance Air Force Base in Enid and to preserve the region’s quality of life and the K-6th grade school.
“It’s a good deal for the base and a good deal for the area,” Pederson said.
But Sen. Carri Hicks, D-Oklahoma City, who voted against the legislation, said lawmakers need to “invest adequately in all public schools,” to address infrastructure issues equally statewide.
“I understand that these particular facilities might be in disrepair, but I think that it is incredibly important that we continue to point out that there are additional facilities in our local communities currently that have the same conditions, and so carving out a specific subset does not ensure that all students have the same opportunities,” she said.
The measure, which has already cleared the state House, passed the Senate budget committee by 19-4 vote. It is now eligible to be heard in the Senate.

(Photo by Perry Beeman/Iowa Capital Dispatch))Senators advanced a bill Wednesday to create regulations and insurance requirements for adding roofs on boat docks, slips or lifts in Iowa.
Senate File 710 allows individuals to build roofs over boat slips or lifts so long as they are less than 30 feet wide, no more than 20 feet above the water and made from rust-resistant materials. The roofs may be constructed with the intent of protecting a boat slip or hoist. 
Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, added an amendment to the bill, which was adopted, to swap the bill’s original language regulating an “enclosed structure” on a dock to “roof.”
The bill stipulates the dock owners must maintain dock liability insurance of at least $1 million per occurrence, and that owners will be responsible for any damages caused during construction of the roof.

Sen. Dave Sires, R-Cedar Falls, said he had “a lot of issues” with the bill, which he said would allow large docks to be built when there is “limited oversight or background regulation” on the construction and removal of existing docks. 
“Improperly constructed or maintained docks can break loose and cause significant damage to neighboring properties and public infrastructure during floods and high winds,” Sires said. 
Sires said flooding events in 2024 highlighted the issue when “improperly anchored” docks caused “widespread damage” ​​in Iowa waterways. Sires held that roofs on the docks would cause even more damage. 
He additionally took issue that the bill would allow plumbing and electricity to the roofed docks, which he said could be used for a bed and breakfast. 
The bill states that the roofed docks may not be used for “sleeping purposes or habitation by a person,” but Sires was unconvinced that would stop people from sleeping on the docks. 
“Like nobody’s ever slept on their own boat or their own house boat,” he said. “And they’ll be doing that in the docks too,” Sires said. 
Sires said the bill would allow docks that are a “huge conglomerate” to sit on the lakes. 
“We all together own these lakes,” he said.  “When you start to put these monstrosities out there, it’s going to make it bad for everybody.”
The bill passed 44-4 from the Senate.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)As controversy continues to swirl around the Department of Defense following a second Signal group chat scandal, Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle on Wednesday to tout the work and goals of the Trump administration as he closes in on 100 days in office.
“Fighting for you is the privilege of a lifetime, a deployment of a lifetime. And from day one and each 100 of those days, our overriding objectives have been clear,” Hegseth said. “Restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and reestablishing deterrence.”
Hegseth claimed the department was “leaving wokeness and weakness behind” and instead “refocusing on lethality, meritocracy, accountability, standards and readiness.”
Hegseth’s speech followed reports from national outlets that he and others held group chats on Signal discussing U.S. military plans to strike Yemen that accidentally included Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, and a second group chat discussing classified information concerning the attack with his wife and brother.
Despite the recent controversies surrounding Hegseth, Trump and most Republicans have continued to back him leading the Department of Defense. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) on Monday became the first sitting GOP lawmaker to call for his resignation, following revelations about the second group chat.
During his speech in Cumberland County, Hegseth touted recent recruiting classes for the Army and Navy, saying their high numbers indicate positive momentum and that their message is resonating.
He claimed high standards are needed for those who want to serve in the military and boasted that “DEI”, an acronym for diversity, equity, and inclusion, was “dead at DOD.”
DEI was at the center of a Department of Defense controversy in March when a webpage honoring Jackie Robinson’s military service was temporarily removed and then later restored. The same occurred to pages highlighting prominent Native American figures in U.S. military history.
The Associated Press reported last week that Army and Air Force libraries, including the Army War College in Carlisle, were directed by the department to remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Hegseth’s staff has been undergoing changes as well. John Ullyot, the top spokesperson at the head of the department, announced last week that he is going to resign.
The secretary also celebrated the “partnership” his department has had with the Department of Government Efficiency, also known as DOGE, claiming they’ve identified $5.1 billion in savings. Most of Trump’s allies have defended the work of DOGE.
Recent polling shows Americans agree that the government is inefficient, but have a negative approval rating of DOGE’s job performance.
Hegseth also outlined a number of initiatives from the Trump administration in relation to foreign policy, including defending the southern border and ensuring allies abroad are stepping up to defend themselves. 
“Under the leadership of President Trump, the message to our adversaries in these first 100 days… has been undeniably clear,” he said. “America is back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
During his speech, Hegseth praised the Army War College as being one of the “vital institutions” for the military. Earlier this week, Trump announced that he’ll deliver the commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point.
Hegseth, who served as an officer in the Army National Guard and was a Fox News host, was one of the only cabinet selections from the Trump administration who failed to receive universal backing from Republicans. He was confirmed by a 50-50 vote, which required Vice President JD Vance to deliver the tie-breaking vote. U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, and Lisa Murkowski joined Democrats in voting in opposition, while 50 Republicans voted to confirm him. 
Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate delegation was split on the confirmation of Hegseth. U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, a freshman Republican who narrowly defeated longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in November and who served in the Army, voted to confirm him, while Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman joined all of his colleagues on his side of the aisle in opposition.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/petehegseth-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 16:07:25.312186

Throughout the[...],"Photo taken from the website KillTheDrillFl.org.The Florida Senate has joined the House in passing a bill (HB 1143) banning oil exploration and drilling near the Apalachicola River in Northwest Florida.
North Florida lawmakers filed the bill after the Florida Department of Environmental Protection permitted an exploratory oil well near the Apalachicola River in Calhoun County last December.
Throughout the legislative session, the bill sponsored in the Senate by North Florida Republican Corey Simon (SB 1300) did not match the language of the House proposal filed by Republican Jason Shoaf and Democrat Allison Tant.
On Wednesday, however, the Senate took up and passed the House version with an amendment prohibiting drilling, exploration, or production of oil, gas, or other petroleum products in counties designated as rural areas of opportunity that are 10 miles near a National Estuarine Research Reserve — meaning Gulf, Liberty, Franklin, and Calhoun counties.
The original House bill would have extended these protections to Guana Tolomato Matanzas in Ponta Verde Beach and Rookery Bay in Naples. Those are not included in the bill passed on Wednesday in the Senate.
The proposal also calls for the DEP to apply a “balancing test” when a permit application is submitted in areas within one mile inland from the coast or other bodies of water. The test must include the community’s conditions, hydrological connections, uniqueness, location, fish and wildlife use, time lag, and the potential cost of restoration in case of an explosion, blowout, or spill.
“Over the last several years, the Apalachicola area has been closed to our oystermen,” Simon said on the floor of the Senate. 
“And a few years back, when we had the Deepwater Horizon drilling incident, it closed down our Bay and it decimated our community. We can’t have that again. Our families are trying to struggle their way back currently, and this will go a long way in making sure that the Apalachicola can return back to its former self and all that it brings back to the Forgotten Coast.”
The final vote was 37-1, with only Broward County Democratic Sen. Rosalind Osgood opposing the measure.
Louisiana-based Clearwater Land & Minerals is the company intending to drill for oil in the Apalachicola River Basin. A challenge to the draft permit is pending at the state Division of Administrative Hearings, as reported by the News Service of Florida.

“I’m technically exploring, but ever so close,” he told Source NM Wednesday. “We’re working on various things, the narrative of the entire campaign,” he said.
Miyagishima, an insurance agent and the mayor of Las Cruces between 2007 to 2023, also held two terms on both the Las Cruces City Council and the Doña Ana County Commission.
On his website, Miyagishima said some of his policy positions would include: having the state build and sell homes at cost to “police, fire and correctional officers as well as teachers and eligible Native Americans.”
Miyagishima said he would also want to establish a new police force using retired officers to “assist larger cities with local policing.” Another crime policy, he said, would be having state government pay the federal government to house any person convicted of a crime resulting in the death of a police officer, firefighter or correctional officer.
“I believe the perpetrator should serve a mandatory life sentence at the SUPERMAX facility in Colorado,” his website says.
So far, the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary for governor has two official candidates: Former Interior Secretary and Congresswoman Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County district attorney Sam Bregman. Current Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham cannot run for reelection due to term limits.
There is only one Republican candidate announced so far, Rio Rancho mayor Greggory Hull.
Miyagishima reported no expenditures or his donations in the campaign account, telling Source NM that he planned to make contributions soon.
“This will all be new money, I’ll probably be lending myself a good chunk,” he said. According to the most recent campaign finance reports, Hull raised nearly $210,000; Bregman reported just over $632,000 and Haaland has raised more than $2.8 million.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2D79DDB6-A12F-445F-83FD-EEAA746EF3EE.jpeg,,,2025-04-23 16:07:25.312186

Even following a Supreme Judicial Court ruling in January against Milton that deemed the law constitutional and gave the attorney general's office the ability to enforce it with legal action, unrest remains in other communities — many of which are using Auditor Diana DiZoglio's contention that the law is an ""unfunded mandate"" to pursue further legal action.[...]","SOME GOP representatives are angling to reopen the controversial MBTA Communities Act conversation when the House takes up its budget next week.Of more than 1,600 amendments filed to the House Ways and Means Committee’s fiscal year 2026 budget, a few align with the small but vocal group of municipalities that continue to call on the state to reconsider its requirements for towns to comply with the zoning law. The law, which requires cities and towns with or near MBTA service to zone for multi-family housing by right in at least one reasonably sized district, was designed to help address the state’s housing supply shortage.Much of the public concern surrounding the law has revolved around Milton, a town deemed a “rapid transit community” because it hosts the light-rail Mattapan trolley, which some have argued is not equivalent to the rest of the T’s core transit system. Even following a Supreme Judicial Court ruling in January against Milton that deemed the law constitutional and gave the attorney general’s office the ability to enforce it with legal action, unrest remains in other communities — many of which are using Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s contention that the law is an “unfunded mandate” to pursue further legal action.House Minority Leader Brad Jones is one of two GOP lawmakers who filed amendments proposing adjustments to the mandate, which come after House Speaker Ron Mariano said in early April that he is not considering exempting individual towns from compliance, while admitting that he thinks Milton had a “legitimate complaint” about the mandatory zoning law. One of the North Reading Republican’s amendments would extend the mandate requirements to every city and town in Massachusetts; another would not deem municipalities as “MBTA communities” if they do not have direct bus, subway or transit service.Jones is also pushing to make compliance retroactive via a different amendment that would enable municipalities with “qualifying construction projects completed within the past 5 years” to be considered when determining compliance.“If this is about housing, why don’t we look at what communities have done? In my hometown of North Reading, we’ve built 500 units of housing in the past five years. Why don’t we get any credit for that?” Jones said. The administration’s enforcement mechanisms include withholding state grant funding from noncompliant communities. Jones filed an amendment that would exempt public safety grants from being withheld. “Even if you’re going to stick with this approach, there ought to be some things that are off the table,” Jones said. He recalled the wildfires that erupted across his district last fall, which he said towns like Middleton would not have been able to respond to without state grants for public safety services. In early March, Gov. Maura Healey said all grants were still at risk in towns that remained noncompliant.Duxbury Rep. Ken Sweezey — who has been vocal about protecting safety grants from being withheld — told the News Service that all five of his communities, two of which are noncompliant, received fire safety equipment grants in the latest round. “[The administration] awarded grants they previously said they wouldn’t,” Sweezey said. “[Housing and Livable Communities] said that for the time being, they saw that public safety grants, after the pushback last time, were important to honor.” The freshman Republican also filed a deadline-extension amendment that would halt “any regulation, directive, or requirement” relative to the MBTA Communities Act from taking place before December 31, 2026. Communities that did not meet prior deadlines must submit a district compliance application to the state by July 14, EOHLC said in January.“We’re in sort of an emergency situation where we’re going to be bumping up on this July 15 deadline. I have multiple communities that have filed exemptions,” Sweezey said. “This is really to let the legal process play out here so that the unfunded mandate cases, the class action cases can go through the legal process.”The post MBTA zoning law targeted by GOP budget amendments appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Multi-family-housing-is-built-on-S.-Main-Street-in-Attleboro-a-short-walk-from-the-commuter-rail-station-that-connects-the-citys-downtown-to-both-Boston-and-Providence.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Pending full board approval at its April 24 meeting, ISU Provost Jason Keith said what started as the Cyclone Civics Initiative will transform into the expanded ISU Center for Cyclone Civics, which will work with internal and external partners to improve civic literacy and skills across Iowa.
“The proposed center will work to promote civic education and free speech principles across campus, and will work with Iowa State University Extension and Outreach to share programming across the state as well,” Keith said.

In its current form as an initiative, Keith said Cyclone Civics has already started its work on campus, assessing civic knowledge among the student body and hosting a professional development conference for ISU staff and faculty. With the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence coming up in 2026, Keith said the initiative is planning a year’s worth of programming, including guest lectures.
The new center would have a home in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, according to the center proposal, and be staffed with a part-time director and one part-time staff member, with one of their responsibilities being the oversight of interns.
ISU has allocated $250,000 to the center annually over the next five years, according to the proposal, and will seek $122,000 each year from grants, donations and other sources.
“I would highlight that having a board-approved center will be helpful in attracting external funding from foundations and individual donors to support our efforts,” Keith said.
The University of Northern Iowa received approval for its own civic education center in September, following the ninth of 10 directives approved by the board in November 2023 on diversity, equity and inclusion programming. The directive stated universities must “explore a proposal, including cost, to establish a widespread initiative that includes opportunities for education and research on free speech and civic education.”
Iowa lawmakers have passed legislation to require the University of Iowa to establish its own “center for intellectual freedom,” which would include education and programming on civic education and civil discourse. The bill awaits Gov. Kim Reynolds’ signature.
Keith said there have been discussions about future collaboration among the three centers as well as other centers named in the proposal, including the Culver Public Policy Center at Simpson College and Ron and Jane Olson Institute for Public Democracy at Drake University.
Regent Christine Hensley said she’d like to see information from ISU about how people can donate to the center and if there could be incentives like naming opportunities for certain donation amounts, as it could help in fundraising efforts.
“I’m really excited about this program and appreciate all the work and effort that’s gone into it,” Hensley said.

“A proud Detroiter, graduate of Harvard Law, and active member of the legal community with both trial and appellate court experience, he will bring important perspectives to the highest court in our state. I want to thank him for his many years of public service and look forward to many more on the Supreme Court,” Whitmer said in a press release.
Hood, who currently serves on the Michigan Court of Appeals, First District, will take the seat left vacant after  the resignation of former Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement. Clement is now president of the Virginia-based National Center for State Courts, a nonprofit that provides assistance and resources to courts both nationally and around the world. She was replaced as chief justice by Megan Cavanagh.
Whitmer first appointed Hood to the bench in 2019 at the Third Circuit Court and then again to the Court of Appeals in 2022. Hood also served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan.
“I have had the distinct honor of serving the people of the state of Michigan for the past six years,” said Hood in a statement released by Whitmer’s office.  “I am deeply grateful to our Governor for her decision to appoint me to serve on our Supreme Court. I am also grateful for what it represents. For as long as I serve, the people will always be able to count on me for even-handed justice.” 
  Judge Noah Hood | Official portrait
Although state Supreme Court candidates appear on the nonpartisan section of the ballot, state parties nominate candidates to run for the position. 
Clement was appointed by former Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, in November 2017 and ran for a full eight-year term after being nominated by Republicans in 2018. 
Her departure, and Hood’s appointment by Whitmer, a Democrat, shifts the court from a 5-2 Democratic-nominated majority to a 6-1 majority, with Justice Brian Zahra as the lone Republican-nominated jurist on the court. His term runs through 2030, at which point he will be 70 and ineligible to run again.
Whitmer also announced the appointment of Judge Mariam Bazzi to succeed Hood on the Michigan Court of Appeals, First District; Christopher Trebilcock to the Michigan Court of Appeals, Second District; and Daniel Korobkin to the Michigan Court of Appeals, Third District. 
“These Michiganders all bring years of legal experience to their roles, and I am confident they will uphold the rule of law and serve the people admirably,” Whitmer said.

“Last year, we had a federal government that joined us in the fight for climate action. They worked hard to protect our air and land and water, and made historic investments in our clean energy effort,” Whitmer said. 
“Now we have a government that calls climate change a hoax and wants to repeal clean energy investments, slow growth and they’re skirting legal processes to cut hundreds of policies that help protect our air, land and lakes from pollution, waste and dangerous chemicals,” Whitmer said before pointing to an executive order that she said targets states who have passed laws to address climate change.
However, Michigan is not backing down in its climate efforts, Whitmer said, noting that Michigan is also seeing increased opportunities in clean energy jobs and electric vehicle manufacturing. 
“We have an opportunity to take the lead on climate, an opportunity to continue creating good paying jobs and an opportunity to show the world what Michigan can do,” she said.

As states serve as laboratories for democracy within our federal system, those states are on the frontline in the fight against climate change, Whitmer said, pledging not to abandon the goals outlined in her MI Healthy Climate plan.  
In that vein, Whitmer announced the launch of a statewide home energy rebate program in hopes of saving Michiganders costs on their energy bills. 
According to a statement from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, up to 15,000 homes will benefit from the program’s rollout, as households are eligible for up to $34,000 in rebates from the program’s two efforts. 
The first offers rebates to address the up front cost of whole-home energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation, air sealing and heating and cooling. Households are eligible for up to $20,000 in rebates through this program. 
The second will help reduce the upfront cost of energy efficient electric appliances and equipment, offering up to $840 for an electric stove or dryer; $1,750 for a heat pump water heater; $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation; $2,500 for electric wiring upgrades and $8,000 for a heat pump for heating or cooling, with households eligible for a maximum of $14,000 in rebates. 
Renters and homeowners interested in the program can find more information about the program and how to apply at Michigan.gov/HomeEnergyRebates or by dialing the CLEAResult Call Center at 855-510-7080.
When a household’s application is approved, they will be directed to select an program-approved contractor to conduct a home assessment with eligible rebate work to be completed by the program’s contractors. For low-income households, 100% of the work is covered. 
The program also aims to support jobs in construction; heating, ventilation and air conditioning; energy efficiency and appliance installation. The state is encouraging contractors to sign up online to become an eligible program contractor, directing any questions to mihercontractor@wmenergy.com. Contractors can also receive bonuses for certain projects in eligible communities.

Alex Andrade, a Republican representing parts of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, speaks to reporters on April 9, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The 2025 legislative regular session is drawing to an end, but the House’s investigation into a $10 million “donation” from health care giant Centene to the Hope Florida Foundation shows no signs of slowing down.
The $10 million infusion into the foundation, part of a larger Medicaid settlement with the giant managed care plan, and how the money found its way to political committees dedicated to defeating Amendment 3 to legalize cannabis in Florida, has eclipsed most other issues being debated in the halls of the Capitol this year. 
The lengthy committee meetings, which have left House Health Care Budget Chairman Alex Andrade “flabbergasted,” have become must-watch viewing, even for those with no interest in health care.
While other legislative panels have concluded their meetings for the session, the subcommittee is scheduled to meet twice this week — a four-hour meeting on Thursday and another early Friday morning.
Andrade has requested Mark Wilson, chair of Secure Florida’s Future; Amy Ronshausen, executive director of Save Our Society From Drugs; and Tallahassee attorney and Hope Florida Foundation legal counsel Jeff Aaron to testify during Thursday’s meeting. Aaron has said he has a prior engagement and won’t be able to attend.
The House hasn’t published an agenda for Friday’s meeting.
In addition to asking the trio to testify, Andrade sent out letters to six people, including Wilson and Ronshausen, requesting financial documents, correspondence, and other information.
Wilson, Ronshausen, and Florida Hope Foundation President Josh Hay were asked to provide the committee with all documents, memos, emails, correspondence, and text messages, grant applications and awards, and correspondence with James Uthmeier, Jeff Aaron, and Mohammad Jazil.
James Uthmeier is DeSantis’s former chief of staff, who helped steer the agreement, Andrade says, and also headed the governor’s anti-pot efforts; most of the $10 million appears to have been steered to DeSantis’ campaign against last year’s marijuana legalization citizens’ initiative. 
Uthmeier has subsequently been appointed by DeSantis as state attorney general. He has contended that he done nothing wrong and that he was not involved in the settlement.
Aaron and Jazil are Republican private attorneys who have worked closely with the DeSantis administration over the last several years on legal actions.

The letter sent to Jason Weida, DeSantis’s sitting chief of staff, requests “any and all documents, memos, emails, correspondence, call logs, and text messages” related to Hope Florida Foundation by any current or former employee, including Uthmeier, involving any of the following: Secure Florida’s Future, Mark Wilson, Frank Walker, Save Our Society from Drugs, Amy Ronshausen, Agency for Health Care Administration, Jeff Aaron, Mohammed Jazil, and Josh Hay.
Andrade sent AHCA Secretary Shevaun Harris a letter requesting her agency provide emails, memos, and text messages related to the resolution of the Centene payment, including any alternative settlement agreements.
Don Gaetz: Senate won’t confirm two of DeSantis’s top health care secretaries

Andrade, an attorney, requested AHCA provide the House all draft versions of the settlement agreement prior to the final agreement, that were produced or distributed for review and shared among any parties related to the settlement.
Everyone was asked to provide the information to the committee by April 25.
The Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times obtained a copy of an early iteration of the settlement agreement between Centene and the state that confirms the $10 million “donation” Centene made to the Hope Florida Foundation represented the return of taxpayer dollars stemming from Medicaid overpayments.
DeSantis says House Republicans are running a ‘smear’ campaign against him, First Lady

DeSantis administration officials have told the House that the money wasn’t taxpayer dollars.
Moreover, the governor has said the accusations of wrongdoing at Hope Florida are partisan in nature as First Lady Casey DeSantis is mulling a potential gubernatorial run to replace her husband, who is hitting his term limits.

Within minutes of each other, House Bill 231 passed in the Senate, and Senate Bill 542 passed in the House.
Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said many options have been flying around the Capitol, and SB 542 melds together ideas from other bills into one that isn’t perfect, but needs to pass.
“We want to get something across for our constituents, and we want to be able to say that this legislature at least took a stab at lowering property taxes,” Ler said.“Is this bill going to do everything … that everybody in this room wants it to do? No. Does it do everything I wanted to do? No. But what it does do is it actually makes a difference in property taxes.”
SB 542 includes a tiered rate drop and a one-time rebate among other provisions.
Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said she had concerns about the bill, but it’s “past time” to do something for residential property taxpayers, more than just a rebate.
“People will notice this,” Sullivan said. “Our constituents will open their bill, and they will say thank you. You guys dropped some rates for us.”
HB 231 is a 43-page property tax bill so complicated Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvary quipped on Tuesday that “nobody really knows what this bill is doing besides three, or four, or five us in the room.”
The bill has gone through months of amendments, including two more added on the floor Tuesday that addressed an issue with taxation limits in the Billings and Sunburst city charters that has complicated property tax discussions. 
House Bill 231 looks to shift property taxes onto second homes, but has met resistance from some legislators who live in districts with large numbers of second homes and short-term rentals.
Both bills still need a final vote in their respective chambers, and as both have been heavily amended, they will need to get another approval from their original chamber to pass.
How legislators choose to push either or both forward to the governor’s desk will unfold in the last days of the session.
Reducing property taxes for residential payers has been a priority for the 2025 Montana Legislature because bills have increased significantly — more than 20% on average in the state in the most recent 2023 reappraisal, and are expected to increase again.
  House debates ‘Frankenstein’ bill, worries about lack of current fiscal analysis

Ler said SB 542 takes pieces from other bills, including a major proposal from Democrats, House Bill 155, and marries them into “what the media now calls ‘the Frankenstein property tax bill.’”
It also takes pieces from HB 231, a proposal supported by the Governor’s Office,.
Rep. Llew Jones, R-Conrad, said residential property tax bills will decrease 14.5% statewide in the first year, and those payers also will receive a one-time $400 rebate.
Also in the first year, Jones said commercial properties will rise 4.6%, centrally assessed properties, such as railroads, will increase 10.7%, and agriculture will be up 4.3%.
In year two, he said, bills for residential homes would be down 25.6% on average.
After killing all but one amendment in a debate that ran nearly an hour-and-a-half, the House approved the bill on a bipartisan 80-20 vote.
The only amendment that passed was proposed by Rep. Katie Zolnikov, R-Billings.
Legislators have said the bill could cost the city of Billings millions because of an apparent conflict with its charter, which caps mills levied without voter approval.
 Zolnikov said if the city of Billings gets in legal trouble as a result, the amendment requires the state to pay any legal fees.
“I don’t think anybody’s intent is to, you know, bankrupt the city of Billings,” Zolnikov said.
Ler said the bill already protected the city of Billings and its unique situation, but the amendment was friendly. It passed with 99 votes and none opposed.
After the House passed the bill, though, a fierce debate followed over whether to send it to the Appropriations Committee, which reviews significant spending proposals.
Some legislators argued the House shouldn’t take shortcuts, especially because lawmakers didn’t have a current analysis of the bill’s cost. 
Rep. Zooey Zephyr, D-Missoula, said legislators need to work quickly, but they need to complete all their work too.
“This is the process. We shouldn’t skirt the process just because we waited until day 79 to pass property taxes,” Zephyr said.
Rep. Bill Mercer, R-Billings, said it was a weighty piece of legislation, and he wanted to know who the losers were before he voted.
He said he didn’t believe all of them had been identified, nor did he want to vote on legislation without a current fiscal analysis.
“I am not wild about voting on this without a new fiscal note,” said Mercer, who voted no on the bill.
However, Jones, chairperson of the Appropriations Committee, said the committee already had seen the bills that are part of SB 542, so the committee had a good handle on cost, and time was of the essence.
“I want to make sure that a tax bill crosses into the Senate before the Senate goes home,” Jones said.
The House agreed to bypass the review in the Appropriations Committee.
 Senate debates, worries about impacts on non-residential payers

HB 231 “picks winners and losers,” Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, said on the floor Tuesday.
HB 231 includes a property tax rebate on taxes paid in 2024. Someone who applied for the rebate also automatically qualifies for the homestead exemption built into the bill, a major piece of policy the governor has pushed.
The bill passed on a narrow 26-24 vote, with a single Democrat in opposition and nine Republicans in support. 
Glimm’s comments echoed the sentiments expressed by Sen. Greg Hertz, R-Polson, and Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell. 
Hertz, Glimm and Reiger have all been in support of Senate Bill 90, which directs tourist dollars toward property tax rebates as part of their property tax solution. But they didn’t support HB 231.
In the final comment before bill carrier Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, closed on HB 231, Regier explained his reason — first to the legislature, and then to the people of Montana.
He noted to the legislature it was spending general fund money, which has been a common discussion point in the chamber. And then, saying he was speaking directly to the public, he said tax rates, especially for agricultural communities, were going to go up if House Bill 231 passed.
For second home properties and short term rentals, that increase could be over $300 million, according to a fiscal note for HB 231.
“There are a lot of options that actually do provide property tax relief,” Regier said. “This is not it. So please, watch this vote, and hold those that vote for and against accountable.”
Fern, though, said the bill would provide middle-class property tax relief, saying that “for most folks, it will be a substantial tax decrease.”
He also pushed back on the idea second homes were a major issue, saying that when he knocked on doors during his campaign, “I’m going to guess 98% of them didn’t have second homes.”
However, Fern added HB 542 may end up being the vehicle for property tax relief and pointed to the urgency.
“Over the last couple sessions, we, the legislature and the Governor’s Office failed to deliver property taxes, and so it compounded,” Fern said on the floor. “Then we had a very volatile situation where appraisals and values went high. The system was not built to mitigate it in an easy way.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1154736495-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 15:08:13.481842

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Attorney General Matt Platkin sued 10 of New Jersey’s largest landlords and RealPage Inc., a property management software company, accusing them of colluding to raise rents in violation of state and federal antitrust and consumer protection laws.
In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Platkin said the alleged scheme forced tens of thousands of apartment renters to overpay and contributed to the state’s shortage of affordable housing.
“The skyrocketing rental prices that we’re experiencing in New Jersey are not the result of mere competition or mysterious market forces. What we are seeing and what so many hard-working New Jerseyans are experiencing is the result of deliberate market manipulation. So today, we filed a lawsuit to stop it,” Platkin said during a midday briefing with reporters in Newark.
The action comes two years after Accountable.US, a D.C.-based watchdog nonprofit, released a report exposing “housing profiteering.” The group urged officials in several states, including Platkin, to act on the issue in 2023 and again last year. Platkin did not mention the report or call to action Wednesday.
He said RealPage and the landlords set apartment rents based on RealPage’s algorithmic pricing software and aligned their prices to avoid competition that otherwise would have checked runaway rents. In so doing, Platkin said, they violated the federal Sherman Act, the New Jersey Antitrust Act, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act.
Named as defendants are: RealPage; Morgan Properties Management Company; AvalonBay Communities Inc.; Kamson Corporation; LeFrak Estates and its subsidiary Realty Operations Group; Greystar Management Services; Aion Management; Cammeby’s Management Company of New Jersey; Veris Residential Inc.; Russo Property Management; and Bozzuto Management Company. Additional defendants may be added, as the investigation remains ongoing, Platkin’s office said.
Platkin accused the companies of “unconscionable business practices that deceive and mislead consumers into believing the rental prices that they charge are market rate.”
Instead, he said, the companies shared confidential, proprietary information and used RealPage’s “anticompetitive algorithm” to set rents, which ballooned prices.
“These defendants work together as a rent-setting cartel conspiring to make themselves richer by preying on the thousands of New Jerseyans just looking for a safe, affordable place to live,” Platkin said.
Platkin pointed to a Harvard University study last year that found that half of New Jersey renters are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent.
By suing, Platkin added, he wants to stop RealPage and landlords from “ripping off the people of New Jersey.” He’s asking a judge to appoint a corporate monitor, at the defendants’ expense, to carry out court remedies and ensure the alleged scheme does not continue.
“I’m not going to tolerate corporate greed that violates the law and hurts our residents,” he said. “Our lawsuit today is seeking to make RealPage both stop their illegal conduct and pay back their illegal profits.”
RealPage did not respond to a request for comment. Mike Semko, the company’s associate general counsel, told lawmakers last year that the claims made against RealPage are “patently, categorically false.” The Legislature is considering a bill that would bar landlords from using algorithmic software to set rent prices.
Caroline Ciccone, president of Accountable.US, welcomed the lawsuit.

“As everyday costs continue to rise for Americans, it’s critical that elected officials step up and tackle price-gougers like RealPage, whose algorithm is set up to allow corporate landlords to push rental rates to historic highs,” Ciccone said. “We applaud Attorney General Platkin for fighting for New Jersey renters and putting an end to this potentially illegal price-fixing scheme.”

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) The leader of LSU’s medical school in Shreveport has resigned after months of pressure from an LSU Board member. 
David Guzick, who has been chancellor of LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport since January 2023, sent a letter of resignation Wednesday to the system Board of Supervisors,  spokesman Todd Woodward confirmed to the Illuminator. 
His resignation follows months of speculation about his potential dismissal after LSU Board member Esperanza Moran called for his dismissal at a board meeting in September. Moran has not spoken publicly about why she supported ousting Guzick. 
Moran was at the State Capitol on Wednesday for LSU Day at the legislature. When a reporter approached for comment on Guzick’s exit, she waved her hand and walked away. 
News of Guzick’s departure comes the same day as confirmation that LSU Provost Roy Haggerty will leave his position at the flagship campus. They become the third and fourth high-level administrators to leave the university this year. Kimberly Lewis, executive vice president for finance and chief administrative officer, announced in February she would step down. LSU’s top attorney, Winston DeCuir, relinquished his general counsel role in January, though he will remain a faculty member at its law school until.
Guzick had wide support from LSU leadership, including LSU System President William Tate and his top staff at the Shreveport campus. He was praised  for getting the medical school removed from probation by its accrediting body. 
That accomplishment was described as a “grand slam home run in the bottom of the 9th to win” by his top staffers in a letter they sent to Tate in March, urging his support for Guzick. A similar letter was sent by 17 department chairs to the LSU Board of Supervisors last month, when the LSU Health Shreveport Faculty Senate approved a resolution in support of Guzick. 
The Illuminator asked Tate, who was also at the Capitol Wednesday, why Guzick resigned.  
“Who?” answered Tate, who did not respond to further questions.

Or should they draft some protection?,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/23/saints-nfl-draft-archie-manning/,"Column: Should the Saints take a QB in the first round of the NFL Draft for the first time since Archie Manning, or should they go another route?","Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart throws the ball during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Kentucky on Saturday, Sept. 28, 2024, in Oxford, Miss. Kentucky won 20-17. (AP Photo/Randy J. Williams)
If the New Orleans Saints choose Jaxson Dart with the ninth pick of the NFL Draft Thursday night, it would not be the first time the Saints have chosen a Rebel quarterback in the first round.
Surely, most readers already knew that, and we’ll get to the other time that happened later in this missive. But first, should the Saints take Dart? For that matter, should they use that first round pick for any quarterback? Or should they use that early pick to bolster another position where they need immediate help? After all, there are so many places they need help.

Rick Cleveland
Me? I would take an offensive tackle or an edge rusher. Among the Saints’ many, many other needs, those are the most critical. Nearly every draft expert will tell you the 2025 draft is much richer in both edge rushers and those who block the edge than it is quarterbacks. You also can make the case that there’s no good reason to draft a quarterback until you can surround him with adequate protection.
The Saints have so many needs they might best be served to trade that ninth pick for more choices. New coach Kellen Moore inherits the NFL’s oldest team. The Saints desperately need to get younger and better at any number of positions. It would make some sense to trade the ninth pick for a pick later in the first and perhaps a couple additional picks in the second and third rounds. Or, perhaps use that ninth pick for an offensive tackle and then use their second round pick, the 40th overall, to pick a possible quarterback of the future.
We shall see. Interestingly, Dart is not even the highest Ole Miss player on most experts’ draft board. Both defensive tackle Walter Nolen and edge rusher Princely Umanmielen are rated above Dart when it comes to best available player no matter their position. I thought Nolen was hands down the best college football player – and the best potential pro – in Mississippi last season. If opponents did not double-team Nolen, he disrupted most everything they tried.
This year’s draft, which will take place in Green Bay over three days beginning Thursday night, will be in stark contrast to 1971, the first and only time the Saints drafted an Ole Miss quarterback in the first round. National TV cameras will focus on the highly choreographed first-round proceedings Thursday night. Most of the expected early picks will be present. A huge crowd will cheer and jeer the picks in person.
Back in ’71, Archie Manning nearly forgot there was a draft. Back then, the draft was held in January. None of the expected early choices were present. There was no TV broadcast and certainly no in-person crowd.
Manning, who had just married and honeymooned in Acapulco, was in Oxford, still attending Ole Miss classes. The draft, which lasted 17 rounds, began on a Monday morning. On Sunday afternoon, Manning received a call from the late, great Ole Miss sports information director Billy Gates. I’ll retell the story the way Archie told it to me.
Gates asked Archie if he remembered that the draft would begin on Monday morning.
“I guess I forgot,” Manning replied.
Gates reminded him that the Boston Patriots were picking first, the Saints second and the Houston Oilers third. “All three have called wanting to know where you will be. I’m pretty sure one of those three teams are going to pick you,” Gates told him. “Why don’t you come to my office tomorrow morning at 9, and I’ll let them all know you will be here.”
Archie said he would be there and that’s where he was when he heard the Patriots had taken Jim Plunkett, the 1970 Heisman Trophy winner out of Stanford, with the first pick of the draft. Moments later, Gates’ phone rang again. He answered, and then handed the phone to Manning.

John Mecom, the Saints’ owner, was on the line to tell him he was a Saint. 
“I talked to Mecom for two minutes, then Mecom put general manager Vic Schwenk on the line and we talked, and then I talked to J.D. Roberts, the head coach, for a couple minutes more. I remember there was a photographer there from the Associated Press to take pictures. The whole thing lasted 15 minutes.”
And that was that. 
“I made it on time to my 10 o’clock class,” Manning said.
He learned when he got home from class that nobody had taken Michigan All-American offensive tackle Dan Dierdorf, whom Manning had befriended at the Hula Bowl, in the first round. 
“I was excited because I thought we were going to get Dan and I knew how good he was,” Manning said.
He knew – or at least he thought he knew – his blind side would be protected. And then came the news that with their second pick of the draft, the Saints had chosen Grambling offensive lineman Sam Holden.
Dierdorf, picked by the St. Louis Cardinals later in the second round, became a five-time All-Pro, one of the best-ever offensive tackles in NFL history. Holden, a New Orleans native, lasted one year and never started for the Saints.
There’s a lesson there for the current Saints. If you are going to pick an offensive tackle first, at least pick one who can play. And if you do choose Dart, please, please find him some protection.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190426/AP24272780499346-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Alan Weets of Mechanicsville is suing the Chicago-based company Nordex USA, which does business as Acciona Windpower North America and Anchor Wind, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Weets alleges that in 2010, he entered into an agreement with Acciona that gave the company an easement on his property for the installation of two wind turbines. Acciona, the lawsuit claims, was aware of “serious problems” with the turbines that it installed on Weets’ property but failed to repair or replace them in order to render them safe.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In March 2023, one of the turbines caught fire and spread debris across 160 acres of Weets’ land, the lawsuit alleges. The damage allegedly resulted in Weets having to restrict that section of the property to grain production rather than forage and fodder for livestock feed.
In May 2024, a second turbine on Weets’ property allegedly caught fire, spreading additional debris across the land. Over the next several months, according to the lawsuit, Weets grew frustrated with a perceived lack of progress by Acciona contractors, who used farm-type equipment in an effort to clean up the property.
“The crews created additional debris-damage issues arising from further destruction of plastics and fiberglass pieces, making pieces that were smaller and more difficult to pick up from the foil,” the lawsuit alleges.
In August 2024, the second wind turbine allegedly caught fire again, causing one of the massive blades to fall to the ground. Weets claims that shortly thereafter, the Cedar County Co-Operative informed him it would not accept any grain from him that was contaminated by turbine debris. In all, 230 acres of land were allegedly contaminated by the debris.
Weets alleges that although he and Acciona never agreed on the cost or extent of the damages, the company issued him a check for $230,000 as compensation. The two sides have yet to come to terms on that issue, the lawsuit claims.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged negligence, breach of contract and consumer fraud. Nordex media representatives did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment.
A 2014 study by Imperial College London, the University of Edinburgh and SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden found that fires in wind turbines were occurring 10 times more often than were reported. At that time, the wind-power industry was reporting about 11 fires per year, while researchers determined that there were closer to 117 such fires annually among the 200,000 turbines examined.
In 2023, a report from the Caithness Windfarm Information Forum identified 3,287 reported wind-turbine accidents, worldwide, between 2000 to March 2023 — an average of 143 accidents per year. Fires accounted for 14% of those accidents, just behind blade failure, which accounted for 15% of the accidents.
The most common cause of wind turbine fires is a lightning strike, although mechanical and electrical failures are also contributing factors.

Larry Rhoden is appointing a new economic development commissioner and moving the current commissioner into a deputy role.
Joe Fiala, the current commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, will become the deputy commissioner less than a year after he was appointed to the position. He’ll be replaced in the top job by former state Secretary of Agriculture Bill Even, the Governor’s Office announced Wednesday.
The department is charged with recruiting, retaining and expanding business within South Dakota, including funding business projects in the state and incentivizing out-of-state businesses to relocate.
“Bill Even is the right leader to continue driving our economy forward,” Rhoden said in a news release. He added that he is “grateful for Joe’s continued service” and said Fiala has been “crucial to GOED for years, and he will be an important partner to Bill in the future.”

Former Gov. Kristi Noem appointed Fiala to the position last year when it had been open for six months, after then-Commissioner Chris Schilken stepped down to serve as deputy commissioner. Schilken is no longer part of GOED leadership, according to the website. Fiala will take the deputy commissioner job vacated by Jesse Fonkert, who was recently named president and CEO of South Dakota Trade.
Even served as South Dakota’s secretary of agriculture from 2007 to 2010. He left to work for DuPont Pioneer before joining the National Pork Board as CEO in 2016.
Before entering the private sector, he also served as deputy secretary of tourism and state development, director of GOED, director of state energy policy, and as a policy adviser for the Mike Rounds administration.
Even has agricultural degrees from South Dakota State University and Lake Area Technical College, as well as a law degree from Drake University.
He lives in Tea with his wife and three children. He’s a co-owner of Even Farms in Humboldt, a fifth-generation crop and livestock operation homesteaded by his great-grandfather in 1884. His ancestors sought out South Dakota for “new opportunities, room to grow and to raise a family,” he said in the news release. 
“I believe that pioneering spirit still exists in America and in South Dakota,” Even said. “I look forward to working with people who share that optimistic mindset and vision of making a life and a living in our great state.”

The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program, further delaying an effort that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years.
States will have an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access to underserved areas across the country.
The extension comes as the Trump administration prepares to make changes to the BEAD program, according to a notice from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The department is currently reviewing the program “to remove unnecessary rules and mandates, to improve efficiency, take a more technology-neutral approach, cut unnecessary red tape, and streamline deployment,” the notice said.
The $42.45 billion program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, began falling behind schedule in part because of inadequate federal mapping of where broadband is most needed and a lengthy challenge process to the maps. As a result, the slow-moving program has some local officials and experts questioning its efficiency.
Already-lagging broadband program faces more uncertainty under Trump

They anticipate that federal officials might change an affordability requirement, which mandates states include a low-cost service option for low-income households, or the type of technologies given preference under the program. That shift likely would be away from fiber-optic internet toward satellites or other technology.
Earlier this month, more than 100 state lawmakers from 28 states sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick requesting that any changes to the BEAD program be optional rather than mandatory. They argued that mandatory changes could undo their BEAD plans and delay broadband deployment by a year or more.
The BEAD program originally had required states to submit their final proposals to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within a year of their initial plan’s approval. Citing “extraordinary circumstances,” however — the new federal review — deadlines for states’ final proposals will be moved, according to the notice.
NTIA declined to comment for this story.
All 50 states have had their initial BEAD proposals approved, unlocking a portion — often 20% — of the money the feds will provide. As of April 14, Delaware, Louisiana and Nevada are the only states to have submitted their final proposals for public comment, according to the NTIA’s BEAD Progress Dashboard.

(Photo illustration via Getty Images)The Iowa Senate sent a bill to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk Wednesday that would set a deadline for tuition approval and implement new types of degree programs.
Titled the “College Affordability Act,” House File 440 would require the Iowa Board of Regents set tuition for state universities in the upcoming academic year by April 30 and conduct a study into the potential of freezing a student’s tuition in their first undergraduate year, making it so it won’t increase over the next three years.
State universities would also need to create at least one three-year bachelor’s degree program and work study program for employers to pay a student’s tuition while they are employed with them under the legislation.
The bill passed with unanimous support but some lingering concerns over the Legislature’s role in university finances.

Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, noted the Iowa Board of Regents is considering potential tuition increases for the 2025-2026 academic year this week during its April meeting, but the Legislature has yet to provide them with information on what money they’ll see from the state in the future.
Quirmbach said he supports the bill and hopes it can serve as a “shove” to get the Legislature to determine state appropriations for public higher education earlier than this year and in the past. When referencing three-year degree programs, he said there are things the Legislature can do at the K-12 level to help students complete their degree faster, like providing more funding for schools.
“If, by setting this date for the board to act, it can tweak the conscience of the majority party to get their own act together, then this would be useful,” Quirmbach said. “I can only hope that that proves to be the case.”
As state allocations have decreased to the point where anywhere from 60-70% of their budget is made up by tuition, Quirmbach said the universities and board are having to “take a guess” at how much tuition they’ll need to pay their bills.
“Everyone has to imagine that over time, if this Legislature continues to dawdle in approving education appropriations, that the board of regents is going to have to set higher tuitions than they otherwise generally would in order to cover their uncertainty,” Quirmbach said.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, floor manager of the bill, said there are a lot of areas lawmakers need to pay attention to related to this bill, including tuition increases. He added he looks forward to the board’s study into tuition freezes, which is supposed to be completed and provided to the General Assembly by the end of this year.
“This issue is more than just their request,” Green said. “Last year, we gave them $3 million less than their requests, and yet they generated about $35 million more from tuition. So there is a lot that needs to be studied here.”

An Oklahoma game warden speaks with hunters. (Provided photo)OKLAHOMA CITY — Lawmakers advanced two bills this week designed to tighten the state’s hunting regulations on Oklahoma public lands by instituting new requirements for guides and nonresidents. 
Senate Bill 448 heads to the governor’s desk after passing off the House floor with a nearly unanimous vote while Senate Bill 208 heads to the House floor moving through a committee Wednesday. 
The first, authored by Rep. Jim Grego, R-Wilburton, would require nonresidents to schedule and obtain written permission before hunting at any refuge or wildlife management area operated by the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Commission. 
A lottery system would be used, if necessary, to distribute permits to nonresidents to hunt. These permits would come at a cost of $100 and the lottery would be used to help ease overcrowding on public lands, Grego said. 
Micah Holmes, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, said the agency supports the bill because it offers another tool to deal with overcrowding. 
The agency fields complaints of overcrowding on more “popular” publicly managed lands, he said. 
Holmes said “this is a good problem to have,” and it speaks to the “excellent” land management done by the department. 
The agency is also looking into other options to monitor how many people are utilizing public lands, including electronic check-ins and road counters, he said. 
Senate Bill 208, authored by Rep. Ty Burns, R-Pawnee, would require the Wildlife Department to create a licensing and registration system for anyone providing “guiding services” on public lands. Guides are trained professionals who help hunters locate game, navigate terrain and provide other services.
The bill excludes “commercial hunting facilities” and landowners that offer those services on private or leased property. 
The measure does not outline any fees or guidelines for implementation, but allows the department to create any rules necessary to carry out the legislation. 
Rep. Nick Archer, R-Elk City, who voted against it, said he’s concerned that the bill’s language provided no enforcement authority to require these licenses and registration.
This measure is eligible to be heard on the House floor. If approved and not amended on the full chamber, it will head to Stitt’s desk.

Part of that effort was an unreported trip to the Super Bowl in New Orleans this year for House Speaker Jason White, his staff and a couple of their spouses. The trip was paid for, at least in part, by DraftKings, one of the nation’s highest-grossing gaming companies that has invested heavily in lobbying for legal online betting. 
Thanks to a loophole in Mississippi’s lax lobbying laws, there is no public report to date of the expensive weekend in lobbying reports that are supposed to document spending on behalf of state employees. The cheapest tickets to the Super Bowl retailed for nearly $3,000 each. The group attended the game less than a week after White oversaw the House’s approval of legislation to legalize mobile sports betting in Mississippi. 
The Republican speaker, one of the most powerful politicians in the state, has repeatedly said that legalizing mobile sports betting is one of his top priorities. He has continued to push for legal online betting after it has repeatedly died in the Senate. Proponents, such as White, say legalization would be a financial boon to the state. It would also further enrich the gambling companies that facilitate online betting.
The speaker and his staff enjoyed the Super Bowl weekend as mobile sports betting became one of the defining issues of the 2025 legislative session. White and the House leaders took the issue so seriously earlier this year that they blocked other legislation in response to the Senate’s opposition to legal sports betting, according to Senate leaders.
White and his spokesperson, who also attended the Super Bowl, refused to comment or answer questions about the Super Bowl trip.
While in New Orleans, White posed for a photograph in front of the Superdome with his wife, his taxpayer-funded security guard, two House staff members and the husband of one of his staffers. After Mississippi Today discovered the photo, DraftKings and John Morgan Hughes, whose Jackson-based Ten One Strategies firm lobbies for the Sports Betting Alliance, a group representing DraftKings and other gaming organizations, confirmed that the gambling industry paid for the game day tickets.
The Boston-based sports gambling giant has been at the forefront of a years-long lobbying push to legalize online betting in Mississippi and around the country. In a statement, a company spokesperson said DraftKings “follows the required reporting requirements in all jurisdictions, including Mississippi.” 
The company declined to answer how much it spent on the group and whether it paid for perks beyond the game tickets in New Orleans — where some of White’s entourage documented extravagant Super Bowl festivities on social media.




Super Bowl trip was ‘unforgettable experience’ 
Taylor Spillman, White’s communications director, and her husband, Trey Spillman, who serves as Rankin County’s prosecuting attorney, photographed their weekend in the Big Easy. 
They mingled in a luxury box suite at the Superdome, private spaces that cost between $750,000 and $2 million. They took photographs with celebrities such as former Today show host Hoda Kotb and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. And there were pregame drinks at what appeared to be Brennan’s, the famed New Orleans Creole restaurant that served as the weekend stomping ground for guests of DraftKings.   
A day after the Super Bowl, Trey Spillman took to social media to thank DraftKings for the experience. 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. Thank you @draftkings for the hospitality! #sports”
But after Mississippi Today asked the Spillmans this week about the trip, he edited the social media post to remove any mention of DraftKings and the company’s “hospitality.” 
“Unforgettable experience at Super Bowl LIX. #sports,” the edited post reads. 
The Spillmans did not respond to multiple messages seeking comment.

Online gambling money pours in to politicians
Mississippi Today asked DraftKings why the lobbyist registered to represent the company in Mississippi did not disclose the Super Bowl trip for the speaker’s family and staff in his most recent round of expenditure reports.
In response, a spokesperson for the company pointed to state lobbying law that gives the clients of lobbyists, in this case DraftKings, until the end of the year to document gifts to public officials. 
Mississippi’s lobbying laws do allow for a distinction between individual lobbyists and clients, leaving open to interpretation what lobbyists and their clients are required to report and when they’re required to report their expenses. The DraftKings spokesperson said that distinction allows it to wait until the end of the year to report the excursion for White’s group. This means DraftKings is claiming the company or the Sports Betting Alliance, not its lobbyist, funded the Super Bowl outing.
Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office regulates lobbyists in Mississippi and enforces the state’s lobbying laws. Watson, who has accepted $1,000 himself from a DraftKings-affiliated PAC, and his office publish an annual lobbying guide.
In the most recent guide, it says a lobbyist’s client is only required to file an annual report the following January — nearly nine months after the regular legislative session ends. That is the provision DraftKings cited when asked why its lobbyist did not document the Super Bowl trip on the most recent report. 
Elizabeth Jonson, a spokesperson for Watson’s office, told Mississippi Today in a statement that if a gambling company provided football tickets or other items of value to public officials “for the purpose of lobbying,” then the company is required to disclose those gifts, at some point, in their lobbying reports.  

The Spillmans pose for a photo with Hoda Kotb at the Super Bowl.
Unlike many other states, Mississippi has no “gift law” banning or limiting how much money lobbyists or others can spend on politicians or government officials.
In total, the Sports Betting Alliance, a group representing DraftKings and other gaming organizations, has spent approximately $454,000 since 2024 on lobbying fees and campaign donations to advocate for mobile sports betting, according to a review of campaign finance and lobbying reports.
Of that money, the Sports Betting Alliance has spent over $254,000 in Mississippi on lobbying expenses, ad campaigns and meals for lawmakers, according to lobbying records filed with the secretary of state.
The SBA and its employees have donated at least another $200,000 to Mississippi politicians, according to campaign finance reports since 2014. SBA routed the money through TenOne PAC, the PAC controlled by Hughes’ lobbying firm. Hughes and the firm have also contributed $32,500 of their own money to the PAC, which could have also been used for sports betting advocacy, although the PAC supports other causes as well.
Arkansas governor faced Super Bowl questions

Taylor Spillman, the speaker’s communications director, posed for a photo at the Super Bowl with Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
At the Super Bowl, Huckabee Sanders posed with White’s spokesperson, Taylor Spillman. A year prior, the Arkansas governor faced questions about who paid her tab for a trip to the Super Bowl. Sanders later clarified that she and her husband paid for their commercial flight, hotel and tickets to the game. Arkansas, unlike Mississippi, has laws requiring politicians to report gifts from special interests and imposes limits on them.
Sanders’ spokesperson said she paid her own way again to this year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans. 
In response to media reports about her trip to the 2024 Super Bowl, Arkansas officials acknowledged that Arkansas State Police provided security on the trip to Huckabee Sanders and her family.
White, the Mississippi speaker, also appears to have had state-funded security on his trip to this year’s Super Bowl.
One of the people photographed in New Orleans with White is the speaker’s designated security guard with the Department of Public Safety’s Executive Protection Division. When asked whether any state resources were used to send the guard to the Super Bowl with the speaker, Bailey Martin, a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety, said such state-funded protection would be “expected.”
“The speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives has been assigned an executive protection detail for many years,” Martin said in a written statement. “It would be expected for agents assigned to the speaker’s detail to attend such events when traveling out of state.”
Two other state employees who work closely with the speaker in the House were photographed inside the Superdome with the Spillmans. One is White’s administrative assistant, and the other is a House committee assistant. There were seven people, including the speaker, photographed in front of the Superdome. Those involved have not disclosed whether others joined the Mississippi group.
The average Super Bowl ticket price this year was around $4,708, according to the online ticket platform TickPick, but prices varied widely.

The feverish push to expand the lucrative mobile sports betting industry in states around the country traces back to a change in the federal legal landscape.  
Other legislation used as leverage for betting
Commercial sports betting was effectively banned, with a few exceptions, until 2018 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a 1992 prohibition. Sports gambling companies such as DraftKings then launched a full-court press lobbying campaign to bring sports betting to tens of millions of mobile phones around the country, an effort reported to be the fastest expansion of legalized gambling in American history.
Around 40 states have some form of legalized sports betting, though about 20 have full online betting with multiple operators, according to Action Network, a sports betting application and news site. Some states only have in-person betting, and some only have a single online operator in the state.
Mississippi has been one of the holdouts, largely due to fears that legalization could harm the bottom line of the state’s casinos and increase the prevalence of gambling addiction. Influential religious institutions in the Bible Belt state have also opposed the spread of gambling. 
Mississippi allows sports betting now, but only inside casinos.
After passing the House in 2023 and 2024, legislation legalizing online betting has died in the Senate. 
On Feb. 8, the day before the Super Bowl, White reminded his social media followers that Mississippi had attempted to legalize mobile sports betting for three years.
“We have now passed it again this year,” White wrote. “Your issue is on the other end of the Capitol.” 


This session, White and powerful House leaders took an unusually bare-knuckled approach in their push for mobile sports betting.
Democratic Sen. David Blount, the Senate Gaming chairman, has refused to advance mobile sports betting out of his committee. He said House leaders appeared to retaliate this year by killing at least four other gaming-related bills. 
One bill would have allowed the Mississippi Department of Human Services to collaborate with the state Gaming Commission to withhold cash winnings from people with outstanding child support, a sum totaling $1.7 billion. Federal data shows Mississippi has the worst child support collection rates in the nation and one of the highest rates of child poverty. 
Another bill would have changed the law dealing with leasing state-owned water bottoms on the Gulf Coast, an issue important to casinos. All of the stalled bills were supported by Republicans. 
“It certainly appears that the position of the House is, ‘We won’t pass any legislation related to gaming, even if it’s supported by a Republican statewide official or has the unanimous support of the Senate, the industry and regulators,’” Blount said. “None of that appears to be able to pass the House until they get mobile sports betting.” 
In a separate move, House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar attempted to increase taxes on Mississippi casinos, some of which have opposed mobile sports betting legalization. Lamar, one of White’s top lieutenants, made clear his casino tax increase proposal, which stood little chance of passing into law, was a political shot at the casino industry for the blockage of online betting. 
White also attempted to leverage other legislation, including the state income tax and the public retirement system, to coerce the Senate into passing mobile sports betting, Senate leaders said. 
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who leads the Senate, did not respond to a request for comment.  
Proponents of mobile sports betting in Mississippi say the state is losing between $40 million and $80 million a year in tax revenue by keeping mobile sports betting illegal. And sports gambling companies are losing out on a new customer base in Mississippi, which is home to a thriving illegal online gambling market. 
Days after House lawmakers made those arguments on the floor of the Mississippi House in Jackson, the speaker’s staffers were enjoying the hospitality of DraftKings at its Super Bowl weekend festivities.
“We view these things as DraftKings in real life,” said Shawn Henley, DraftKings’ chief customer officer, of the company’s Super Bowl weekend events. “We also have tons of business partners and will spend a lot of time with them.”
Mississippi lawmakers will convene in a special legislative session in the coming weeks to finalize a state budget, as they were unable to agree on one during their regular session. 
The governor has the power to set the agenda during a special session, and Gov. Tate Reeves has said he’s open to adding mobile sports betting legislation to the upcoming special session agenda.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/23112817/Main-Super-Bowl-art.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Sessions III issued his ruling Friday in U.S. District Court in Burlington ordering that Öztürk, who is Turkish and was in the United States on a student visa, be transferred back to a Vermont facility by May 1. The judge in that ruling also gave the parties in the case four days to seek an appeal of that order. On Tuesday night, the federal government filed its notice of appeal.The one-paragraph filing by acting U.S. Attorney of Vermont Michael Drescher, representing ICE and other federal agencies and officials in the case, stated the government was appealing to the 2nd U.S. Circuit of Court of Appeals in New York. Drescher also asked for a continued stay of federal court proceedings in Vermont while that appeal was pending.Drescher, in the filing for a stay, asked Sessions to rule on that motion no later than 3 p.m. Thursday, or he would be seeking “emergency relief” from the appeals court.  Sessions, in his order Friday, not only required the federal government to transfer Öztürk to a Vermont facility by May 1, but also set a bail hearing for May 9.Drescher’s appeal notice stated the federal government was challenging Sessions’ ruling regarding whether he had jurisdiction in the case as well as his order that Öztürk “be physically transferred to ICE custody within the District of Vermont no later than May 1, 2025.”Öztürk has been detained in an ICE detention facility in Louisiana since March 26. The doctoral student was taken into custody on a street not far from her apartment in Somerville Massachusetts, by masked officers in plainclothes. She eventually was held overnight in Vermont at a St. Albans immigration facility before being taken aboard a flight at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport and arriving at the Louisiana facility the next morning. Öztürk’s attorneys have argued that she appears to have been wrongly targeted in violation of her free speech rights by federal immigration officers. Öztürk had co-authored an op-ed in Tufts’ student newspaper last year that called on the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel and to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.” Drescher, reached Wednesday, declined comment on his notice of appeal and motion for a stay of further proceedings in Vermont.Attorneys for Öztürk could not immediately be reached Wednesday for comment. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal government appeals ruling ordering detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rumeyza-ozturk-4-20250414.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Photo by Shaun Griswold / Source NM)The parties in the long-running Yazzie-Martinez lawsuit over educational equity in New Mexico will meet in court next week to discuss a motion alleging the state has not complied with previous court orders, along with the plaintiffs’ request for a “remedial plan.”
The case, originally filed in 2014, led to a finding in 2018 by the late First Judicial District Court Judge Sarah Singleton, who found that the state was not providing equitable educational opportunities to Native students, English language learners, low-income students and students with disabilities. She ordered the state to take steps to address the needs of these at-risk students and ensure schools have the resources to provide them with the education they deserve.
Attorneys representing Louise Martinez and Wilhelmina Yazzie filed a joint motion of non-compliance in September 2024, arguing that the state has not made significant progress in addressing the needs of at-risk students. Specifically, in their motion, plaintiffs point to ongoing poor student performance; high turnover within the New Mexico Public Education Department; high teacher vacancy rates; and a lack of targeted funding for at-risk students.
Since Singleton’s decision, the state has increased funding for public education, but students are still being overlooked, Melissa Candelaria, education director for the NM Center on Law and Poverty, which represents the plaintiffs, told Source NM. 
The motion hearing is scheduled for 9 a.m. Tuesday, April 29. 
“We believe the court’s ruling should have been a wakeup call,” Candelaria said. “Our students can’t afford more bureaucratic churn and empty promises from PED. And we believe, the plaintiffs believe, the court must step in to enforce a real community-driven plan that reflects the urgency and the gravity to improve the overall state education system.”
Candelaria noted that the joint motion was not opposed by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, who represents the state in the case. Court documents state that Torrez “agrees” that there has been “insufficient compliance.” However, private counsel for the PED did oppose the motion, particularly the plaintiff’s proposed remedial plan. 
PED had not responded to a request from Source NM for comment prior to publication.
That plan, as detailed in court documents, includes nine components or goals, including: establishing a multicultural and multilingual educational framework; building an education workforce; increasing access to technology; developing methods of accountability; and strengthening the capacity of the PED. 
“There’s no longer a debate that a statewide education plan is necessary. Now, the decision is who leads that development,” Candelaria said. 
Candelaria also told Source the plaintiffs propose the Legislative Education Study Committee take the lead in developing the remedial plan because the department’s staff have knowledge and expertise in the area of education and have access to data. The department also has a director and permanent staff, as opposed to the PED, which has had multiple cabinet secretaries lead the department in the nearly seven years since Singleton’s decision, she noted.
“Without a plan, the efforts by the Legislature will still be piecemeal and scattershot and it’s not going to result in what we want to see in a transformed education system that’s equitable and that builds on the strengths and provides for the needs of the four student groups in the case,” Candelaria said. 
The PED opposes the motion on this point, according to court documents, and argues the education department should take the lead in developing the plan. The department also says more time is needed to create and then implement the plan. Plaintiffs suggest that the five-year plan should be developed within six months of this month’s hearing. 
Wilhelmina Yazzie, one of the original plaintiffs, told Source she feels “very optimistic” ahead of the motion hearing and that she hopes the judge agrees a plan is necessary. She added that the inequities in public education were emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“Especially our tribal communities who are really deeply impacted by that, and they still continue to suffer to the present time right now and just by the state not taking the action that we need them to take,” Yazzie said.
Yazzie’s son, Xavier Nez, 22, was in third grade when the lawsuit started. He is now in his third year studying at the University of New Mexico. Candelaria pointed out that since the 2018 court decision, multiple classes of students have made their way through the state’s educational system and failed to receive a comprehensive education. Yazzie’s youngest child, Kimimila Black Moon, is currently in third grade but attends private school. 
“She’s not in the public school because I still haven’t seen changes,” she said. 
Yazzie told Source that another goal of hers is to get out into communities throughout the state and speak with families because many parents are still unaware of the lawsuit and “they’re the ones that firsthand know what their children need, what they’re lacking, how they’re doing in school.”

(Photo courtesy of the Florida House of Representatives)The Florida House on Wednesday approved in a near-unanimous vote this year’s condominium bill, which Gov. Ron DeSantis has criticized as part of his feud with the chamber’s leadership.
With a little more than a week until the scheduled end of the session, House lawmakers approved Miami Republican Rep. Vicki Lopez’s bill, HB 913, which would allow condominium associations to open lines of credit instead of raising cash from owners to fund building repairs.
The legislation attempts to address escalating association fees following last year’s deadline for condominiums to complete studies detailing how much each needs to save to pay for roof and structural maintenance. Lawmakers passed legislation, requiring those studies and milestone inspections 30 years after the buildings’ construction, after the 2021 collapse in Surfside of a 12-story condo that killed 98 people.
“I did not come to the Florida House to become a housing expert, but here we find ourselves,” Lopez said Wednesday. “So, this affectionately known as the condo queen is prepared to continue to do the work to make sure that we have listened. I’m telling you, this is landmark legislation that finally does provide relief, the financial relief that all of our condo owners deserve.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe vote followed criticism from DeSantis, who in press conferences said that language allowing condo owners to vote electronically on matters brought by their associations would incite fraud. The version the House approved Wednesday requires 25% of condo owners who can vote to ask the association to hold an electronic voting option, which Lopez said is needed because a lot of owners live outside of the state or country.
“The House condo bill seems to be something that favors developers and puts the interest of developers over the interests of Florida residents,” DeSantis said during an April 10 press conference at the City of Sweetwater Community Center.
The only two votes against the bill came from DeSantis allies: Republican Reps. Michael Caruso of Delray Beach and Kiyan Michael of Jacksonville.
Multiple Democrats praised Lopez on the House floor, saying she took the time during the summer to meet with their constituents about the rising condominium fees burdening elderly people on fixed incomes.
The Senate is set to take up its proposal, from Fleming Island Republican Sen. Jenifer Bradley, SB 1742, on Thursday. There are still some key differences between the two proposals. For example, Bradley’s bill would allow condominium associations to invest their funds for repairs and to pause their contributions for reserve funds for repairs for up to two years after the milestone inspection.
However, one provision that intensified disagreement between the sponsors early on is no longer a part of the House bill. Lopez originally wanted to prohibit Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state’s property insurer of last resort, from issuing or renewing policies for condominium buildings that haven’t completed their building inspections.
“We want to make sure that associations comply, but I’m also very concerned about making sure that they don’t compound their troubles by not being able to secure insurance,” Bradley told Florida Phoenix in March.
Hardening pilot program
House lawmakers also voted unanimously to extend a pilot program for grants for condominiums to take on projects that would make buildings more resilient against hurricanes. HB 393, co-sponsored by Lopez and Parkland Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, lowers the requirement of 100% approval from condo owners to 75% for the association to apply for a grant.
However, the House is not adding additional funds for the pilot other than the $30 million appropriated last year, of which $29.6 million remains unspent because of the timeline of the application process.
The Senate bill, SB 592, has passed all of its committee stops but it has not been scheduled for a floor vote.

“These are Department of Attorney General warrants [being served] against multiple individuals in multiple jurisdictions, including Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Canton,” Danny Wimmer, spokesperson for the Michigan Attorney General’s Office, confirmed for the Michigan Advance.
While Wimmer would not disclose the nature of the warrants or specifically how many individuals were targeted, he did say that no arrest warrants were being executed, and that while people had been temporarily detained, there were no arrests.
However, the pro-Palestinian advocacy TAHRIR Coalition issued a release claiming that agents with the FBI, Michigan State Police, as well as officers with local police agencies arrived Wednesday morning in unmarked vehicles at the homes of University of Michigan pro-Palestine activists in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Canton.

“Law enforcement officers confiscated electronics, questioned, and detained two activists, who were later released from their Ann Arbor residence,’’ the group said in the release. Officers from the attorney general’s office, the Plymouth Police Department, and the FBl also obtained personal property from a Ypsilanti residence and detained four people who were later released, the coalition said. 
The coalition alleged officers refused to present warrants in Ypsilanti. A Facebook post by the Ypsilanti Police Department said they had been made aware that the FBI and Michigan State Police would be conducting a search warrant at a location on Summit Street.
“Immigration is not involved. YPD has been brought in to secure the scene, given that a crowd has assembled,” the post said.
Ann Arbor Police also posted to Facebook about the warrants, saying they were one “many agencies involved in a multi-jurisdictional investigation led by the Michigan Attorney General’s office [and] related to reported crimes committed in the City of Ann Arbor as well as other jurisdictions. This investigation is not related to immigration enforcement.”
Wimmer also said immigration agents were not involved.
“There was no ICE element present,” he said.
A total of 11 people are facing criminal charges from the AG’s office for defying law enforcement orders to vacate a pro-Palestinian encampment on the University of Michigan campus in May 2024 and then physically obstructing law enforcement officers as they worked to clear the area. However, Wimmer would not confirm if the warrants were related to the 11 people previously charged.

Kilton Webb of Durham joined other union workers at the State House on April 23, 2025 to call on Congress to protect the federal tax credits for energy development that have kept him and others living and working in Maine. (Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)When IBEW Local 567 member Kilton Webb started his career as an electrician in 2018, his first job was on a solar field in Kennebunk. 
The two years that Webb, who now represents Durham in the House of Representatives, spent traveling from town to town building dozens of solar farms as renewable energy projects proliferated allowed him to pay off debt, purchase a home and advance to a journeyman electrician. 
That’s why the Democrat joined other union workers at the State House Wednesday morning to call on Congress to protect the federal tax credits for energy development that have kept him and others living and working in Maine. Congressional Republicans are currently negotiating a federal spending plan that is expected to include significant cuts to pay for an extension of the 2017 tax cuts as well as bolstering funding for border security and defense.
“These clean energy tax credits — which have been in force now for more than two years — they are working,” said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council. 
“They are doing exactly what they are intended to do: lowering Mainers’ energy bills, investing in good-paying jobs right here at home and powering Maine with independent, homegrown energy. Win. Win. Win.”
Part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Investment and Production tax credits allow business and tax-exempt entities to deduct part of the cost of developing renewable energy systems from their federal taxes. They include labor requirements for the projects such as paying workers prevailing wages and hiring apprentices for a certain number of hours. 
Among Maine’s congressional delegation, Democratic Reps. Jared Golden and Chellie Pingree, as well as independent Sen. Angus King, voted in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. However, Republican Sen. Susan Collins voted against it. 
The tax credits are a “huge lever for driving clean energy and growing the pipeline of skilled tradespeople we so badly need,” Eanes said.
Hayley Lawrence, who lives in Augusta, said it would be a “mistake” to take away the tax credits that have helped create jobs for people like her. Prior to graduating from an apprenticeship program, Lawrence was living in her car. Just days after completing her program, she was able to get work on solar projects that allowed her to rent an apartment. 
While some energy development projects are only eligible for one of the credits, multiple solar and wind technologies, as well as municipal solid waste, geothermal, and tidal projects are eligible for both. 
The tax credits can offset development costs by up to 30%, which provides a “meaningful savings” that can be passed on to the utility and ultimately, ratepayers, Eanes explained. If those credits disappear for projects that are counting on them, developers may have to renegotiate contracts or pass cost increases onto ratepayers. 
Eanes and other labor leaders feared that Maine could be disproportionately hurt if the tax credits end because the rural state has significant untapped capacity for new projects that could utilize the benefit to develop homegrown energy and good jobs. 
There are 145 utility-scale projects either operating or in development across Maine that could be eligible for federal energy tax credits, according to information provided by the Maine Labor Climate Council. This includes the Lincoln Battery Storage Project, Northern Maine Renewables Program, County Line Wind Farm and more. 
Together, those projects support more than 9,100 jobs, $8.8 billion in investment and nearly 5,000 megawatts of power generation or storage, the council said. 
But, Eanes said, “they are depending on the certainty from Washington D.C. to keep these clean energy tax credits going.”

Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, making notes in the House Ways and Means General Fund Committee on April 1, 2025, in the Alabama State House in Montgomery, Alabama. The Alabama Senate Judiciary Committee hosted a public hearing Wednesday for his legislation regarding police immunity. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee hearing Wednesday on a bill that would enhance immunity protections for law enforcement drew critics who feared the consequences for their communities.
Speakers at the public hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee said they feared HB 202, sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, would allow law enforcement to act with impunity.
“This bill moves the needle to something that could be very dangerous,” said Gida Smith, a Montgomery resident. “A police state seems far away from us, but police states do not happen overnight. They happen in increments, you allow a little of this, you allow a little of that, you exempt people from prosecution, you exempt the president from prosecution.”
The legislation establishes a heightened standard that law enforcement can be held liable for misconduct while performing their duties, and allows them a procedural hearing to determine if their actions are within the scope of their duties before a case can move forward that alleges wrongdoing.
“Here for me is the core of the bill,” Reynolds, a retired Huntsville law enforcement officer, told the committee before the public hearing. “Law enforcement officers who use force constitutionally while carrying out their duties are immune from prosecution. Law enforcement officers are not immune for any unconstitutional use of force during any execution of duties. If it is unconstitutional, they have no coverage under this piece of legislation.”
Supporters of the legislation said it would align existing state statutes with case law.
“HB 202 is offered to amend certain laws, as you have already heard, that were last updated in 1979,” said Hoss Mack, executive director of the Alabama Sheriffs Association. “It defines the definitions of ‘use of force’ incidents involving law enforcement in line with current federal law and United States Supreme Court decisions. In amending these laws, it will also align what is already being taught in law enforcement academies across this state.”
But critics were not convinced. Travis Jackson, a Montgomery resident who spoke against the legislation when it was in the House, said the legislation will not allow officers to protect and serve the public.
“Law enforcement will have a jail-free card due to not getting held accountable for their criminal mischief,” he said.
The bill passed the House of Representatives in March despite unified opposition from Democrats and attempts to filibuster the legislation.
HB 202 would change the law so that officers would have immunity so long as they do not violate people’s rights in the U.S. or Alabama Constitution. Currently, law enforcement does not have immunity if they act “willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, in bad faith, beyond his or her authority, or under a mistaken interpretation of the law.”
It also provides law enforcement with a court hearing to determine if they acted within the scope of their authority. If the court rules they acted within their duties, then either the civil lawsuit or the criminal case is dismissed.
The bill also provides police officers and deputies with protection from having to provide evidence during discovery in civil cases, and it allows them to assert the same immunity claims that they acted within the scope of their authority during the incident of alleged wrongdoing.
Nearly all Democrats on the committee said they opposed the legislation.
“It is a green light for Black folks to get killed,” said Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham. “That is just the bottom line. It is a green light for Black folks to get killed, and the person has the opportunity to not be held accountable. It does that.”
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham had concerns about people with a disability, such as people who have lost their sight or hearing, who then have trouble complying with the law enforcement orders.
“Oftentimes, if a person does not understand that, and he is using his own discretion in a situation, it could turn deadly,” she said.
At least one Republican lawmaker on the committee supports the bill.
“I want to thank you for bringing this bill,” said Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore. “It is about time that we statutorily came to align with clarifying the roles and where those split-second decisions can be made.”
The committee did not vote on the legislation on Wednesday, but could do so next week.

House Bill 436, sponsored by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, cleared the House Committee on Civil Law and Procedure without objection. It would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving general damages stemming from auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering, but the proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages,” such as medical expenses and property damage.
Firment, an insurance consultant, said the purpose of his bill is to help address the state’s auto insurance crisis while discouraging illegal immigration. 
Rep. Nicholas Muscarello, R-Hammond, questioned the constitutionality of the legislation, pointing out the state could be meddling in federal immigration law. Muscarello practices civil law and is the lead criminal prosecutor for two municipalities in Tangipahoa Parish.
“The Supreme Court said that we can’t enforce alien laws. That would be a federal position,” Muscarello said. “So it might be something we could look at because there might be some constitutional issues.”
Firment said his bill, which moves next to the House floor, is very narrowly focused and believes it would pass constitutional scrutiny.

Contingency fee limits
Another proposal, House Bill 439, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, aims to limit the amount of money lawyers can make from lawsuits. It would limit contingency fees, the money a lawyer makes only if they win a case, to 10% on the first $15,000 in damages. Any amounts beyond that would not be regulated.  
While presenting his bill to the committee, Hebert revealed his personal motivation for the proposal. He said his daughter was involved in a minor accident that he said resulted in almost no property damage. According to Hebert, the other driver voiced no complaints on the scene and was uninjured, yet she sued his insurer a year later. The driver sought injury damages totaling $15,000, the minimum bodily injury coverage required for auto insurance policies in Louisiana.  
“Excuse my language, but I am pissed about this,” Hebert said.
Hebert, a real estate professional, said he tried to convince his insurer to fight the lawsuit, but ultimately it chose to pay $15,000 to settle the case.
Hebert said a limit on legal fees would discourage lawyers from pushing to get quick settlements from insurance companies, but his proposal raised concerns with some lawmakers. 
Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, who is a lawyer, said auto injury cases take more work than just mailing out demand letters to insurance companies. Personal injury attorneys have to interview witnesses, consult with doctors and schedule property damage adjusters, he said. 
Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, is also an attorney who handles auto accident claims. She said she doesn’t like the idea of the government fixing the prices of goods and services, though she ultimately voted in favor of Hebert’s bill. 
“My concern is this is an overstep with regards to free market economy,” Ventrella said.
The measure cleared the committee in a 10-2 vote along party lines with Larvadain and Rep. Sylvia Taylor, D-LaPlace, who is a retired judge, opposed the bill.
Proposed damages cap
The committee also gave its approval to a proposal that puts a ceiling on lawsuit damages in all personal injury cases, including auto accidents. 
House Bill 435, sponsored by Rep. Peter Egan, R-Covington, advanced in a 10-2 vote with the same two Democrats opposed. 
“I’m trying to lower rates in Louisiana,” said Egan, a health care company founder. “I don’t know if this is the bill that does it.”
Egan’s bill would cap general damage awards at $5 million, which Muscarello pointed out is already the maximum payout on commercial auto policies million in Louisiana. Insurance companies won’t pay any more than that regardless of how much a jury awards a plaintiff, he said. 
Lawmakers heard testimony in support of Egan’s bill from Mark Younger, who runs a produce farm in Addis. Younger said his farm was sued after one of his drivers was involved in a minor fender bender with no apparent injuries. His insurance costs became so high that he now uses an out-of-state trucking company, which Younger said pays lower insurance premiums, to deliver his products.  
“It’s like we’re hiring one wing of the mafia to protect us from another wing of the mafia – the Louisiana State Bar,” Younger said.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources intends to dredge 20,000 cubic yards of muck from the bed of McCook Lake this spring, a little less than a year after a devastating flood left the southeast South Dakota community in tatters.
The dredging is meant to begin in May, according to a project outline document on the agency’s public notice web portal.  
Homes and roads in McCook Lake area ravaged by flooding

The goal is “to restore recreation uses and eliminate hazards” created by floodwater deposits in the 273-acre Union County oxbow lake during historic flooding last June.
“All sediment and debris will be removed from the lake and deposited in an upland location away from waters of the state,” the dredging notice says.
The department will take public comment on the plan through April 27, and Secretary Hunter Roberts will consider giving the go-ahead for dredging.
Floodwaters inundated McCook Lake last June when state officials used a levee to divert floodwaters in its direction, setting in motion an emergency plan meant to spare the larger communities of North Sioux City and Dakota Dunes from more significant flooding. The state set up a levee for the same reason during a 2014 flood event, but McCook Lake residents didn’t take on water in that instance.
The department did not immediately respond Wednesday to questions on the price tag for the dredging.



How to comment
Written comments regarding the McCook Lake dredging proposal must be received on or before April 27.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Six days after the shootings at Florida State University, students marched approximately three miles from campus to the Capitol Wednesday morning to demand state lawmakers  do more to protect them and the rest of the state from gun violence.
The episode in Tallahassee last Thursday ended in two deaths and six people wounded, including the shooter.
“While we didn’t ask for this burden, this is our generation’s fight,” said Andres Perez, president of the FSU chapter of Students Demand Action. “We will rise up and make our voices heard and demand changes so that no other person has to endure the tragedy and trauma that we face.”
The event was organized by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group formed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Members of Moms Demand Action, the grassroots arm of Everytown, and Students Demand Action, another affiliated group, were also in attendance.

Perez criticized the state’s Republican leadership for “trying to weaken gun safety laws,” referring specifically to the proposal passed in the state House that would lower the age to buy firearms from 21 to 18. “We cannot let that happen,” he said.
As it stands, 10 days away from the scheduled conclusion of the 60-day legislative session, that measure is not expected to become law, as a Senate companion bill was never heard in any committee. Similar proposals to reduce the age to purchase a firearm died in both the 2023 and 2024 sessions without moving at all in the Senate.
Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, who served as mayor of Parkland in 2018 when the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School occurred, said the longterm harm to people affected by gun violence is “terrible.”
“The taking away of feeling any sense of security and safety at all times,” she said. “Life is no longer normal once you have been experiencing the aftermath of a mass shooting. Life never goes back to normal. And we have to understand that as citizens. We have to understand that as lawmakers where we get the motivation to make sure that this never happens again.”
Hunschofsky was elected to serve in the Florida House nine months after the Parkland tragedy, and said she has faithfully sponsored legislation every year called the “Responsible Gun Ownership Act.”
“It starts with responsible gun ownership,” she said. “It starts with universal background checks. It starts with, if you own a gun, you need to store it safely so that it doesn’t get into the hands of someone who shouldn’t be having a gun in their hands. Let’s be clear. None of this violates the Second Amendment. None of this is radical. This is about with rights comes responsibilities.”
However, that bill once again did not move at all this session.

“Let’s be very clear — this is not normal. This is not freedom, and this is a failure of leadership,” said South Florida Democratic Sen. Lori Berman. “We live in a state where our leaders are actively making it easier to access guns.”
Logan Rubenstein, a 21-year-old junior at Florida State University, said he was in the eight grade and in middle school when Parkland happened approximately one mile away.
He praised then-Gov. Rick Scott and the GOP-controlled Legislature for passing the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public School Safety Act just weeks later, which in addition to raising the age to buy a firearm added a three-day waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a firearm, or until the background check is completed, whichever comes later. The law allows a court to issue a risk-protection order for up to 12 months and requires the surrender of all firearms and ammunition if such an order is issued (better known as a “red flag” law).
“For the last six years I’ve had to beg lawmakers to not reverse those reforms,” Rubenstein said. 
Stephanie Galdamez, a 19-year-old  FSU freshman who grew up in Tampa, held a sign listing other gun massacres over the past two decades and reading, “How many more?” 
“I think for it to be a tragedy it’s not enough to describe what happened, because it keeps happening over and over again,” she said. “It’s truly an American problem which keeps occurring and recurring and it’s preventable and yet it’s the number one killer of youth in America and we just want lawmakers to actually start doing things about it.”
About a half-hour after the press conference, North Florida Republican Sen. Corey Simon, a former football star at FSU, grew emotional when asked to give the prayer to begin Wednesday’s proceedings in the Senate.
“Today I rise and ask for a moment of silence for my Seminole family as we mourn those lives and the many lives that have been changed forever,” he said, before breaking down. Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle reached out to hug and comfort him.
There have been four mass shootings in Florida this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.Attorney General Keith Ellison is suing the Trump administration over two executive orders targeting transgender children and adults, alleging among other things that they amount to the federal government “commandeering the States to carry out federal law or policy,” which the 10th Amendment protects against.
“Trump’s unconscionable attack on this small number of vulnerable children is bullying, plain and simple,” Ellison said. “I’ve been around my share of bullies in my life, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you don’t give bullies an inch. We’re not going to cave at the expense of trans kids — or any vulnerable community that needs our compassion and protection.”
The orders in question attempt to ban transgender girls from competing in women’s sports and to impose a strict governmental definition of biological sex that does not recognize transgender individuals. 
Executive orders are not laws, but rather statements of administration policy. “An EO is nothing more than an interoffice memo from a boss to his underlings telling them what he wants them to do,” as Fordham law professor John Pfaff describes them.

Ellison argues that by abiding by the White House orders, Minnesota would be violating its own Human Rights Act. 
The administration is threatening to withhold federal funding from states that refuse to toe the line on transgender issues. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights had begun an investigation into Minnesota over the state’s refusal to ban trans kids from school sports. 
The administration has been working to dismantle the Department of Education, however, and it is unclear whether its Office of Civil Rights even has enough staff to carry out such an investigation. 
The office hasn’t officially opened up a new investigation since Trump’s inauguration, according to the Department of Education website, and the newsroom of the Office of Civil Rights hasn’t issued any updates since the beginning of February.
Bondi has nevertheless continued to make vague threats in Minnesota’s direction, and Ellison’s lawsuit is a response to those actions. He has asked the federal court to declare that specific parts of the administration’s orders are unlawful and constitutional, and to prohibit the administration from enforcing them against Minnesota.
This is at least the 14th lawsuit against the Trump administration that Minnesota has filed or joined. The others include challenges to administration actions on probationary federal employees; the dismantling of the Department of Education; cuts to museum and library services; other education cuts; sweeping voting restrictions; cuts to HHS grants; cuts to clean energy funding; the “Department of Government Efficiency”; birthright citizenship; federal spending; access to the Treasury payments system; restrictions on gender-affirming care; and multiple lawsuits challenging cuts to National Institutes of Health grants.
“Sometimes countries face a moment like this — faced with a leader bent on destroying entire communities and instilling fear in those who protect them,” Ellison said. “The lessons of history tell us a leader like that doesn’t stop at one community — after he’s destroyed one, he goes after another, and another, and another.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2181-1024x528.jpg,,,2025-04-23 13:11:35.026074

Davis, a Democrat, narrowly defeated Buckhout in the eastern North Carolina district that Republicans in the state legislature redrew in 2023 to make it easier for a Republican to win. The mostly rural district is considered the state’s only toss-up.
Roberson’s campaign announcement echoed the themes Buckhout emphasized in her own campaign: the border, fentanyl, and the economy.
“I’m running for Congress because North Carolinians deserve a representative who isn’t afraid to take on the tough issues,” Roberson said in a statement. “In Congress, I’ll stand with President Trump to secure our border, stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into our region, and unleash the American economy to benefit the citizens of North Carolina’s First District.”
Roberson’s announcement said he’s committed to spending at least $2 million of his own money “to help jumpstart his campaign.”
Roberson lost a bitter primary for the 2022 Republican nomination to Sandy Smith. A super PAC linked to the U.S. House Republican leadership spent about $600,000 to support Roberson in that primary. Roberson loaned his 2022 primary campaign more than $1 million, according to FEC filings.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-26-at-1.28.56-PM.png,,,2025-04-23 13:11:35.026074

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Photo courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.
But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.) speaks to voters at the historic Chatham County Courthouse. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Congresswoman Valerie Foushee (D-NC4) condemned the Trump administration at a Pittsboro town hall Tuesday evening for carrying out a “campaign to undermine the very foundations of our democracy.”
Foushee was joined by fellow Democrats, Rep. Robert T. Reives II, the minority leader of the state House of Representatives, and Karen Howard, the chair of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners, at a gathering that brought around 100 of their constituents to the historic Chatham County Courthouse for a little over an hour.
Unlike high profile town halls held by Republicans around the U.S., Foushee’s event drew a largely friendly, if anxious, crowd. Questions focused on steps she and other Democrats were taking to resist the Trump administration’s cuts to funding for education, scientific research, and social services.
Foushee spent most of the event taking aim at President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, condemning efforts to “target our rights, gut governmental protections, defund public education, criminalize immigrants and asylum seekers, weaken worker protections, and slash social safety net programs.”
“What we are currently facing is truly unprecedented. The stakes are high, and the urgency is real. This is a moment where we all need to show up, speak out, and stand together,” Foushee said. “The American people cannot afford this extreme agenda, and frankly, our democracy cannot afford this extreme agenda either. Our country is facing a constitutional crisis, one that demands urgent action.”
She added that she was particularly concerned by threats to the legitimacy of elections, telling the audience that “nothing hurt more” in the first 100 days than the House passage of the SAVE Act — a measure to require proof of citizenship at polling places that voting rights advocacy groups warn could disenfranchise millions of legal voters. Foushee invoked the ongoing legal challenge by losing state Supreme Court candidate Jefferson Griffin as another attack on election integrity.
“We have to protect the right to vote because we know what is coming forward to some make sure that some folk are not given access to the ballot box,” Foushee said. “We have to stand up against those types of legislation.”
Among the audience members who spoke was a teacher at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics who asked what he should tell the aspiring scientists in his classes amid the administration’s broad cuts to research and education.
In response, Rep. Reives said these efforts are evidence that Republican officials and their donors are “scared to death of an educated populace,” and that it’s critical to stay focused on the importance of education amid attempts to distract from those issues in the coming years.
“There’s one group of people in the entire country who are trying to stop everybody else from achieving an American dream, and that are the wealthy billionaires that have taken over your government,” Reives said. “Somehow, they have convinced themselves that, God help us, if you get an education, if you’re healthy and you get a chance to work, that somehow they’re going to lose that billion dollars before they die.”

Howard, the county commission chair, said the most important thing attendees of the town hall could do is act as “ambassadors” to their friends and neighbors so that they fully understand the consequences of the election. She invited the NCSSM teacher to bring her letters from his class about what education opportunities mean to them that she can deliver in an upcoming meeting with U.S. Senators Thom Tillis and Ted Budd.
“We need to broaden our tent, and we need to start reaching out to people that can hear us,” Howard said. “Every single person in every single audience that you ever sit in has somebody that will listen to them, someone who believes them, someone who trusts them.”
Reives cited the ongoing tribulations surrounding Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as proof that just a few lawmakers willing to resist Trump could make a substantial difference, noting that Tillis cast the deciding vote that allowed him to be confirmed. “Could you have gotten a better secretary?” he asked, drawing laughter from the town hall audience.
After the event, Durham resident Joe English said his respect for Reives was “greatly improved” after hearing him speak so emphatically about democracy and the crises facing the U.S. “To see the three of them interplay was phenomenal. This is what I needed,” English said.
He said while he would have liked to see more attendance, it was good to see Foushee holding an in-person discussion with constituents — adding that he was pleased when she did not attend Trump’s inauguration as a show of defiance.
Gary Simpson and Connie McAdams, local activists and members of Pittsboro Presbyterian Church, said they had tried to meet with Tillis earlier in the day but could only speak to a staffer in his office. Though they didn’t know about Foushee’s town hall in advance, they were able to get in at the last minute.
“I just applaud Valerie Foushee for doing this and giving people a chance to interact with her, and I appreciate her listening and trying to answer those hard questions,” McAdams said. “Everything is tough, and I appreciate her working as hard as she can in tough circumstances to make things better for all of us.”
Foushee’s take-home message was that while she and other Democrats can vote against the Trump administration’s agenda, it’s up to engaged citizens to vote out officials supporting his initiatives and to convince the people in their lives to do the same — a call to action that drew applause throughout the historic courtroom.
“Don’t be surprised when that person does exactly what he said he would do. Nothing should surprise you except how quickly he was able to do it,” Foushee said. “What you can do is to change the faces of the folks in the spaces that determine the future of this generation and the next generation and generations to come.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4221547-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 13:11:35.026074

The gift from Peter McCausland and his wife Bonnie, of Palm Beach, Florida, marks the largest single donation to South Carolina’s largest public university system.

In return, USC will name its college of arts and science for McCausland, a native of Philadelphia who received his bachelor’s from USC in 1971 and law degree in 1974.
In 1982, he started Airgas, which supplies gases for a variety of uses, including oxygen for patients, acetylene for welding, and propane for heating.
The McCauslands’ landmark gift will fund 150 annual summer internship stipends for students creating “one of the top career development programs available to students in the liberal arts and sciences in the country.”
McCausland, 75, said his fondest memories from USC came from professors who inspired him.
“I hope to continue the legacy of excellence of the faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences, while expanding the opportunities for students majoring in arts and sciences to leave USC with the curiosity and critical-thinking skills to help them pursue their dreams,” he said.
The donation, announced Wednesday in a ceremony on the historic USC Horseshoe, also will support the college’s neuroscience program, the college’s fastest-growing major, with research funds for student and faculty.
That will expand the work already being done through the family’s previous gift in 2006 for the university’s McCausland Center for Brain Imaging, which opened that year.
“I thought that was an ingenious way to launch this neuroscience curriculum,” McCausland said.
He noted the center, which serves patients during the day and provides a research tool for students after hospital hours, has since attracted more than $60 million of additional funding.
“So, they must be doing something right, and we were pleased to add on to that,” he said.
What USC’s planned $350M neurological hospital could mean for SC

And in 2013, McCausland donated $10 million to support early and mid-career, tenure-track faculty.
The brain health portion of the McCausland’s gift comes as USC seeks to build a $350 million specialized neurology and neurosurgery hospital and rehabilitation center designed to handle the state’s most severe stroke, dementia and brain injury cases.
“The McCauslands’ gift is truly extraordinary,” said Joel Samuels, dean of the McCausland College of Arts and Sciences.
“At a time when the value of liberal arts and sciences education has been placed in question — and in some cases, directly attacked — (the donation) sends a clear and unequivocal message that a liberal arts and sciences education matters,” Samuels continued.
The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest study area within the university. Every student, whether pursuing a major within that particular college or not, takes classes with arts and sciences professors, President Michael Amiridis said.

“I think there’s a lot of buzz in higher education now about more vocational training and preparing people for the workforce. I think it’s good that people are questioning the value of a college education. I don’t think it’s necessary for everyone,” McCausland said. “On the other hand, I think a liberal arts education gives you such a broad base.”
“Life doesn’t always work out the way that we wanted to,” McCausland added. “We get presented with lots of opportunities and challenges, and I think that a liberal arts education is the best way to take advantage of the opportunities and to meet the challenges.”
McCausland shared his own story as an example.
He started school as a chemistry major but graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history. He then stayed at USC for law school and started his own law practice before founding Airgas.
“I never had a business course, but I was prepared to succeed in business because of my liberal arts education,” McCausland said. “Business isn’t just about numbers. It’s about people and planning and history.”
McCausland sold Airgas in 2016 for $13.4 billion following a hostile takeover bid.
The final sale was more than double the original offer and McCausland negotiated to protect the jobs of nearly all his 17,000 employees.

House Bill 1163 would require gun buyers to apply for a five-year permit from the Washington State Patrol. To qualify, applicants must pay a fee and have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with some exceptions.
On a 57-39 vote Tuesday, Democrats in the House agreed with small changes the Senate made. Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat and gun control advocate, will decide the bill’s fate. 
The amendments included adding exemptions from the training mandate for licensed armed security guards and private investigators and delaying the effective date to May 2027.
Rep. Liz Berry, D-Seattle, said if Washington had the permit requirement in place a decade ago, the state would’ve seen about 250 fewer homicides and nearly 1,000 fewer suicides.
“Permit to purchase systems save lives,” Berry said in debate on the House floor. “They work. They make sure that guns don’t get into the hands of the wrong people. They make sure that guns aren’t diverted to black markets, and they prevent crime.”
Republicans argue criminals would ignore the requirement, so the legislation would do little to promote public safety while placing another hurdle to the constitutional right to bear arms.
Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said the bill “is not just unconstitutional,” but also “it is no guarantee that one murder will be prevented, that one assault will be prevented, that one suicide will be prevented.”
About a dozen other states have such permit-to-purchase systems. Courts across the country have largely upheld them.
Under the Washington legislation, if an applicant has completed the firearm safety course, the state has to approve the permit unless the person is barred from having guns, out of custody on bond awaiting trial or sentencing on felony charges, or the subject of an arrest warrant. 
Troopers must issue the permit within 30 days, or 60 days if the applicant doesn’t have a state ID. State patrol anticipates receiving at least 100,000 applications per year, with over 40 employees tasked with handling them.
The agency expects the new program will cost nearly $20 million in the 2027-29 budget cycle. Fees collected for fingerprinting and background checks would offset the cost, according to a fiscal analysis. The system could bring in $31 million in the 2027-29 budget.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/20230211gunOrama03-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-04-23 12:24:21.545199

(Mesquite City Council stream screengrab)The expectation before Tuesday night’s City Council meeting was that City Manager Edward “Owen” Dickie would likely get a slap on the wrist in the form of a written reprimand for making racially insensitive remarks on three separate occasions. 
Instead, four of five Mesquite City Council members voted to terminate Dickie after a parade of residents argued during public comment for his ouster. 
“We went from the safest city to the racist city,” said Mike Benham, one of the Mesquite residents who recorded Dickie’s comments, which were first reported by the Current. 
“…Early on, I said ‘guys, I’m going down to Louisiana, I’m going back to the back parishes and I’m going to find me a 6 foot 5 Black woman chief…’” Dickie is heard saying in one recording from February.  In another recording, he asserts he’ll bring back an “Aunt Jemima” should the need arise to replace then-Chief of Police MaQuade Chesley. In a third recording made by Chesley, Dickie can be heard using the ‘N’ word. 
“I stand against racism. I always have. I always will,” Chesley, the former police chief, told the council during public comment. “And when it happened in the (police) department, I brought it forth and I was pushed out.”
“I said things that I shouldn’t say at that time, trying to bring a little humor – poor taste of humor,” Dickie said in his defense, arguing that the offending comments were made in private.
“Mr. Dickie, you don’t get it. You wouldn’t say it in public, but you’d say it in private. So it’s okay?” Mesquite resident Mitch Miller asked rhetorically during public comment. “Our city depends on tourism. Our casinos, golf courses, businesses right now – we’re a national embarrassment for even considering a written reprimand versus termination.”
Miller went on to say city council members who vote in favor of retaining Dickie are “part of the bigger problem. You’re a closet racist in power.” 
“This was not just a poor attempt at humor, this was a harmful, arrogant and dismissive remark that reduces black women to caricatures, stereotypes and political pawns,” said Dr. Theresa Woolridge-Ofori. “I live here to be an example to people who don’t know that there are Black people that are professionals that look like me, that look like my husband.” Her husband, Dr. Edward Ofori, is medical director of the Mesquite Women’s Clinic.  
“My greater concern is with the complicit behavior of those who stand by silently accepting, even enabling this kind of rhetoric,” Woolridge-Ofori added. “Silence in the face of racism is not neutrality, it’s complicity. So if and when our city officials try to use race to win a war, then shame on you.”
Resident Eric Collings told the council his wife, a Black woman, deserved a personal apology from Dickie, and chastised the city manager for attempting to minimize his comments because they weren’t made publicly.  
“That’s the point,” Collings said. “I can tell a lot more about your character by what you do in private than what you do in public. This isn’t some old guy yelling to get off the lawn. This is the city manager of the City of Mesquite.”
“What he said was awful,” Mayor Jesse Whipple said before the vote. “He needs to be punished and reprimanded and possibly terminated.”
Whipple questioned whether Dickie should be judged by one mistake. 
“I’m offended. I’m not racist,” Councilman Paul Wanlass said, adding he agreed with Whipple.  “Do I judge a person by one mistake?”
Councilman Kevin Parrish called the episode a “PR nightmare” for the small city with a tourism-based economy. 
“The buck stops here,” Parrish said shortly before the council’s vote. “Being a boss, I can’t accept what he said. He will not be able to get a job in another city. Why should he be city manager here?”
Councilwoman Janine Gallo noted a string of “bad decisions” by Dickie, including firing Chesley at the behest of the local police union. “It’s time for this city to start healing,” she said before making the motion to terminate Dickie.  
Councilwoman Karen Fielding, who defended Dickie and blamed the public outcry to fire him on the individuals who recorded his comments, abstained from the vote. 
Chesley, in an email, called the meeting “an emotional evening, filled with stories of pain, discrimination and lifelong struggle,” adding he spoke “with many individuals who have long been marginalized and pushed aside in Mesquite, made to feel less than, unheard, and unwelcome. But for the first time in a long time, our city stood together to denounce racism and demand accountability firmly.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mesquite-meeting-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-04-23 12:24:21.545199

(Screenshot via the governor's X livestream)With just nine days left in the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday upped his criticism of the Florida House of Representatives and continued to defend First Lady Casey DeSantis and her flagship Hope Florida Foundation amid growing controversy.
DeSantis spent the first half of a news conference he called in Fort Pierce extolling the state’s economy during his governorship and repeated recent complaints about the House, which has sparred with the governor on matters including Highway Patrol funding, Everglades restoration funding, university presidential searches, and access to the courts — all coming after dueling special sessions in January and February on immigration laws.
“They are the least productive Florida House of Representatives that we have seen in modern Florida history, and I can tell you they are the least productive since I’ve been governor by a country mile. I mean it’s not even close in terms of what they’re doing,” DeSantis said.
He hammered away against the House for its proposal to reduce the state sales tax rather than property taxes, as the governor would prefer. DeSantis said the sales tax plan would benefit tourists, even though data show most sales taxes are paid by Florida residents.
DeSantis made the remarks at Indian River College, where he announced a round of aviation- and manufacturing-related infrastructure grants.










They are the least productive Florida House of Representatives that we have seen in modern Florida history, and I can tell you they are the least productive since I’ve been governor by a country mile. I mean it’s not even close in terms of what they’re doing.


– Gov. Ron DeSantis


House Speaker Daniel Perez has dismissed DeSantis’s displeasure, saying he is “emotional.” 
Each insists he is more conservative than the other. 
Hope Florida
DeSantis used the opportunity to play down the Hope Florida Foundation controversy, reiterating his assertion that it’s nothing more than a political attack against his wife and her initiative. 
“I think a lot of people are threatened by the success of the program. It upends some of their ideological commitments. It shows that she’s actually made a difference. I know there’s people that are threatened by that, so I think the Hope Florida program has been something that’s been a tremendous success for the state.” 
Health care giant Centene “donated” $10 million to the foundation as part of a $67 million Medicaid settlement involving pharmacy cost overpayments. The governor denied the money was Medicaid-related but documents obtained by the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times suggest otherwise.
The DeSantis administration has tried to explain the money in a letter to House Health Care Budget Committee chair Alex Andrade, who has been leading the investigation into the donation.
Two of the governor’s top health care secretaries aligned with the Hope Florida program, with the foundation supports, won’t be confirmed by the Senate this session.

Longtime Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. Senate, announced he will retire after his term ends in January 2027.

Longtime Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. Senate, announced he will retire after his term ends in January 2027.

“I truly love the job of being United State Senator, but in my heart, I know it’s time to pass the torch,” Durbin said in a social media video.

Durbin’s retirement will end a 44-year congressional career. The East St. Louis native who has lived in Springfield for the last five decades was first elected to the U.S. House in 1982.

Durbin, 80, won election to the U.S. Senate in 1996 to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, to whom Durbin served as legal counsel in the early 1970s when Simon was the state’s lieutenant governor. Durbin has since rose through the ranks of the Senate, chairing the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee and now serving as the No. 2 ranking Democrat in the Senate as minority whip.

“The people of Illinois have honored me with this responsibility longer than anyone elected to the Senate in our state’s history. I’m truly grateful,” Durbin said.

Durbin has kept decisions about his political future a closely guarded secret, telling reporters as recently as last week that he has not made any decisions about his future.

Durbin said at a news conference in downstate Taylorville last month that “whether I’m still physically able, mentally able to deal with the issues,” were the top factors guiding his decision. At the time, he suggested he was.

His retirement is expected to set off a flurry of moves by some of the state’s top Democrats who are widely believed to be interested in the seat, including Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and U.S. Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Lauren Underwood and Robin Kelly.

“We are also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,” Durbin said. “We need them now more than ever.”

With Durbin stepping aside in 2027, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Hoffman Estates Democrat, will become Illinois’ senior senator.

“It is only because of Dick’s empathy, patience, support and mentorship that I am in the United States Senate today,” Duckworth said in a statement. “It has been the honor of a lifetime to get to work alongside a leader who embodies what it means to be a true public servant.”

Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement that Durbin has been “a consistent leader and reliable champion” for Illinois.

“The people of Illinois should take great pride having a leader like Dick Durbin represent us in the U.S. Senate,” Pritzker said. “I have been proud to be his partner and am even more proud to call him my friend. He will leave some extraordinary shoes to fill – and has given us all an example of courage and righteousness for the work ahead.""

Cooperative Extension)North Carolina farmers are set to receive $25 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as the agency sends out a new round of relief to states impacted by disasters.
The new chunk of federal aid comes alongside $340.6 million announced by USDA on Tuesday. Secretary Brooke Rollins said the department was “doing everything we can to support state and local efforts to rebuild these communities to be even stronger than before.”
Tennessee is also set to receive $18 million in disaster aid, the USDA said. Western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee were both battered by Hurricane Helene last fall.
The USDA aid will go toward economic development for “enterprises and farm producers,” rebuilding infrastructure, drinking and wastewater and technical assistance for towns needing aid.
And the administration said Tuesday it was also eliminating several regulations and guidelines around the USDA’s disaster fund. That includes waiving income requirements and population limits, as well as responding to a backlog of requests from communities in recent years.
State officials have made agricultural aid one of the main pillars of their response to Hurricane Helene. In lawmakers’ most recent aid package, $300 million was allocated for crop loss reimbursement.
Leaders in the sector warned shortly after the storm that it had dealt a major blow to short- and long-term outlooks.
“It’s going to take huge money to help these people recover,” Jimmy Gentry, president of the agricultural advocacy group NC Grange, told lawmakers in December. “I hope you’ll keep that in mind. Assistance is going to be needed for a long time to come.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-extension-helene.jpg,,,2025-04-23 12:24:21.545199

Free.,U.S. Senate Dems request report on cuts to Social Security Administration,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-request-report-cuts-social-security-administration,,"WASHINGTON — A handful of leading U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday asked the Social Security Administration’s acting inspector general to examine how reductions in staff, closing some regional offices and other changes implemented by the Trump administration have impacted the safety net program.“These actions have already created a chilling effect among the agency’s workforce, with several senior SSA officials with centuries’ worth of institutional knowledge and experience having already left the agency,” the five senators wrote in a letter. “We are concerned that this hostile environment will foster burnout, low morale, higher attrition, and worse productivity among employees.“Collectively, this will undoubtedly lead to disruption in benefit payments and increasing barriers for Americans to access their Social Security benefits.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Special Committee on Aging ranking member Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., signed the letter.They requested the office look into how the changes have impacted customer service throughout the agency, the speed of disability appeals hearings and how quickly employees can process clearances, among other requests.The senators asked the acting inspector general to share quarterly updates on the effects “of the agency reorganization and any future workforce reductions” on customer service.The Social Security Administration’s office of the inspector general didn’t immediately respond to a request from States Newsroom about whether the independent watchdog would respond to the letter.Staff cutsThe Trump administration released a plan earlier this year to reduce the Social Security Administration’s workforce from 57,000 to 50,000 and close six of its ten regional offices.The Social Security Administration’s acting commissioner also announced that the agency would reduce its budget by $800 million during the current fiscal year through freezing SSA and Disability Determination Services hiring and “drastically” reducing overtime within that division, canceling Information Technology Systems contracts and closing down office space.U.S. DOGE Service, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has been spearheading efforts within the Trump administration to cut spending and restructure the executive branch.Musk, however, plans to shift his attention back toward his businesses starting in May after watching Tesla’s stock drop more than 40% this year, according to news reports.Nominee pledges to reduce wait timesPresident Donald Trump’s pick to lead the SSA, Frank Bisignano, hasn’t yet received Senate confirmation but did pledge during his hearing in March that if approved, he would ensure beneficiaries have the option to visit an office, use the website, or speak to a real person after calling the 1-800 number.“On the phone, I'm committed to reducing wait times and providing beneficiaries with a better experience; waiting 20 minutes-plus to get an answer will be of yesteryear,” Bisignano said at the time. “I also believe we can significantly improve the length of the disability claim process.”The Senate Finance Committee voted along party lines earlier this month to send Bisignano's nomination to the floor, though GOP leaders haven’t scheduled a vote.Democrats have criticized the Trump administration’s actions toward the Social Security Administration for months, arguing that staff cuts and proposed changes to how the agency operates could cause significant issues for recipients.Former President Joe Biden made changes to the Social Security Administration the subject of his first public address after leaving office, urging the Trump administration to reverse course.“Social Security is about more than retirement accounts. It’s about honoring a fundamental trust between government and people,” Biden said during the Chicago appearance. “It's about peace of mind for those who work their whole lives, so they can rest assured they’ll have a chance to get back some of what they earned and what they deserve.”",,,,2025-04-23 12:24:21.545199

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA – Kansas Corporation Commission staff on Tuesday testified about the need to expand Evergy’s power generation capabilities and defended their decision to support the company’s request to build two natural gas plants.
Evergy and other utility companies file an Integrated Resource Plan with the KCC that details its decision-making process, expectations of capacity needs in the future and how those needs will be met.
During the second day of a three-day KCC hearing, opponents questioned Evergy and KCC officials about why they believe natural gas plants are the best way to provide energy to its customers in the future. The company has announced plans to build two plants, the Viola power plant in Sumner County, expected to be online in 2029, and the McNew power plant  in Reno County, in service in 2030.
The plants, according to testimony, will add 710 megawatts of power each to the company’s generation portfolio and have an expected life of 40 years. Generally, 1 megawatts will power 1,000 homes, so the addition of 1,420 megawatts will power about 1.4 million homes.
 
Reliability is key
Justin Grady, KCC deputy director of utilities, testified there are 157 new natural gas plants being contemplated or being built in the country right now. He said the need for reliable gas generation capability is significant.
“I spent quite a bit of time in my testimony in this docket on the issue of reliability for these power plants,” Grady said. “Admittedly, if I’d had to write this testimony two years ago, that would have been much more difficult testimony to write. As you know, every major national or regional reliability organization for a couple years now has really been sounding the alarm, saying, ‘Hey, we need to slow down a little bit on the energy transition.’ This is not the time to be making permanent retirement decisions. Especially for winter reliability, we really need to maintain the dispatchable capacity we have. We might need to add new dispatchable capacity. So I think we need these plants.”
Dispatchable generation refers to power generation plants that can ramp up or down quickly based on an area’s need for power.
 
SPP points to reliability concerns 
Grady said the Southwest Power Pool, which is the regional transmission organization that ensures reliable power supplies and infrastructure,  has also been expressing concerns about reliability within the system.
Indeed, the organization’s website highlights the challenges facing the industry.
“We are facing an increase in extreme weather events that are causing grid emergencies, tight operating conditions, and risks to human health and safety. In the past, there were only a few weeks in summer when SPP risked running out of energy,” Southwest Power Pool President Barbara Sugg said in a letter posted online. “Now, we are issuing grid alerts throughout the summer as well as during winter. Our risk of having inadequate supply to meet demand has greatly increased, and grid emergencies are likely to last longer, cause more damage and increase risks to human health and safety.”
Jim Zakoura, an attorney for the Kansas Industrial Consumers group, which represents large-volume energy users, questioned Grady about why KCC staff didn’t offer options for the commissioners to consider, such as putting one plant in and waiting five years to put another plant in, that would have decreased the retail rate impact in the present plan. That has been their usual practice, Zakoura said.
Grady agreed that it has been, but said the depth of the proposal for this hearing required him to work 60 to 80 hours per week for six to eight weeks to properly evaluate and then file the testimony in this docket.
However, he said, some of his testimony shared views on whether or not Evergy should abandon its thermal generation plans and move in the direction of more solar, battery storage and wind.
But if Evergy would have appeared before the commission to only build half of the natural gas plants and instead to double-down on solar, Grady said he would not have agreed with that plan.
“I would not have been a supporter of that, unless they showed me critical use permits in hand from local communities, willing local communities that wanted to host that solar,” Grady said. “It’s getting more and more difficult to build those kind of resources.
  Justin Grady, Kansas Corporation Commission deputy director of utilities, testified Tuesday about his support for additional generation capacity to provide electricity in Kansas. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)
Straight talk
Grady did not hesitate to point out that he disagreed with several witnesses who entered testimony about other ways Evergy could achieve its goal of creating more power generation. He referred to testimony by Michael Gorman, a consultant hired by KIC who recommended that KCC deny Evergy’s petition to build two plants.
Gorman’s testimony pointed, among other issues, to Evergy’s decision to choose a resource plan that is not the least expensive option, that customers will pay a Construction Work in Progress, referred to as a CWIP,  and that there are unknowns about the new plants costs. The CWIP charge that can be added to customer bills was approved by the Kansas Legislature in 2024. It allows utility companies to bill customers for a construction project while it is being built instead of waiting until it is complete and power is being generated.
Grady said that without Gorman’s testimony in front of him he believed the primary objections were to the early retirement of the coal plants, which is in Evergy’s plans for the next few years.
“My recollection was his primary criticism was that this plan relies on and is predicated upon the retirement of Jeffrey 2 and Jeffrey 3. As I interpret from his testimony and from your (Zakoura’s) opening statement, the position generally of KIC parties in this docket, you guys generally don’t want to retire those coal facilities and you don’t want to plan for the retirement of those coal facilities,” Grady said. “That’s a pretty fundamental difference of opinion that we have in this case.”
Zakoura questioned the cost to consumers if Evergy retires coal plants that have an existing net book value, meaning the value remaining if the asset has not been fully depreciated. Grady said that while KCC can’t direct Evergy to use a Kansas securitization statute, he fully expects the company would do so, which would mitigate the costs to consumers. The securitization statute allows companies to repay debt through issuing bonds so the debt can be repaid over a longer time period. For instance, Kansas Gas Service used securitization after winter storm Uri in 2021 to help customers absorb the costs of meeting energy needs generated by that storm in smaller increments.
 
Not all ‘eggs’ in solar, battery basket
Grady had similar objections to testimony by Citizens Utility Ratepayer Board witness Lucy Metz, an associate with Synapse Energy Economics, who was a proponent of looking for other ways to expand Evergy’s power generation than through construction of natural gas plants.
“Evergy Kansas Central did not robustly analyze and test the market for alternatives to Viola and McNew — including batteries added at sites with existing interconnection rights and additional gas conversions of coal units — and therefore has not demonstrated that the CCGTs (combine cycle gas turbines) are the lowest cost way to meet its capacity and energy needs,” Metz said in her filed testimony. “Solar and battery additions, including the Kansas Sky project, are likely lower cost than Viola and McNew, will shield ratepayers from future cost risks, and can be procured incrementally. This would allow Evergy greater flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and supply chain disruptions.”
Her testimony, Grady said, misses the mark.
“Maybe some of this isn’t her fault because it was developed prior to the recent turmoil with regard to potential trade issues and tariffs, but as evidenced by literally today’s announcement of solar tariffs on southeast Asia, I think there is an incredible amount of risk, uncertainty in terms of our ability to import into this country, to build significant amounts of utility-scale solar,” Grady said. “Everybody in this room knows there is a lot of uncertainty with regard to the Clean Energy Tax Credits and the future of those, and I was real direct about that in my testimony.”
Grady said he’d been a vocal supporter of solar but the uncertain environment right now makes a difference.
“I’m still supportive of solar,” he said. “But I think we all owe it to ourselves to back up a little and realize, this is a pretty uncertain environment to be putting all of our eggs in the solar and battery basket. I disagree with the fundamental conclusions that she draws.”
The KCC hearing continues Wednesday, with experts who disagree with Grady’s conclusions expected to testify.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P1010037-1024x697.jpeg,,,2025-04-23 12:24:21.545199

Some are also seeking to add Asian history into the statewide learning results.
Sponsors described the public hearings for three of the four bills in the Education Committee on Tuesday as “déjà vu,” as the earlier iterations nearly passed last session but died due to procedural disagreements. 
Now these proposals are being weighed as the federal government has set out to eradicate diversity efforts in public schools. The concept of diversity, equity and inclusion was on some committee members’ minds, with Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham) requesting how much money Maine has used from the federal government and taxpayers for DEI.
But DEI is not what these bills are after, their sponsors explained. 
“This is not diversity, equity, inclusion,” Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Portland) said plainly. “This is a uniquely American story that’s not like any other story that must be told.”
Talbot Ross, who is again proposing an African American studies advisory council to ensure the learning requirements that became law in 2021 are being met, said the issue at hand is follow through. 
“We’ll continue to see these bills year after year after year if you don’t fund the financial and human resources to implement them,” Talbot Ross said. “It is a waste of this Legislature’s time, by the way, to continue to do our work this way.”
As the state faces a substantial budget deficit, the fiscal notes of these bills will be up for debate and sponsors acknowledged that there will be give and take. “But I just don’t want to see any of this, that’s already law, stalled any further,” Talbot Ross said.  
The bills’ sponsors are also intent on not repeating what they view as another past inadequacy: combining legislation, as proposals to ensure effective implementation of Wabanaki and African American studies were consolidated last session. 
“To merge the bills would be to undermine the logistical purpose of each bill,” said Rep. Ellie Sato (D-Gorham), sponsor of the bill to add Asian history into the statewide learning results. 
A proposed addition to history curricula 
“Learning about Asian American history in schools will help other Asian adoptees like me learn to accept their identity,” YuJi Smith, a tenth grader from Edgecomb, told the Education Committee. 
YuJi and her mother, Kimberly Smith, testified in support of LD 957, which would require Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander history to be included in the next review of content standards and performance indicators. 
The intention behind LD 957, sponsored by Sato and bipartisan cosponsors, is underscored by the 2022 Social Tracking of Asian Americans in the U.S. Index, which found that education is the highest recommended solution to combat anti-Asian racism and found significant gaps in knowledge around AANHPI history, Sato said. 
Through tears, Kimberly Smith told lawmakers about how her daughter has experienced racism, increasingly so since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“We have all seen the rise of anti-Asian bullying violence and racism since COVID and my concern is with the current national politics of othering,” Smith said. “This situation is only going to get worse.”
LD 957 is about inclusion not division, said Marpheen Chann, executive director of Khmer Maine, a community-based organization supporting Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander communities. 
“It’s about equipping our young people with knowledge, not ideology,” Chann said.  
Grace Valenzuela, executive director of communications and family community partnerships for Portland Public Schools who came to Maine in 1986 from the Philippines, said she’s seen firsthand the power of students seeing themselves reflected in curriculum. 
“It affirms their place in our shared story, and it fosters empathy in their peers,” Valenzuela said. 
However, should this bill pass, schools administrators and others are anticipating familiar challenges with ensuring effective implementation.
Eileen King, deputy executive director of the Maine School Management Association, raised concern about LD 957 being a mandate to require curriculum development possibly without additional resources. 
“We have seen how similar efforts in the past – such as the 2001 Wabanaki Studies law – have resulted in poor implementation due to wavering state commitments,” King said, “and our associations are concerned that this bill could be met with a similar fate, as local districts may struggle to implement it without strong funding to develop curriculum and share it with teachers and curricular leaders in every school district.”
‘Déjà vu’
Last year, a bill to establish a commission on Wabanaki and African American studies and a bill to pilot Wabanaki-centered curricula for Indigenous students attending public high schools both ultimately died without final action. 
The bills initially passed both chambers of the Maine Legislature and were funded by the budget committee, though at lesser amounts than initially proposed, however lawmakers did not take the final approval votes necessary to pass the measures by the time the Legislature finally adjourned. 
These measures, in slightly different forms, are back for consideration this session.
African American studies
LD 1202, sponsored by Talbot Ross, would create the African American Studies Advisory Council to serve as a resource for educators, schools and the Department of Education to ensure the implementation of the curricula in accordance with existing state law. 
It also directs the Maine Department of Education to develop professional development opportunities on the subject for educators and the State Board of Education to convene a group to assess whether to include a requirement for a relevant course to be a credentialed educator in the state. 
Testifying in support of the bill, Christian Cotz, acting Maine state archivist, said the teacher training is crucial. 
“At the Maine State Archives, we regularly hear from Maine teachers who are seeking both resources and guidance on how to teach African American history,” Cotz said.
As she did last session during consideration of the earlier iteration of this bill, Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) said she had concerns about focusing studies on any one particular group. 
“All their journeys matter,” Lyman said, listing off groups who contributed to Maine’s history, such as Irish immigrants. “Would you agree that we need to be cautionary on any judgments that we make?”
Talbot Ross described that line of questioning as conflating a number of things. Pointing to the joint session for Franco American Day on Wednesday, the senator said if Lyman’s philosophy were to be followed that would mean the Legislature couldn’t honor Americans of French or French-Canadian descent without also having days to honor all other ethnicities. 
“This is already law,” Talbot Ross said of the required course of study. “I’m not asking you to create a new law. I’m asking you to help me implement it.”
Lyman and Talbot Ross did align over the question of what adequate implementation looks like, which Talbot Ross said her bill seeks to answer. 
The bill as currently written requires$1 million to support this work and provide grants to schools to expand or implement curricula, though Talbot Ross said she’s not married to that figure. 
“I remain proud of my state for taking this step forward,” Talbot Ross said. “I hope that we can take the next step so it’s not just symbolic.” 
Wabanaki studies
LD 1474, sponsored by Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono), would permanently establish a Wabanaki studies specialist in the Maine Department of Education to ensure the standards are being met. Brianne Lolar has served in that role so far.  
Like Talbot Ross, Osher emphasized that her bill is about following through on commitments the state has already made. 
In order to ensure effective teaching, the bill would also direct the State Board of Education to adopt rules to require a Wabanaki studies component in the qualifications for certifying teachers.
School boards and superintendents are largely in support of the bill but object to adding the qualification for teaching certification due to existing challenges with filling the workforce, according to King with the Maine School Management Association. 
School districts have failed to consistently and appropriately include Wabanaki studies in their curricula, according to a 2022 report from the Abbe Museum, ACLU of Maine, Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission and Wabanaki Alliance. 
The report was not intended to be a “gotcha” moment for these schools but a baseline to figure out how to move forward, said Maulian Bryant, executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance. Since the report, Bryant commended Lolar’s work connecting Wabanaki advisors with educators and creating culturally accurate curriculum. 
“By supporting LD 1474 you can ensure that the progress the Wabanaki studies specialist has made in resource development, Wabanaki knowledge being accessible and valued, and the uplifting benefits of everyone in Maine understanding more about the Indigenous stewards past and present,” Bryant said. 
Wabanaki-centered curricula for Indigenous students
LD 339 would pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools.
Native American students in Maine have the lowest high school graduation rate compared with other races, according to state data, and bill sponsor Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland) sees the bill as an initiative to address that disparity.  
Brennan said he felt a strong sense of “déjà vu” when he presented the plan on Tuesday, as it mirrors the version he put forth last year but with a different dollar amount attached. This year, Brennan is seeking $200,000 to support the development and piloting of this curricula — $100,000 for each year in the 2026-2027 biennium. 
In 2019, Gov. Janet Mills repealed proficiency-based diplomas and added the ability to count equivalent standards achievement in place of course credit, which would allow for this type of build-your-own curriculum.
Calais High School near the Canadian border has made the greatest strides so far toward such offerings. Lynn Mitchell, who works for Maine Indian Education, teaches the Passamaquoddy language at Calais High School. 
However, aside from Mitchell’s class, Superintendent of Maine Indian Education Reza Namin said Wabanaki students attending public school are currently navigating an education system that rarely reflects their heritage and history.
“This bill represents a critical step toward addressing this long standing imbalance,” Namin said. “A Wabanaki-centered curriculum is not merely cultural enrichment, it is an educational necessity.”

Last-minute edits to Senate Bill 442, a “human sexuality instruction” measure, were detailed Monday during a brief conference committee meeting.
The underlying legislation requires any materials used to teach “human sexuality” for grades 4-12 be approved by a school board and posted online. Additional language would mandate that elementary school students watch a three-minute ultrasound video of fetal development if they participate in human sexuality coursework.
In contention, however, was a provision to require any sex education curriculum to include instruction on “the importance of consent to sexual activity.”
Last-minute change removes requirement for Indiana schools to teach consent in sex education

Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, said earlier in the week that he intended to get rid of the language in the final version of his bill. He pointed to “different thoughts in different communities” and preferred to let school boards decide if local curricula include topics on consent.
The removal drew sharp pushback from Democrats on the conference committee, and Byrne backtracked the decision in a Wednesday morning statement.
“The primary goal of Senate Bill 442 is to promote transparency in sexual education curriculum by requiring that curriculum to be approved by school boards and posted publicly online,” he said. “The new conference committee report, which I approved yesterday morning, will also retain language added by the House of Representatives, which would require schools to teach about the importance of consent to sexual activity in an age-appropriate way and teach about fetal development during pregnancy. I look forward to shepherding this bill through the rest of the legislative process.”
The conference committee proposal had not been signed and officially approved as of Wednesday morning, however, meaning the bill’s provisions were not finalized and could still change.
The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course in schools. Instead, it only mandates that schools teach lessons on HIV and AIDS. Schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
Critics of the bill have argued that school boards already have the authority to review and approve curricular materials. State law further requires school corporations to make instructional materials available to parents so that they can consent to instruction on human sexuality.

Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, speaks on the Senate floor in April 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Local laws prohibiting landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive public assistance would be unenforceable under legislation approved by the Missouri Senate Tuesday night.
The bill takes aim at ordinances passed in several Missouri cities to protect tenants from discrimination based on the source of their income — especially tenants who use federal housing choice vouchers, known as Section 8 vouchers, to pay rent. It now returns to the House, which approved it earlier this year. 
If the House approves of the changes made in the Senate, the bill would go to the governor.

The bill was co-sponsored by state Reps. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City, and Ben Keathley, a Republican from Chesterfield. In the Senate, it was carried by state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance. 
Schroer on Tuesday called the bill “a common sense piece of legislation that prioritizes property rights over radical government overreach.”
Brown in a March Senate committee hearing called it a “property rights bill.” 
“Basically what has happened is [cities] are forcing people to take Section 8 housing,” Brown said. “…I would submit this kind of amounts to an illegal appropriation of private property. But there’s a very practical reason why a landlord may not want to do Section 8 housing.”
Kansas City passed a source of income discrimination ban last year, though it was in large part paused by the courts in February. 
Columbia, St. Louis, Webster Groves and Clayton have similar protections on the books. The laws make it illegal for landlords to discriminate based solely on the fact of renters’ lawful sources of income, including Section 8, veterans’ benefits and Social Security.
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, said Tuesday that the legislation would not only undo those local ordinances but exacerbate homelessness.
 “But really the fear for those who are the most vulnerable is that this would lead to further problems, expanding the homeless population,” she said
The bill to override these local policies passed the Senate after Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber of Columbia successfully added an amendment to allow those who receive veterans’ benefits to continue being protected from source-of-income based housing discrimination.

Proponents have characterized localities’ protections as overreach, forcing property owners’ hands. The bill has the support of landlords groups, apartment associations, the realtors’ association and the conservative think tank Show Me Institute.
During a hearing in January, Brown said proponents are “not unsympathetic to tenants that have some housing insecurities.
 “It’s not about the Section 8 tenant,” he said, “it’s about the program that we do not want to be forced into.” 
Not every property owner, he said, wants to undergo the bureaucratic hurdles to accept Section 8.
David Stokes, director of municipal policy at the Show Me Institute, said source of income discrimination bans are simply a “violation of the property rights of landlords.” 
Landlords, he said, shouldn’t be required to participate in a voluntary federal program.
“Just as the State of Missouri has long forbidden cities from imposing rent control,” he said, “this is just a very similar next step, and I think it will really benefit housing options and housing availability throughout Missouri.” 
In January’s hearing, Kansas City Councilman Johnathan Duncan emphasized that landlords under the ordinance can still screen tenants and deny individuals based on other reasons, just not for the sole basis of the source of their income. He said landlords could still deny applicants with violent criminal histories or low credit scores for instance. 
“I hope that representatives understand that we’re here to govern ourselves and definitely can pass our own laws,” Duncan said. “And I think it is an affront to the city of Kansas City and the other municipalities in the state of Missouri — that the state would know better than how we know and how to govern ourselves.” 
Opponents also said the bill could hurt affordable housing availability. The city of Kansas City has been opposed along with the anti-poverty nonprofit Empower Missouri and the group of public housing authorities Missouri Housing Authorities Association. 
Mallory Rusch, executive director of Empower, said in the January hearing that the discrimination bans help vulnerable Missourians secure housing.
“Discrimination bans like the one passed in Kansas City and other places in the state are really a key tool for local governments to prevent homelessness and ensure that those with the least among us can put a roof over their heads,” she said, “and we really believe that the state should not be preventing local governments from enacting these provisions when they know their communities best.” 
Gavriel Schreiber, general counsel to Kansas City’s mayor, testified in March that the bill “targets some of our most respected citizens, veterans, seniors,” because those individuals who get most of their income from benefits often don’t have their benefits counted toward their rent-to-income ratio mandated by landlords.
“The ordinance says at its base that if you have a lawful source of income, a landlord cannot refuse to rent to you simply because they don’t like where you get your lawful money from,” Schreiber said. 
Dozens of states and localities nationally have these protections, which cover around 60% of families with Section 8 vouchers, according to the federal government. 
Enforcement in states and cities where the protections have been passed has been somewhat mixed, but studies have found that overall the protections modestly improve outcomes for voucher holders.

Fueled by his massive ego, he’s driving roughshod over the American government, the American taxpayers, and the world at large.
After Trump declared that “Our country’s going to be based on merit…,” he appointed blind loyalists who pledged to destroy the departments or agencies they’d head. Their incompetence and inexperience promptly displayed itself when they invited a reporter to a chat discussing obviously classified information of an impending military attack. Trump, however, downplayed a monumental security error as a “glitch.”  In other words, he was never interested in merit, only obeisance —the better to rule with, my dear.
To bulldoze the rest of the government, Trump appointed Elon Musk to bypass the ineffectual cabinet and indiscriminately fire thousands of federal employees.  Consequently, government services to taxpayers have been compromised, government oversight has been blinded, and Trump’s cabinet has all the power of a hand puppet.  In short, Trump has eliminated all government accountability for his planned, lawless reign.
Trump’s blatant disrespect for the rule of law is superseded only by his avid desire for power.  In his own words, “He who saves his Country, does not violate any law.”  While this megalomaniacal and delusional claim of being a national savior raises questions about his mental fitness for democratic office, more troubling for our democracy is his belief that he’s above the law.
Lest we forget his reckless rap sheet, The President of the United States is a twice impeached, convicted felon, a bragging sexual predator, a serial liar, a demagogue, and a de facto dictator, whom the Trump- packed Supreme Court ruled immune from prosecution.
To this day, he declares that the 2020 Presidential election was “totally rigged.”  His idea of morality is that wining by any means necessary is right, and losing for any reason is wrong.  He’s pardoned the January 6 rioters convicted of violent felonies, calling them “patriots” and “hostages.”  And now he’s even considering compensating them for their criminal behavior and just imprisonment.
Trump’s second term is also a retribution tour.  He has steered his Justice Department to prosecute, penalize or otherwise interfere with lawyers and officials that prosecuted legal cases against him.  He’s also withdrawn security of those true patriots from his first term administration that received death threats for putting country and the Constitution before loyalty to Trump.  He’s also attacked judges that rule against his illegal machinations, claiming they are “conflicted,” or “left-wing lunatics,” or “Obama judges.” He even called for a judge’s impeachment because the judge had ruled against one of Trump’s executive orders to deport foreigners without just cause.
Overall, Trump has weaponized his administration to attack anyone that expresses views contrary to his, including private industry and institutions of higher education.  He has frozen or cut funds for both corporations and Ivy League schools unless they eliminate their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs, a blatantly racist attack on freedom of thought, speech, and policy.  He’s even attempted to deport foreign college students for peacefully protesting and exercising their right to free speech.
Amid this power rampage, it’s further chilling that Trump has said he’s “not joking” about seeking a third term in office despite the 22nd Amendment prohibition.  Believing he’s above the law, Trump claims there are “methods” to get around that Constitutional prohibition.  In other words, rather than enforcing the law, our President plots to circumvent it, solely to retain power.
Not content with bullying his own nation, he has shown no respect to our allies.  Instead, he’s betrayed, threatened, and extorted them at every turn, whether by slapping tariffs on our closest neighbors and trading partners, Canada and Mexico; or by withholding critical military aid and intelligence to Ukraine in its defense against a Russian aggressor; or by threatening both Greenland and Panama with a U.S. takeover.
And now, Trump is carelessly driving the nation into an economic recession fueled by his massive ego, imposing worldwide tariffs that will cost American consumers thousands of dollars annually, erase the savings of millions of investors, and alienate the rest of the world, including our allies. While this move has puzzled economists who see the folly of tariffs in reducing inflation and cutting consumer costs, perhaps they have not considered that the President is not content with putting his own nation under his thumb —he wants to bring the entire world to its economic knees at his despotic feet.
This president has shown neither honor nor decency; neither integrity nor morality.  He is a national embarrassment and an American disgrace. And so are we all for letting this happen.  Is this a leader we want to tell our children and grandchildren they can grow up to be?  How can we sleep?

Ang Dawa Sherpa nearly perished on his first Everest climb because he wasn’t prepared; then he went to school in Nepal for a mountain guide degree. After moving to the US, he wasn’t surprised to find that he needed some extra training to qualify for a higher paying job. When he needed a guide to the American higher education system, he turned to VSAC.
Read[...]","Newly arrived Vermonter Ang Dawa Sherpa leads a group up Mount Everest.According to modern historical records, 7,269 recorded individuals have summited Mount Everest, from Edmund Hillary’s history-making climb in 1953 through the end of 2024. Not only is Ang Dawa Sherpa one of those people, but he’s stood at the top 10 times. Ang, who is originally from Nepal and now lives in South Burlington, is a Sherpa—a name that is both an ethnic group and a job. The Sherpa people, who are native to the mountainous regions of Nepal, have long been known for their skills in mountaineering and serve as essential guides for visiting adventurers. Ang grew up in Solukhumbu, Nepal—about a five-day walk to the base of Mt. Everest, which sits on the border of Nepal and Tibet. He followed family members into the mountain guide business at age 21, when his uncle hired him on as part of a group expedition he was leading. But without having had any formal training, Ang barely survived that trip. Ang and his client, a climber from New Zealand, hit bad weather as they descended from the north (Tibet) side, which is more remote and has more challenging weather conditions. “The day we were coming down from Camp 3, it was very windy and snowing hard. The others stayed just below Camp 2, but I came down by myself to Camp 1. It was very hard. Then, when I arrived at camp, I didn’t zip my tent correctly. I didn’t get frostbite, but the conditions were very challenging, and my friends thought I was finished,” he says. “Now I realize how risky it was for me to do that without any experience.” There’s nothing like waking up in a tent full of snow on Mount Everest to make you realize the importance of education. Ang decided that for future expeditions, he’d get more training. In 2008, he took a mountaineering course from the Nepal Mountaineering Association, and he continued with several more advanced classes, including high mountain rescue, Wilderness First Responder and an experienced guide course, to earn a final diploma of mountaineering in 2016.  Ang and his wife, who have climbed Everest together, moved to the US almost two years ago after visiting Vermont for a climbing trip. Sherpa migration to the United States has increased in recent years, with New York City having about 16,000 people of Sherpa origin. But Ang prefers the peaks of Vermont to the skyscrapers of Manhattan. “I love being in Vermont because the state looks like my country, with a lot of mountains for hiking, skiing and adventure activities.”The couple plans to start a mountain guide business here, organizing Everest expeditions and a seven-summit mountaineering trip to climb the highest mountain on each of the seven continents—Mount Everest in Asia, Mount Elbrus in Europe, Aconcagua in South America, Denali in North America, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Mount Vinson in Antarctica, and Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania. “I want to share this experience with younger generations and pass along my training,” Ang says.But climbing expeditions typically only happen in the spring and early summer, and Ang needed something to do in the off-season. Back in Nepal, he worked as an instructor with the Nepal Mountain Instructor Association and did social work in his village. Here in Vermont, his options were more limited. When he learned about a way he could qualify for higher-paying work—by taking a CDL class to become a truck driver—he contacted VSAC’s Educational Opportunity Center, which helps adult students, including many newly arrived people like Ang, earn professional certifications.   Ang worked with VSAC counselor Hemant Ghising to enroll at Pro Driver Training in Milton and apply for funding that could help him pay for it. With the help of a VSAC Advancement Grant and The Curtis Fund – Credentials of Value Scholarship, Ang earned his CDL-B license earlier this year. While Ang says the CDL class was “a bit easier” than summiting Everest in a blizzard, he still faced challenges as someone still learning English and learning how to access the American higher education system—something that can be challenging for any student. “Hemant made the experience much easier, and he was so nice. I want to say thank you to VSAC for managing this and making it happen.”Ghising says he was instantly impressed with Ang’s gentle, compassionate nature. The two took a couple of hiking trips together outside the VSAC offices, trekking up Mt. Mansfield, Camel’s Hump, Smugglers’ Notch and Hunger Mountain. “Hemant showed me some great places in Vermont,” says Ang. “Maybe in the future I can take him to Nepal.” The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals. We create opportunities for all Vermont students, but particularly for those—of any age—who believe that the doors to education are closed to them. Growing families save for education with VT529, Vermont’s official 529 savings program. To help Vermonters plan and pay for college or job training, our counselors work with students in nearly every Vermont middle school and high school, and are also available to work with adults. Our grant, scholarship, and workforce development programs create opportunity, help students re-skill or learn new skills, and grow the economy.

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
Ivan Dimov was convicted of reckless driving in 2013, after fleeing police in Washington state while his passenger allegedly dumped heroin out the window. Before that, he got six DUIs in California over a six-year period. None of that would keep him off the road.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles reissued him a driver’s license in 2017. The next year, on Christmas Eve, he drove drunk again, running stop signs and a traffic light in midtown Sacramento, going more than 80 mph, court records show. He T-boned another car, killing a 28-year-old man who was going home to feed the cat before heading to his mom’s for the holiday.
Kostas Linardos had 17 tickets — including for speeding, reckless driving and street racing — and had been in four collisions. Then, in November 2022, he gunned his Ram 2500 truck as he entered a Placer County highway and slammed into the back of a disabled sedan, killing a toddler, court records show. He’s now facing felony manslaughter charges.
In December of last year, while that case was open, the DMV renewed his driver’s license.
Ervin Wyatt’s history behind the wheel spreads across two pages of a recent court filing: Fleeing police. Fleeing police again. Running a red light. Causing a traffic collision. Driving without a license, four times. A dozen speeding tickets.
Yet the DMV issued him a license in 2019. Wyatt promptly got three more speeding tickets, court records show. Prosecutors say he was speeding again in 2023 when he lost control and crashed into oncoming traffic, killing three women. He’s now facing murder charges in Stanislaus County.
The California Department of Motor Vehicles routinely allows drivers like these — with horrifying histories of dangerous driving, including DUIs, crashes and numerous tickets — to continue to operate on our roadways, a CalMatters investigation has found. Too often they go on to kill. Many keep driving even after they kill. Some go on to kill again.
With state lawmakers grappling with how to address the death toll on our roads, CalMatters wanted to understand how California handles dangerous drivers. We first asked the district attorneys for all 58 counties to provide us with a list of their vehicular manslaughter cases from 2019 through early last year. Every county but Santa Cruz provided the information.
Because California has no centralized court system and records aren’t online, we then traveled to courthouses up and down the state to read through tens of thousands of pages of files. Once we had defendants’ names and other information, we were able to get DMV driver reports for more than 2,600 of the defendants, providing details on their recent collisions, citations and license status.
The court records and driving histories reveal a state so concerned with people having access to motor vehicles for work and life that it allows deadly drivers to share our roads despite the cost. Officials may call driving a privilege, but they treat it as a right — often failing to take drivers’ licenses even after they kill someone on the road.
We found nearly 40% of the drivers charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 have a valid license.
That includes a driver with two separate convictions for vehicular manslaughter, for crashes that killed a 16-year-old girl in 2009 and a 25-year-old woman in 2020. In July of last year, the DMV issued him a driver’s license.
The agency gave licenses to nearly 150 people less than a year after they allegedly killed someone on the road, we found. And while the agency has since suspended some of those, often after a conviction, the majority remain valid. In Santa Clara County, a man prosecutors charged with manslaughter got his current license just a month and a half after the collision that killed a mother of three young children.
And many drivers accused of causing roadway deaths don’t appear to have stopped driving recklessly. Records show that nearly 400 got a ticket or were in another crash — or both — after their deadly collisions.
A commercial driver drove his semi truck on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County in 2021. Less than a year later, he still had a valid license when he barreled his semi into slow-moving traffic, hitting four vehicles and killing a woman in Fresno County, records show. Another man, sentenced to nine years in prison for killing two women while driving drunk, got his privileges restored by the DMV after being paroled, only to drive high on meth in Riverside and weave head-on into another car, killing a woman.
“It is somewhat shocking to see how much you can get away with and still be a licensed driver in the state of California,” Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said. “I don’t think anyone fully understands what you need to do behind the wheel to lose your driving privilege.”
Almost as interesting as the information in the drivers’ DMV records is what’s not there.
Hundreds of drivers’ DMV records simply don’t list convictions for manslaughter or another crime related to a fatal crash, we found. The apparent error means some drivers who should have their driving privileges suspended instead show up in DMV records as having a valid license.
The cases we reviewed cut across demographics and geography. Defendants include farmworkers and a farm owner. They include off-duty police officers and people with lengthy rap sheets, drivers who killed in a fit of rage and others whose recklessness took the lives of those they loved most — high school sweethearts, siblings, children. The tragedies span this vast state. From twisty two-lane mountain roads near the Oregon border to the dusty scrubland touching Mexico. From the crowded streets of San Francisco to the highways of the Inland Empire. From Gold Country, to timber country, to Silicon Valley, to the almond capital of the world. So much death. More people than are killed by guns.
Dangerous drivers are able to stay on the roads for many reasons. The state system that targets motorists who rack up tickets is designed to catch clusters of reckless behavior, not long-term patterns. And while there are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for certain crimes, like DUIs, there is no such requirement for many vehicular manslaughter convictions.
It’s often up to the DMV whether to act. Routinely it doesn’t.
The DMV declined to make its director, Steve Gordon — who has been in charge since Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him in 2019 — available for an interview to discuss our findings.
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, said the agency follows the law when issuing licenses. “We use our authority as mandated and as necessary,” he said.

Key takeaways: How the DMV allows dangerous drivers to stay on the road
How we did it: Reporting on California’s deadly drivers


Even when the DMV does take away motorists’ driving privileges, state officials, law enforcement and the courts are often unable or unwilling to keep them off the road. We found cases where drivers racked up numerous tickets while driving on a suspended license and faced little more than fines before eventually causing a fatal crash, even though authorities could have sent them to jail.
Taking away someone’s driving privilege is no small decision. It can consign a family to poverty, affecting job prospects, child care and medical decisions.
Still, the stakes couldn’t be higher. More than 20,000 people died on the roads of California from 2019 to early 2024.
Kowana Strong thinks part of the problem is that lawmakers and regulators are too quick to treat fatal crashes as an unfortunate fact of life, as opposed to something they can address.
Her son Melvin Strong III — who went by his middle name, Kwaun — was finishing college and planning to start a master’s program in kinesiology when he was killed by Dimov, the driver with six prior DUI convictions. Kwaun was a bright and innocent young man, she said, just starting his life.
“It’s just another accident as far as they’re concerned,” Kowana Strong said.
Holes in the DMV’s point system
Young people think they’re invincible. It’s the old who know how unfair life is, Jerrod Tejeda said.
His daughter Cassi Tejeda was just 22. She was months from graduating from Chico State with a bachelor’s degree in history and a plan to be a teacher. Outgoing and athletic, she wanted to travel, see the world and make her own life.
She had a girlfriend who was visiting. Courtney Kendall was 24 and a student at Louisiana State University.
On a Sunday afternoon in January 2022, a Volvo SUV topping speeds of 75 mph ran a red light and smashed into their Jeep, court records show. The collision killed them both.
“The most difficult part besides the incident is every day that goes by you’re always wondering what if. What would they be doing today?” Jerrod Tejeda said. “Would they be married? Would they have developed into the career that they chose? Where would she be living?”

Tanya Kendall lamented not being there to protect her daughter, hold her hand or say goodbye.
“Instead, I was left with the unbearable task of choosing what outfit she would be buried in. Buried, Your Honor. Not the gown she would wear to her graduation from LSU — the one she will never attend,” the mother wrote in a letter to a Butte County judge, adding that she and her husband stood in their daughter’s place, accepting her diploma.
Such pain was preventable.
The driver of the Volvo, Matthew Moen, had a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit, according to court filings. And it wasn’t his first time drinking and driving. Moen was caught driving drunk in Oregon in 2016. He never completed the requirements of a diversion program and had an outstanding warrant at the time of the fatal crash, the Butte County district attorney’s office said. In January 2020, he was convicted of DUI in Nevada County for driving with a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit, given a couple weeks in jail and put on probation for three years.
His license was valid at the time of the fatal 2022 crash, records show.

Across the country, states grapple with how to effectively spot and punish drivers who could be a danger on the road. Often they rely on a basic point system, with drivers accruing points for various types of traffic violations and thresholds for when the state will take away a motorist’s driving privileges. But like many, California has such high limits that drivers with a pattern of reckless behavior can avoid punishment.
The state suspends a driver’s license for accumulating four points in a year, six points in two years or eight points in three years. What does it take to get that many points? Using a cellphone while driving is zero points. A speeding ticket is a point. Vehicular manslaughter is two points.
Between March 2017 and March 2022, Trevor Cook received two citations for running red lights, got two speeding tickets and was deemed responsible for two collisions, including one in which someone was injured, court records show. (A third red-light ticket was dismissed.) At-fault collisions add a point to a driver’s license, according to the DMV. But the incidents were spaced out enough that none resulted in a suspension.
So Cook had a valid license on April 14, 2022, just a month after his last speeding ticket, when he blew through a Yolo County stop sign at more than 100 mph.
At that exact moment, Prajal Bista passed through the intersection, on his way to work after dinner and a movie with his wife, according to details of the crash that prosecutors included in court filings. Bista was driving the speed limit and on track to make it to work 30 minutes early.
The force of the collision nearly split Bista’s Honda Civic in half. Investigators determined Bista had been wearing his seat belt, but the crash tore it apart. They found his body 75 feet from the intersection.
On March 28, 2024, Cook pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter.
Just a month later, on April 30, the DMV issued Cook his current driver’s license, agency records show. Less than two weeks after that, he got a ticket for disobeying a traffic signal.
Melinda Aiello, chief deputy district attorney in Yolo County, said her office didn’t know anything about the new license or the red-light ticket until contacted by CalMatters. What’s more, the manslaughter conviction — like hundreds of others we found — isn’t listed on Cook’s driving record.
Cook’s license was still listed as valid in California DMV records as of early 2025. But for now, he’s off the roadways: Last summer, Cook started serving time in state prison.
“It’s stunning to me that eight months later his license is still showing as valid and the conviction for killing someone while driving is not reflected in his driving record,” Aiello said. “You killed somebody. I’d think there might be some license implications.”
Orrock, the DMV spokesperson, said he couldn’t speak directly to why so many convictions are missing. But, he said, “we acknowledge that the process and coordination between the judicial system and the DMV must continually evolve to address any gaps that have been identified. And we’re looking into that.”
Kill someone, get your license back
There are laws requiring the DMV to suspend a driver’s license for various convictions. A first DUI conviction, for example, is a 6-to-10-month suspension. Felony vehicular manslaughter is a three-year loss of driving privileges. The agency isn’t necessarily required to give a license back if its driver safety branch deems a motorist too dangerous to drive, agency officials said.
But CalMatters found the agency regularly gives drivers their licenses back as soon as the legally required period ends. And once crashes, tickets and suspensions fall off a driver’s record after a few years, it’s often as if the motorist’s record is wiped clean. So even if the driver gets in trouble again, the agency often treats any future crashes and traffic violations as isolated incidents, not as part of a longer pattern of reckless driving.
Perhaps that’s why Joshua Daugherty is licensed to drive in California.
In July 2020, Daugherty drifted onto the highway shoulder while driving near Mammoth Lakes, overcorrected to the left and lost control, court filings show. His Toyota Tacoma cut across the lane into oncoming traffic, where an SUV broadsided it. Daugherty’s girlfriend, 25-year-old Krystal Kazmark, died. Police noted that Daugherty’s eyes were red and watery and his speech was slurred when they arrived. He told officers that he’d smoked “a couple of bowls” of marijuana earlier in the day, according to records filed in court.
Kazmark’s mother was devastated. Like other victim relatives we spoke to for this story, Mary Kazmark tried as best she could to summarize a life into a few words — an impossible task. Her daughter liked to sing, travel, cook, draw, snow-ski, water-ski, wakeboard, hike, read, entertain friends and plan parties. She was a responsible kid, her mother said, always the designated driver with her friends. She oversaw guest reservations at one of the Mammoth Lakes lodges.
Mary Kazmark said she tracked down Daugherty on the phone a few days after the crash.
“He just said, ‘I can’t believe this happened again.’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’”
She eventually learned it wasn’t the first time Daugherty’s driving had killed.
In August 2009, in a strikingly similar incident, Daugherty was speeding along a Riverside County highway when his Ford Expedition drifted onto the shoulder. Witnesses told police he veered back to the left, lost control, hit a dirt embankment and went airborne, the SUV flipping onto its roof. A 16-year-old girl riding in the back died. Daugherty was convicted of misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. He was sentenced to 180 days in custody and three years’ probation, according to a summary of the case filed in court.
Because of the earlier manslaughter conviction, police recommended he be charged with murder for the death of Krystal Kazmark. But the Mono County district attorney’s office charged him with a mere misdemeanor.

Felony charges typically require a prosecutor to prove “gross negligence.” A prosecutor in another county described the difference between a felony and a misdemeanor this way: A felony is one in which you tell the average person the facts and they say, “Wow, that’s really dangerous.” A misdemeanor is one which they say, “That’s dumb but I’ve probably done it.”
The Mono County district attorney’s office refused to comment on the case, because the prosecutor and the elected DA at the time have both since retired. The office did provide a prepared statement explaining the charging decision. “It was determined that there was not a substantial likelihood of conviction at trial,” it said.
Daugherty pleaded guilty and was convicted in January 2023. He was sentenced to a year in jail. The DMV suspended his driving privileges after the fatal 2020 crash, a DMV report shows. But losing his license wasn’t enough to keep Daugherty off the road, records show.
Two months after his conviction for killing Kazmark, before he reported to jail, police caught him driving on a suspended license.
Still, the DMV reissued Daugherty a license in July 2024.
To recap: That’s two convictions for two dead young women, plus a conviction for driving on a suspended license, and the California DMV says Daugherty can still share the road with you.
“It’s so sad. You make a mistake and then you don’t learn from it and then you cause another person to lose their life,” Mary Kazmark said. “It’s unbelievable that he can continue to drive.”
Orrock said the DMV couldn’t comment on individual drivers.
When law enforcement reports a fatal crash, the agency’s driver safety branch flags all drivers who might be at fault. It then looks into the collision and decides whether the agency should suspend those motorists’ driving privileges. If the driver contests the action, there’s a hearing that could include witness testimony. Suspensions are open-ended. Drivers need to ask for their license back, and agency personnel decide whether the suspension should end or continue. These discretionary suspensions typically last for about a year.
And while officials said the DMV can continue a suspension if they think a driver poses a danger, Orrock said they need to give drivers an opportunity to get their license back. He said there’s no process in the state “to permanently revoke a license.”
Get your license back, get in trouble again
Roughly 400 drivers accused of causing a fatal crash since 2019 received a ticket, got in another collision or did both after the date they allegedly killed someone on the road. (The reports don’t show whether the drivers were found at fault, only that they were involved in an accident.) That’s about 15% of the drivers for whom we could get DMV reports.
Drivers like William Beasley.
From 2011 to 2016, Beasley collected five speeding tickets and a citation for running a red light in Sacramento County, court records show. Then around 9 a.m. on a sunny Tuesday in October 2019, he killed a man.
William and Deborah Hester were crossing the street to go to a dentist appointment at a veterans facility when Beasley’s silver pickup sped toward them. They thought they would make it across. But the truck didn’t stop. At the last minute, William Hester shoved his wife out of the way. She heard the truck smash into her husband’s body and screamed, according to court records.
Beasley still didn’t stop. He fled the area and tried to hide his truck. Investigators used nearby cameras and license plate readers to track him down days later. Beasley admitted to being in a collision.
He later pleaded no contest in Sacramento to hit-and-run and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter. A probation report in the case revealed Beasley was nearly blind in his left eye.

“Mr. Hester is with me every moment of my life,” Beasley said in an interview. “I took away a father, a grandfather, a husband, and they consider me a murderer. That’s not who I am.
“My accident with Mr. Hester was just that, an accident. Nothing more,” he said, adding that he worked as a courier for years and sometimes got speeding tickets because he was rushing.
In May 2020, the DMV took away his driving privileges.
In November 2022, Beasley got his license back — “because I could and I needed to,” he said, adding that people deserve second chances, particularly for accidents.
Almost immediately — less than three weeks after getting his license — he was in another collision, his DMV report shows. In early 2024, he got in yet another. His license was suspended when his car insurance was canceled, records show.
“It makes no sense to me that they would give him a license and give him the opportunity to hurt someone else,” said Loriann Hester Page, William Hester’s daughter.
Her father’s death broke the family, she said. He drove a tank in the Army, played guitar in a band, liked to ride horses.
“My dad was such a wonderful, kind man,” she said. “He would always walk in a room and wanted to make everyone smile.”
Beasley said he doesn’t plan to drive again.
“I am 75 years old,” he said. “I am blind in one eye. I have had a situation where a man was killed, he lost his life. I am not going to repeat that situation at all.”
Still on the road, license not suspended
The DMV does have the ability to act quickly. In some cases, it suspended a driver’s license shortly after a fatal crash. However, we found numerous cases in which the DMV did nothing for months or years, often not until a criminal conviction.
In July 2021, truck driver Baljit Singh drove his semi on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, killing a motorcyclist in Kern County, court records show. There are no suspensions listed on his DMV record during that time, even though the agency has the discretion to suspend someone’s license without a conviction.
Less than a year later, as his case wound its way through the slow-moving court system, Singh plowed his semi into the back of a car in Fresno County, killing a woman, records show. He ultimately pleaded no contest to felony vehicular manslaughter in Kern County. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter in Fresno for the second fatal crash. The DMV finally took away his driving privileges in February of last year.
Prosecutors say Jadon Mendez was speeding in December 2021 in Santa Clara County when he lost control and caused a crash that killed a mother of three young children. A few weeks later he got a speeding ticket. And yet, the DMV issued him his current driver’s license on Jan. 27, 2022 — 49 days after the fatal crash.
There were no suspensions listed on his DMV record as of early this year, even though Mendez was charged with manslaughter in May 2022. The judge in his case ordered him not to drive, as a condition of his release. But such court orders don’t necessarily show up on a driver’s DMV record.
That might be why he didn’t get in more trouble in December 2022 when he got a speeding ticket in Alameda County. Prosecutors didn’t know about that ticket until CalMatters asked about it, said Angela Bernhard, assistant DA in the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office.
Mendez’s manslaughter case is still open, and his license is still listed as valid.
When asked about the Mendez case and others, Orrock acknowledged that while there’s a DMV process for deciding when to revoke or suspend a license, “sometimes the process takes a while to happen.”
When the DMV doesn’t act at all
In many cases, the DMV doesn’t take action even after a conviction.
In May 2022, a semi driver named Ramon Pacheco made a U-turn in front of an oncoming motorcycle, killing 29-year-old Dominic Lopez-Toney, who was finishing his rotations to be a doctor.
Court records show Pacheco had gotten in trouble behind the wheel before. He had been arrested for DUI in 2009, caused a collision in 2013 and got a ticket in 2016 for making an unsafe turn. It wasn’t enough to keep him off the road.
Neither was killing a man.
Months after San Joaquin prosecutors charged Pacheco with vehicular manslaughter, he got into another collision for which he was also deemed most at fault.
As the case dragged on, Lopez-Toney’s large but tight-knit family wrote dozens of letters to the court, pleading for justice. Dorothy Toney wrote that, more than a year since her grandson’s death, she was still haunted by images of his “mangled and broken body” and the gruesome details in the police report. “Somedays,” she wrote, “I wish I had been there to gently hold his hands” and “tell him how much I loved him.”
The letters are full of shock and outrage that the driver had faced so few consequences. “Allowing this truck driver to continue driving and engaging in civilian activities with only a mere consequence of probation is appalling,” wrote Lynelle Sigona, the victim’s aunt.
Pacheco ultimately pleaded no contest to misdemeanor manslaughter and received probation. His DMV record as of Feb. 11 indicates his driving privileges were never suspended; his commercial driver’s license is valid.
Pacheco’s defense attorney, Gil Somera, said his client isn’t a reckless driver. His prior incidents are relatively minimal, he said, given the fact that “truck drivers drive thousands and thousands of miles a year.” Pacheco needed to turn around and didn’t think there was another place he could do so, since he was approaching a residential area, Somera added.
Pacheco wasn’t being “inattentive or reckless,” Somera said. “And it’s unfortunate and sad and tragic this young man died because of this decision he made to make a U-turn.”
In the wake of the tragedy, Lopez-Toney’s mother has become an advocate for truck safety.
“Road safety and truck safety is not a priority right now with our legislators, with our government,” Nora Lopez said. “Changing our mindset, our attitudes, our culture on the roads is not impossible.”

(Christie Hemm Klok for CalMatters)
In an interview at her Castro Valley home, she talked about her only child. He was smart and caring, liked snowboarding and animals, loved food. On vacations they would take cooking classes together, Lopez said. He studied molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and was almost done with medical school.
She still has the dry-erase whiteboards in his old room. One is filled with his small and neat study notes; another has what appears to be a to-do list. There’s a note that says “Surgery: 600.” Lopez said that’s when he was due to start his surgical rotation in a San Joaquin hospital, just a couple of days after he died.
She said he just wanted to help people and serve the Native American community as a doctor, a future that a driver snatched away.
“It’s because of a man’s recklessness and carelessness — no regard for humanity,” she said.
While felony manslaughter is an automatic three-year loss of driving privileges, a misdemeanor typically carries no such penalty. It’s discretionary — it’s up to the DMV to decide whether to do anything. And the man who killed Lopez-Toney is far from alone in facing no apparent punishment from the DMV.
We found nearly 200 drivers with a valid license whose DMV record shows a conviction for misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter but for whom there is no suspension listed.
When shown a copy of Pacheco’s current driving report, Lopez sat in silence for several seconds.
“Does this make sense to you? It makes no sense to me,” she said. “With his record, how does he still have a license?”
‘Are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?’
Research on dangerous drivers appears to be thin and largely outdated.
Liza Lutzker, a researcher at UC Berkeley’s Safe Transportation Research and Education Center, said much of the focus in the traffic safety world is on creating better design and infrastructure, so people who make honest mistakes don’t end up killing someone.
“I think that the issues of these reckless drivers are a separate and complex problem,” Lutzker said. “The system we have clearly is not working. And people are paying with their lives for it.”
Jeffrey Michael, who researches roadway safety issues at Johns Hopkins University and spent three decades working at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said he understands officials might be hesitant to impose harsher penalties more broadly, “for fear of the unintended consequences.”
“We live in a society where driving is really essential,” he said. But he said the findings show the agency needs more scrutiny and analysis of who is on the roads.
“These are not unresolvable problems,” he said.
Leah Shahum, executive director of the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit promoting safe streets, said sometimes officials prioritize preserving people’s ability to drive rather than ensuring safety.
“We don’t all have the right to drive,” Shahum said. “We have the responsibility to drive safely and ensure we don’t hurt others.” She added that many people need to drive in this car-centric state. “That does not mean there can be a license to kill.”
“If we know somebody has a history of dangerous behavior,” she said, “are we going to put that loaded gun back in their hands?”

The gun metaphor was common in the thousands of vehicular manslaughter cases we looked at across California. One prosecutor described dangerous behavior behind the wheel as akin to firing a gun into a crowd.
In letters to the court, surviving relatives and friends described the hole left behind, writing about an empty seat at a high school graduation, a photo cutout taken without fail to home baseball games.
It’s a void one young man tried to explain to authorities — the sudden, violent, blink-of-an-eye moment where life forever changes. For him, it was at 6:45 p.m. on Feb. 27, 2020, on Lone Tree Way in the Bay Area city of Antioch.
Two brothers, ages 11 and 15, were going to meet their dad at a Burger King. They crossed to the median and then waited for a break in the traffic before continuing to the other side. The older one made it across, according to court documents. His younger brother stepped into the street just as a driver gunned his car to 75 miles an hour — 30 over the speed limit.
The older boy watched as his younger brother “just disappeared.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-23 14:27:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Potential NIH cuts to Yale put New Haven biosciences tower at risk,Nathaniel Rosenberg | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/23/nih-yale-cuts-new-haven-biosciences-tower/,A planned biosciences office and lab tower will remain unbuilt as Yale pulls back  investments in light of possible federal funding cuts.,"The site of New Haven’s next planned biosciences office and lab tower will remain an empty lot for now — as Yale pulls back its biotech investments in light of possible federal funding cuts.
That’s the latest with the planned project on a surface parking lot on the former Coliseum site, now known as New Haven’s ​“10th Square.”
That lot was slated to hold a new 11-story lab and office building in addition to a recently opened apartment tower.
Mayor Justin Elicker shared the update on the bioscience development, which is being backed by British pension and insurance fund Legal & General (L&G), after a press conference at City Hall on Thursday morning.
“The NIH cuts have created so much uncertainty, and Yale potentially could have been a tenant in that building to help it have a long-term financial path,” he said. ​“And that’s on hold.”
[RELATED: Which Yale, UConn research projects had unspent NIH funds cut?]
In March 2023, Ancora Partners bought that 0.78-acre surface parking lot at the corner of South Orange Street and North Frontage Road for $10.6 million with plans to build a $230 million, 277,435-square-foot, 11-story Class A life sciences and tech tower. 
In January 2024, state and city officials gathered on the grave of the old New Haven Coliseum to announce that the state would be sending $1 million here to help the city’s newest biotech developer.
Not much has happened there since.
Developers initially predicted the building would open this year. However, according to Elicker, the building is still looking for tenants, and construction has not begun.
In February, the Trump administration announced a change capping the NIH’s coverage of ​“indirect costs” of research — things like lab infrastructure, utilities, and administrative staff — at 15 percent in the grants it hands out. The New York Times estimated the change could cost Yale $131 million in funding this year after the university received $602 million in NIH grants in 2024.
At the time, the administration defended the funding change as decreasing ​“administrative bloat” in favor of direct spending on research. Critics warned it could cripple scientific research nationwide. The cuts were blocked by a federal judge earlier this month, though the administration is appealing.
While Elicker said conversations between the university and real-estate development company Ancora are not final, he said there ​“was some optimism” that the university could rent space in the building.
A statement provided by a Yale spokesperson on behalf of Alexandra Daum, Yale’s associate vice president for New Haven Affairs, cited the uncertain federal funding landscape for pulling back from leasing space in the building.
“Yale had contemplated leasing a small amount of space in the proposed lab building at Square 10, but conversations with the developer were still conceptual and no specific deal had been reached,” Daum wrote. ​“Given the uncertainty in federal funding and the uncertainty expressed by Ancora about their ability to break ground on the building, it didn’t make sense to continue conversations about new leased lab space at this site.”
Ancora CEO Josh Parker deferred to L&G for comment, writing that the company is the lead on the project. L&G declined to comment.
Elicker said that the city will suffer as the university limits its development because of uncertainty around federal funding. 
“If development projects don’t happen, that’s millions of dollars of tax revenue lost to the city. That’s hundreds of jobs that would have happened that don’t happen,” he said. 
Blumenthal to Yale: Be like Harvard
Both Elicker and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal also took the opportunity last week to encourage Yale to fight back against possible federal funding cuts, citing Harvard University as a model to follow.
In recent months, the Trump administration has sent letters to several prominent universities demanding they accept a series of policy changes, including cutting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and agreeing to federal hiring audits, or lose billions in federal funding. Last week, Harvard became the first university to reject these demands, and on Monday, it sued the federal government over funding cuts.
So far, Yale has avoided the new administration’s spotlight. Yale’s new President, Maurie McInnis, has said that any response to federal funding cuts would be ​“context-dependent.”
“I hope Yale will join in supporting Harvard and in standing up itself for these values and principles,” Blumenthal said, adding he had spoken with McInnis about the issue.
Elicker echoed the senator, saying he thought Harvard’s response was a ​“very courageous” defense of academic freedom. He added that he was ​“optimistic” that McInnis would stand up to the Trump administration, noting that acquiescing had not helped Columbia University avoid funding cuts.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)FARGO, N.D. – Matt Perdue, government relations director for the North Dakota Farmers Union, on Tuesday told U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that staff cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture have farmers worried they won’t get the help they need in securing federal loans.
“Earlier this year, we had a farm loans webinar. That same webinar last year had 17 attendees. This year it had 107 and I think that is an indication of the financial stress and uncertainty out there,” Perdue said. “I think it also is an indication of how important FSA (Farm Service Agency) farm loans are for producers when times get tough.” 
Rollins, who held a roundtable discussion with farm groups in Fargo on Tuesday, said she understands the concerns as USDA shrinks its workforce but she tried to offer some reassurances.
She said USDA workers were told last week, “If you are FSA or frontline or with the farmers, you are not eligible to take early retirement.”

Rollins, invited by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., listened to the discussion from ag groups, state officials and North Dakota State University representatives at a gathering on the NDSU campus. She said it was her first visit to a land grant university.
Rollins announced during the event that USDA was releasing $340 million in disaster assistance for farmers and rural communities impacted by natural disasters.
The aid includes $5 million for North Dakota rural electric co-ops affected by wildfires during drought conditions last fall.
President Joe Biden had approved a major disaster declaration for North Dakota in December.
Rollins also repeated an announcement from last week of a new sugar tariff. She said that through Sept. 30, products with more than 65% sugar content will face an additional tariff of 33%.
“President Trump loves to deploy tariffs,” Rollins said. 
Rollins planned to visit a processing plant for sugar beets, a key specialty crop in the Red River Valley.
Tariffs, trade and how specialty crops might be treated in farm bill were among the topics covered. Specialty crops such as potatoes, dry beans and sunflowers are a big part of agriculture in North Dakota.
Congress has not been able to reach an agreement on a new farm bill, last year extending the previous version.
Gary Shields, executive director of the Northland Potato Growers Association, relayed a message from the National Potato Council about the possibility of specialty crops being left out of the next stopgap farm legislation.
“The big message is that specialty crop funding needs to be included,” Shields said.
On trade, North Dakota Agriculture Secretary Doug Goehring said the last four years have been disappointing for ag trade and the United States should “reengage with the world.”
Rollins said she could not believe how “stunningly bad” the United States was treated on the world stage.
Participants also emphasized the importance of decreasing regulation on farmers.
Ryan Ellis, a farmer and president of the North Dakota Grain Growers, described the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement of the Endangered Species Act to be “terrifying.”
Rollins was scheduled to get a closeup look at ag research at Grand Farm, a public-private collaboration west of Fargo near Casselton.

In a unanimous decision released Monday, a three-judge panel of the Minnesota Court of Appeals struck down a portion of a 2023 law designed to streamline the expungement process for evicted renters.
Under the provision in question, judges were mandated to expunge court records of eviction proceedings in cases in which the tenant has satisfied the terms of a settlement agreement.
In an opinion penned by Judge Peter Reyes, Jr., the appeals court criticized that requirement, saying that it “removes the district court’s discretion to determine whether expungement of its own records is appropriate and infringes on the judiciary’s inherent power to manage its own records.”
The ruling seems intended to protect the judiciary’s prerogatives against the encroachment of the Legislature.
“[The law] is contrary to standard court procedure, which allows the adverse party to object and the district court to decide the issue on the merits,” Reyes continued. “In essence, [it] precludes courts from considering the underlying facts of any case, considering the arguments raised by a party opposing expungement, making findings, or determining whether granting the expungement is in the best interests of society or the individual.”
The successful challenge was brought by St. Louis Park-based landlord Sela Investments, LTD, after a former tenant, identified only as “J.H.”, petitioned the Hennepin County District Court for expungement.
The details of that proceeding are scant because J.H.’s records have been expunged.
According to the briefs submitted to the appeals court, Sela commenced an eviction action against J.H. in December of 2023 over an unspecified violation of a lease. The following month, Sela and J.H. reached an agreement, and J.H. moved out by Jan. 31.
In June 2024, J.H. filed for expungement on the grounds that the agreement had been satisfied. Less than an hour later, a district court referee granted the motion and, within a few days, J.H.’s expungement was finalized by an order from the district court judge.
In a friend of the court brief, a coalition of 10 nonprofits that advocate for renters argued that the mandatory expungement provisions in the 2023 law provided vital protections from the harms that arise from having an eviction proceeding on one’s record. Overturning the law could create “grave consequences for tenants across Minnesota.”
Among other things, the advocates noted that evictions “disproportionately impact communities of color, women, victims of sexual and domestic violence, individuals with disabilities, and individuals receiving public housing assistance.”
The groups’ brief pointed to studies that showed an array of adverse health impacts arising in the wake of evictions, including worse birth outcomes for mothers and newborns, as well as significant increase in suicides.
In response, Christopher Kalla and Douglas Turner, Sela’s attorneys, wrote that the “parade of horribles” outlined by the renter advocates are “not unique to this appeal and the unconstitutionality” of the law. Kalla and Turner also argued that recent reforms to Minnesota’s renter-screening laws “provide relief to most, if not all, of the examples identified by the Intervenor.”
In its ruling, the appeals court sent J.H. ‘s expungement request back to Hennepin County District Court for consideration under a separate provision of the eviction expungement law. Under that standard, the court can order expungement in the interest of justice when “those interests are not outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing about the record.”
J.H.’s attorney, Elizabeth Frazier of the Minnesota Assistance Council for Veterans, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rentcontrol-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 11:12:07.946929

Photo by Neal Goswami/VTDiggerUpdated at 4:33 p.m.BURLINGTON — Lawyers for Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist arrested in Vermont last week, argued in federal court Wednesday that the Upper Valley resident had been unlawfully detained by federal immigration authorities and should be released.  “Mohsen Mahdawi sits in a jail cell,” Luna Droubi, one of his attorneys, said at the hearing, “because of his lawful speech.”Mahdawi, a student organizer at Columbia University and a lawful U.S. resident for a decade, was arrested by federal agents in Colchester during an interview as part of his U.S. citizenship naturalization process.At that meeting, Mahdawi affirmed his commitment to “defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign, and domestic,” according to court filings submitted by his attorneys. But afterward, an immigration official told Mahdawi he needed to “‘check’ on some information,” and “ICE agents, masked and visibly armed, entered the interview room and shackled” Mahdawi, according to the filing. The federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle and attempted to get him on a plane en route to Louisiana, his lawyers have said. But Mahdawi’s attorneys quickly filed a lawsuit, and a judge issued a temporary order to keep him in Vermont. He was later detained at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, where he continues to be held.Protestors gathered outside federal court in Burlington to support Mohsen Mahdawi on Wednesday, April 23. Photo by Neal Goswami/VTDiggerAttorneys for Mahdawi have argued he was detained in retaliation for promoting Palestinian rights and opposing Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. They also cited a memo written by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio — reported by the New York Times — that argued the Columbia student’s activism could “potentially undermine” Middle East peace talks.The federal government, meanwhile, has said Mahdawi should be removed from the country because his presence “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest,” citing Secretary Rubio, according to court documents. On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford extended for 90 days the temporary restraining order that forces the government to keep Mahdawi in Vermont. Crawford also said he intended to schedule a hearing for next Wednesday, where he might rule on whether the federal government can continue detaining Mahdawi. “I recognize the urgency,” Crawford said at the hearing, adding that he needed to give the federal government the opportunity to file further arguments. “I wish we could do it today, but I don’t think that would be fair for the government.”Sal Millichamp, center, of Burlington attends a protest outside of the federal court in Burlington on Wednesday, April 23. Photo by Neal Goswami/VTDiggerAsked by the judge about the temporary restraining order keeping Mahdawi in Vermont, acting U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher, who represented President Donald Trump’s administration, said he was “not authorized” to consent to extending the order. And regarding Mahdawi’s continued detention, Drescher argued that immigration court rather than federal district court had jurisdiction over the issue. In turn, Mahdawi’s lawyers argued that an immigration court wasn’t the proper venue to rule on the constitutional violations against free speech they allege.Considering Mahdawi’s continued detention or release, Crawford, the judge, referenced the circumstances of his arrest in Colchester.Photo by Neal Goswami/VTDiggerThe federal government wouldn’t have sent a “cavalcade of SUVs” and a “posse of agents” unless “they had something in mind,” he said without elaborating. Asked by the judge about his treatment in a Vermont prison, Mahdawi told the court that “people have been very kind.” Following the hearing, as he exited the crowded courtroom, he extended two peace signs to the full benches of friends and family. Outside the courthouse, hundreds of supporters rallied to call for the Vermont resident’s release, and for the freedom of the Palestinian people. Nora Rubinstein, of Middletown Springs, said she was inspired to attend Wednesday to defend “democracy and freedom” and help the U.S. “return to the democratic principles this country was founded on.”“It’s time to end the shredding of our democracy, the shredding of our Constitution,” Rubinstein said.Following the hearing, Mahdawi’s legal team addressed the press and the gathered crowd, calling the morning a “victory” and stressing the case’s importance for all immigrants in the United States.“We are very hopeful that he will be released,” Cyrus Mehta, one of Mahdawi’s lawyers, said. “The judge wants to move quickly, and he realizes that this is a case of great importance for this country.”Mahdawi faces a separate case in immigration court in Louisiana, according to court filings from his lawyers, where they allege federal immigration authorities had a “clear plan to ship him.”Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, visited Mahdawi in the St. Albans prison, sharing a video of their conversation on social media. In the recording, the detained Vermonter told supporters he was in “good hands” and “staying positive.”Court filings indicate Mahdawi was set to graduate from Columbia University next month and intends to pursue a master’s degree from the school as well. While a student there, Mahdawi co-founded the Palestinian Student Union, according to his attorneys.In a statement shared by his lawyers Wednesday, Mahdawi encouraged the public to remain hopeful. “This hearing is part of the system of democracy. It prevents a tyrant from having unchecked power,” he said. “A system of democracy guarantees freedom of speech. Speaking of Palestine does not only qualify as freedom of speech, but it is also about our humanity.”Neal Goswami contributed reporting. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mohsen Mahdawi, detained Vermonter and Palestinian activist, appears in federal court.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mahdawi-protest-1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An estimated 187,000 Kansas school-age children could have received free summer meals last year — their families just didn’t submit the application.
Of the 193,000 potential applications estimated by the United States Department of Agriculture for the SUN Bucks program, according to the Kansas Department for Children and Families, there were 5,645 submitted — only 3%. The program, also known as the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer program, gives families a $120 summer grocery card per eligible school-age child.


How to apply for SUN Bucks 
Application is open now through Aug. 29, 2025.
Families who did not receive a letter from the Kansas Department for Children and Families in January can check their eligibility.
Families should apply through the DCF Self-service portal.


While most eligible children did not receive the SUN Bucks, 59,265 families  automatically received them, according to DCF. The number of families who automatically received benefits were not counted into the 193,000 potential applications. Children in a household that had already submitted paperwork to receive free or reduced-price school lunches or applied for monthly food assistance programs, for example, were auto-enrolled. Families auto-enrolled for this summer received a letter in January.
The majority of states that offer SUN Bucks auto-enroll children in Medicaid. Kansas does not.
Haley Kottler, campaign director for food access at Kansas Appleseed, says DCF can’t auto-enroll children on Medicaid because of capacity issues with its internal system.
“If systems were integrated and updated, approximately 60,000 more eligible children could be auto-enrolled in SUN Bucks,” Kottler said.
 
Why were applications so low? 
After federal funding was approved, families had from Aug. 12, 2024, to Oct. 15, 2024, to apply. This year, families have from Jan. 27 to Aug. 29 to apply — enlarging the window from two to seven months.
Kottler identified the small timespan as a reason for the low number of applications. The original application deadline was Sept. 11, 2024, and Kottler fought to change it. But she said that even with the extended window, applications didn’t increase.
“It made it really challenging, because a lot of families just didn’t know they were able to utilize this benefit,” Kottler said.
Erin LaRow, a spokeswoman for DCF, said her department spread the word via social media campaigns, messaging within the DCF phone system and self-service portal, a dedicated webpage and a statewide news release.
The department also shared a fact sheet, both in English and Spanish, with the Kansas State Department of Education.
David Rubel, a New York City-based education consultant, looked at 12 states’ potential number of applications vs applications submitted. He found the percentage of applications submitted in every state was less than 20%.
North Carolina had the highest results, with 19.3% of applications submitted, followed by Missouri, with 18.3%. He said the comparatively robust numbers are because of communication about the SUN Bucks program from school districts.
“It’s all about the school districts getting the word out to their families. And why I emphasize the school districts is because they’re the only ones who have the current contact information for the families,” Rubel said.
Amber Wheeler, the superintendent of Humboldt School District — which has 33% of students approved for free and reduced-price lunches — said it has posted a DCF infographic on their social media accounts.
Robin Button, the food and service director for Fort Scott School District — with 56.7% of students approved for free and reduced-price lunches — said it plans on posting the infographic and mentioning the program at its town hall.
 
‘Chilling effect’ of recent politics
In the wake of President Donald Trump’s promise to deport more people — and the use of federal documents to identify them — immigrant families are wary of submitting more documentation. While the Kansas DCF website states that receiving SUN Bucks would not affect a family’s immigration status, fear remains.
“There’s a chilling effect when it comes to programs like this,” Kottler said. “It’s absolutely causing them fear and to not apply.”
Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk have been pushing spending cuts — a crusade that has trickled down to state-level officials. At the Kansas State Board of Education meeting on April 8, the board nearly cut the Public Education Partnership, which informs parents of the summer meals offered to them. The partnership was saved by one vote.
In the 2025-2026 Kansas legislative session, Republicans attempted to insert a provision in the budget that would ban the use of SUN Bucks on candy or soda. Democratic Governor Laura Kelly vetoed the provision — and while the Senate overturned her veto, the House did not — ultimately upholding her veto.
LaRow with DCF said the department has received 1,294 SUN Bucks applications as of April 11.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_2169-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-23 10:14:17.438528

Renewable energy has been embraced in much of rural Alaska as an alternative to expensive diesel-fueled power. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)In a political environment where the president and his administration are pushing for more fossil fuel development and scorning alternative energy, Alaska’s senior U.S. senator is defending renewable projects in the rural areas of her state.
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, speaking at an Anchorage conference on Tuesday, recounted her efforts to convince Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that wind, solar and other sources of renewable energy are valuable even in oil-producing Alaska.
In a phone call Monday that lasted more than an hour and in which Burgum reiterated the administration’s support for more extraction of oil, gas and coal and its opposition to wind energy, Murkowski said she made a pitch for renewable projects in Alaska that were previously awarded grants but are now in limbo because of Trump administration funding freezes.
“We’re coming to the department and saying, ‘I know that you put on pause funding for clean energy resources. If you don’t like the vernacular that we’re using, that’s fine, but look at it from the perspective of energy independence for these small communities and what independence means and looks like for them,’” Murkowski said at the Alaska Infrastructure Development Symposium.
The three-day symposium is sponsored by the state, the Alaska Municipal League, the Alaska Federation of Natives and other organizations.
Murkowski urged conference attendees to help educate officials from the Department of the Interior and other federal departments about rural Alaska communities’ situations. Unlike communities in the Lower 48 states, rural Alaska communities are unconnected to larger energy grids and often struggle with expensive and difficult-to-store diesel fuel, making renewables a practical alternative, she noted.
Even a long-desired natural gas pipeline megaproject from Alaska’s North Slope, which President Donald Trump and others are enthusiastically backing, would not do much to help rural Alaska communities that lie outside of any large power grid.
“It’s not going to do a spur out to Togiak. It’s not going to do a spur out to Kobuk,” Murkowski said, naming a Yup’ik village in Western Alaska and an Inupiat village in Northwest Alaska. “So I said, ‘Please, please don’t forget the opportunities that come to our more rural communities that are more isolated who need to be able to access those resources that are there. And those resources may be a little bit of wind, it may be a little bit of solar, it may be a little bit of the of the run of river, it may be a little bit of geothermal.’”
Murkowski’s defense of renewable energy comes as hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of planned rural Alaska projects are in doubt because of Trump administration actions. The administration has frozen much of the infrastructure funding that was awarded during the Biden administration, including funding for renewable energy development.

	Last month, the Alaska Public Interest Research Group said it had calculated that over $1 billion of Alaska energy and other infrastructure projects were affected. As a result, some local governments, tribes and other organizations have delayed planned projects because they are uncertain about reimbursement. Such delays in rural Alaska can put projects at least a year behind schedule because construction work depends on delivery of heavy equipment and material by barges that can travel only in ice-free conditions
As of yet, there has been little clarity on which projects will actually get funded and which will have to be canceled, said Murkowski and municipal officials attending the symposium.
Murkowski said at least a couple of Trump administration department secretaries are planning trips to Alaska in June, and that might present an educational opportunity. She did not specify which cabinet members may be visiting.
Trump has been dismissive of renewable energy and, in particular, hostile to wind energy for several years. He has claimed, without evidence, that wind turbines cause cancer, drastically depress property values and kill massive numbers of whales. His disdain for wind energy dates back at least to 2012, when he fought unsuccessfully against a wind farm off the coast of a golf course he owned in Scotland.
One of his Inauguration Day executive orders earlier this year halted federal funding and permitting for all wind projects, both offshore and onshore.
Wind energy has been important to rural Alaska communities, where diesel-fueled energy costs are extremely high.
Kotzebue, a mostly Inupiat community, is an example. The Northwest Arctic hub, home to about 3,000 people, has been using wind energy since the 1990s. The system has grown over the years, and by 2020, wind was supplying a fifth of annual local power needs, according to the Kotzebue Electric Association. That displaced the annual need for 250,000 to 300,000 gallons of diesel fuel each year, according to the utility.
The community has also been using solar energy since 2020, and it has a longer-term goal of using renewables for 50% of its power, according to the utility.
Kotzebue, the Northwest Arctic Borough and several surrounding villages are among the communities with planned energy projects that have been paused because of Trump administration actions. Last year, during the Biden administration, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded $58.4 million in grants to local governments and other entities in the region to develop more solar arrays, an energy-storing battery system, heat pumps and other projects.

Delaware Secretary of Education Cindy Marten has appointed two seasoned education officials to help lead the state through its most significant school funding reform in over seven decades.
Denise Carter has been named Deputy Secretary for Strategic Initiatives, while Adam Schott will serve as Associate Secretary for Student Support.
The appointments mark Marten’s first senior hires since taking office and come as the state prepares to implement a student-centered funding formula aimed at improving equity and outcomes across public schools.
“The shift to a student-centered funding formula is a top priority for our Administration, and I have been impressed with the dramatic progress the Public Education Finance Committee is making in that direction, under the leadership of State Sen. Laura Sturgeon,” said Secretary Marten. “The appointment of Deputy Secretary Carter and Associate Secretary Schott will ensure our department is prepared to help schools implement the final program approved by the Legislature and signed by Governor Meyer.”
Carter brings more than 30 years of experience in federal operations, most recently leading key modernization efforts at the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid office.

Her leadership played a pivotal role in the rollout of the revamped 2025-2026 Free Application for Federal Student Aid, benefiting around 17 million students nationwide.
Carter previously oversaw core functions at the Department of Education, including finance, acquisitions, and human resources. She is a recipient of the Meritorious Presidential Rank Award.
Schott, a longtime advocate for education equity, has held senior roles in the Pennsylvania Department of Education and served on the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.
Most recently, he worked as the principal deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, helping to distribute $122 billion in pandemic relief funds under the American Rescue Plan. Schott also brings local experience from his time as a school board member in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Both appointees are expected to play a crucial role as Delaware finalizes its funding formula overhaul—a process gaining momentum under the leadership of State Senator Laura Sturgeon and the Public Education Finance Committee.

Wes Moore (D) signed a suite of justice reform bills into law Tuesday that will make it easier for long-serving inmates to apply for parole, make age and illness a factor in parole considerations and streamline the process for people seeking to expunge their records after serving their time.
The bills, some of which advocates have been pushing for years, demonstrate what House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) called the legislature’s ongoing efforts “to create a more equitable criminal justice system” in state that “incarcerates the highest percentage of Black people in the country.”
“So this year, we passed several bills to address these statistics, including the Second Look Act, the governor’s Expungement Reform Act, and legislation to improve the mcdical parole process,” Jones said at Tuesday’s bill-signing, the second since the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Jones, Moore and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) signed 142 bills into law Tuesday. They also included a measure aimed at protecting federal workers from Trump administration budget cuts and another aimed at protecting the state from the potentially crushing financial burden of lawsuits brought by people who were abused as children while in state custody, after a then-hailed change state law made it easier to bring such suits.
Moore touted Senate Bill 432, the Expungement Reform Act, which was part of his legislative agenda. Advocates say that criminal records can prevent people from getting jobs, loans or housing, no matter how long ago the crime was committed, but that the process expunging a criminal record can be cumbersome and sometimes impossible.

“We know, that for too many Marylanders, their criminal record … is tied around their necks for the rest of life. They cannot get a loan, they cannot get a home, they cannot get hired and ofentimes it’s because of an offense that they committed years, if not decades ago,” Moore said. “We have got to confront this myth that every sentence needs to be a life sentence.”
SB432 expands the current list of more than crimes for which a person may seek expungement to include credit card theft, making a false statement to police and driving without a license, among others. It also corrects a technicality that made parole violations count against the successful fulfillment of a person’s sentence, effectively barring someone permanently from seeking expungment if they violated parole somewhere along the way.
“As soon as the bill becomes effective, I think you’re going to see some impact,” said Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County), a co-sponsor of the act. “Right after the effective date, people that wouldn’t have been helped the day before are going to be helped so, there’s going to be immediate action.”
Officials also signed into law measures aimed at giving people still serving time a shot at getting out on parole. Those measures were often the subject of emotional debate during the legislative session, and sometimes surprising personal stories from lawmakers talking about their own experiences as victims of crime.
House Bill 853, the Second Look Act, would give people who have been incarcerated for at least 20 years the ability to petition for a sentence reduction if they met several other criteria. It would not be available to sex offenders, people sentenced to life without chance of parole, those who were older than 25 when they committed or those convicted of killing a first responder.
The last criterion was one of a series of disqualifying crimes that opponents of the bill offered as amendments, all of which failed except for the first responder amendment. It as accepted by the Senate in the waning days of the legislative session, threatening to derail the bill, but the House accepted the change and gave final approval to the bill after years of trying by advocates.
Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County) said at the time that she was not a fan of the amendment, but willing to accept to get the Second Look Act on the books.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It’s just a good and promising start,” Pasteur said after Tuesday’s bill signing. She predicts that the bill will do more than help the incarcerated individuals who might have their sentences shortened, but will benefit communities as well. “For those that come out, just think of how they can positively interact with the young people.”
Critics had argued, some passionately, that allowing inmates to petition for a sentence reduction would deny justice to the victims, and force them to relive the crimes again years later. They argued that people who had committed particulary heinous crimes did not deserve a second chance.
But supporters of the bill said repeatedly that it is not a “get out of jail free” card, but just a chance to recognize inmates who have turned their lives around and might be able to contribute to society. The petitions are reviewed by judges in the courts that convicted an individual, and an incarcerated individual who is turned down would have to wait three years to reapply. Inmates would only be able to petition three times.
Pasteur called the signing “an incredible day” and said she has formed a committee to “monitor … everybody that comes out under this bill” to measure its impact.
Sydnor recognized the opposition to the bill, but said he believes it will be a positive overall.
“There are some people, I believe, may not see the utility in doing things like this. But I believe in grace and the Second Chance bill,” he said.
He could not explain the sudden success of justice reform measures, some of which advocates have been pushing for years.
“A lot of work by a lot of people … No one legislator by his or herself,” he said, acknowledging lawmakers in the past who worked steadily on the measures.” This happened to be the year. everything came together, just people in the right places at the right time.”

Also signed into law yesterday were House Bill 1123 and Senate Bill 181, which would require parole hearings for long-serving inmates over age 60 and for those with severe medical conditions.
Almost lost in the rush of justice reform bills was House Bill 1424, the Protect Our Federal Workers Act, which was sponsored by Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) after the scale of budget and job cuts planned by President Donald Trump started to become evident.
The bill would take a current state fund that has been used to help federal workers get over any hurdles from a temporary government shutdown, and would shift that into a new fund that would be used to help. federal workers who permanently lose their jobs because of administration budget cuttig. The Federal Government Employee Assistance Loan Fund would be buttressed with $5 million from the state’s Rainy Day Fund.
The bill als gives the Office of the Attorney General new authority to defend federal employees, or take legal action on their behalf because of federal government shutdowns, firings, office relocations or agency closures.
With 160,000 federal government jobs in the state, and 260,000 federal workers living in the state, Moore said “these are our people” and must be defended. His administration has said that weaning the state away from its reliance on the federal government is one of its economic goals.
Jones said the bill would “fight back against chaos and hostility caused by the Trump administration.”
“We knew from Day One that Donald Trump would be coming after our federal workers,” Jones said. “We recognize that we might not be able to beat the federal government when it comes to job loss or funding cuts or immigration, but …. that doesn’t mean that we are going to stop fighting.
“With that, let’s protect Marylanders and let’s sign these bills,” she said to applause.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0251-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-23 10:14:17.438528

Mike Kehoe speaks during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol Feb. 26 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe vowed during his annual State of the State address in January to rewrite the foundation formula, the equation that determines how the state funds public schools.
Almost three months later, he has yet to announce his selections for a task force charged with reviewing public school funding and recommending changes.
The School Funding Modernization Task Force is his solution to what he sees as a stagnant, dysfunctional formula. The task force aims to rewrite the formula which has not been substantively revised in 20 years.
Gabby Picard, spokesperson for the governor, told the Missourian that Kehoe’s appointees will be announced in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, the legislature has nominated four members to serve on the committee that will reengineer how schools receive state funding.
In late February, House Speaker Jon Patterson appointed Reps. Marlene Terry, a Democrat from St. Louis, and Ed Lewis, a Republican from Moberly.
Terry was the first Black member of the Riverview Gardens School Board, where she served in various leadership positions for nine years, including school board president.
Lewis worked as a high school educator for 32 years prior to being elected to the House in 2020. He is vice chair of the House subcommittee for education appropriations.
Lewis said he has yet to receive communication from Kehoe about his fellow appointees and the task force’s timeline. He forecasts the team will be set in motion in a few weeks, near the end of the legislative session.
“It’s going to be a lot of work and a lot of time,” Lewis said. “I don’t think you’re going to make everybody happy because of the nature of this beast.”
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin appointed Sens. Rusty Black, a Republican from Chillicothe, and Travis Fitzwater, a Republican from Holts Summit.
Black spent 33 years as an agriculture educator before being elected to the Senate in 2022.
Fitzwater has a background in local politics, small businesses and youth ministry. He and his wife homeschool their three children.
O’Laughlin expressed her support for the task force, telling the Missourian an update to the school funding formula was “long overdue.”
According to his executive order creating the task force, Kehoe will appoint a superintendent from a large urban school and one from a small rural school, a teacher, a representative for charter schools, an advocate for school choice and representatives from the business and agricultural sectors.
The Missouri State Board of Education will appoint its own representative.
 Missouri educators

The spot reserved for a teacher is not further outlined. The executive order does not detail if the educator is to be from a public, private or charter school, their level of experience or the grades they teach.
Todd Fuller, spokesman for the Missouri State Teacher’s Association, said he feels the appointed teacher should come from a public school.
“School teachers and public school teachers find themselves underrepresented in these situations,” Fuller said. “I don’t think that’s ultimately beneficial to the formula that’s created or to the makeup of teachers in our state.”
Public school teachers make up the majority of the state’s education workforce: 72,000 teachers serve more than 870,000 students in Missouri’s public schools.
“If we’re not representing public school teachers then we’re not reprinting the largest part of the workforce in our state for education and for public education,” Fuller said.
Per state law, funds received through the formula must be used primarily to pay teachers’ salaries.
 Urban and rural representation

The executive order mandates representatives from the business and agriculture sectors be included in the task force.
Fuller explained the inclusion of these representatives may be an effort to align the formula with the interests of Missouri’s rural and urban districts.
Seventy percent of school districts in the state are categorized as rural, but combined, these districts serve just 21% of the state’s students, according to a study from St. Louis University.
The foundation formula aims to factor in cost of living in school districts. In the equation, this is referred to as the dollar value modifier.
This modifier provides additional funds to school districts located in areas with a higher cost of living without restricting funds to districts with lower costs of living.
To do so, cost of living is determined by dividing the average wage per job of the district’s area by the state’s median wage. Wages act as a proxy to determine an individual purchasing power in the area.
The formula also considers the amount of funds contributed by the district’s local community, primarily through property tax.
Districts that are located in areas with higher home values, thus generating more property tax, typically receive less state funding.
Rural districts usually receive more state funding due to their smaller tax base than populous, urban districts.
The current property tax model is frozen at 2005 levels — an attempt to hold the amount of funding a district receives steady as tax rates fluctuate yearly.
The freeze is a part of the formula’s “hold-harmless” provision. Since 2007, roughly 200 of the state’s 518 districts are ensured to receive at least the amount of funding they did in the 2005-06 school year.
 Limited funding

Over the past 20 years, Missouri’s spending on public education has increased as a dollar amount, but it has shrunk in proportion to total spending.
Kehoe proposed a $200 million increase in funding for the foundation formula, bringing the total to more than $4 billion for fiscal year 2026.
The proposed increase falls short of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s suggested increase of $500 million.
The legislature is in the final stages of settling on fiscal year 2026 funding for the state. Senate leaders last week announced plans to fully fund the foundation formula, despite Kehoe’s decision, endorsed by the House, to leave $300 million out of the proposed budget for public schools. A final resolution on the spending will be made by May 9.
David Luther, spokesman for the Missouri Association of School Administrators, said his team is in a “wait-and-see pattern” as the task force is put together.
“To see any kind of major changes would be certainly cause for us to face some different challenges, so we’re hopeful that the folks over at the Capitol building can take a look at this and find alternative means to make sure that the foundation formula is fully funded,” he said.
The state education department is requesting the money in part to level the state adequacy target — a key multiplier in the foundation formula. The state adequacy target is the minimum amount of funding a student needs to meet basic state requirements.
“The target is kind of the heart of the foundation formula,” Lewis said. “Having an outside entity or department being able to, by rules they promulgate, change that drastically by one year is definitely one issue about the foundation formula that needs to be addressed.
The target is set at $7,145 by the formula for the 2026 fiscal year, but the House adjusted the figure to $6,760.
House Democrats’ attempts to raise the target were voted down. The Senate decision to add the money means a compromise will need to be worked out between the two chambers.
The task force must submit its final report with recommendations for the new funding model to Kehoe by Dec. 1, 2026.

When people can’t get where they need to go, barriers to basic needs like education, employment, and health care persist.
The post Transportation insecurity is holding Massachusetts residents back appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MASSACHUSETTS ALWAYS ranks high in national survey categories for education, health care, and technology. The Commonwealth has a lot to be proud of, but we have glaring deficiencies in other areas such as income inequality, cost of living, childcare, and housing. We also consistently receive poor marks for traffic congestion and infrastructure.  This year, we again ranked 4th worst for traffic in the country according to INRIX, and the American Society of Civil Engineers gives Massachusetts a C grade for infrastructure. The Commonwealth should prioritize Investments in communities with the most persistent barriers to transportation to address congestion, public health and safety, and access to opportunities. Traffic and infrastructure improvements take time, investment, and intentional planning to fix roads and bridges, improve transit, and reduce congestion. All of these factors play an important role in the everyday lives of Massachusetts’s residents and how they go about their daily lives.  A recent Transportation for Massachusetts (T4MA) survey shows that 69 percent of residents believe that the transportation system in the Commonwealth is either in poor or fair condition.   These numbers show we have work to do to help residents access essential services, commute to work or school, and stay connected to family and friends. It’s easy to look at poll numbers and try to extrapolate what they mean for everyday residents, but Transportation for Massachusetts and the MassINC Polling Group also tried to focus on the lived experience of the residents in the Commonwealth by asking about transportation insecurity. The Transportation Security Index, modeled after the Poverty Index, developed at the University of Michigan, is a validated survey instrument composed of items that focus on the symptoms of transportation insecurity (for example, taking a long time to plan out everyday trips, or rescheduling appointments).  The Transportation for Massachusetts survey asked residents about their transportation insecurity and found that the results here are no better than national averages. Nationally, about 1 in 4 adults experience transportation insecurity. In Massachusetts, the T4MA poll found that 36 percent of residents report some level of transportation insecurity. That means people experience anything between constrained travel or severe travel limitations. The number rises to 46 percent in Suffolk County. This translates to the inability to access opportunities like jobs or education, or missing health care appointments or relying on friends or family to get around. In all, 29 percent of respondents said that they skipped going somewhere in the past 30 days because of a lack of transportation. Those who experience the greatest transportation insecurity are non-white residents, under 30 years old, and making less than $50,000. When people can’t get where they need to go, barriers to basic needs like education, employment, and health care persist. When policymakers are prioritizing how we spend transportation dollars in the Commonwealth, we hope they think beyond the physical infrastructure and focus on people — on how people need real access.  This means safe roadways to protect pedestrians and cyclists, robust funding for public transportation, and funding for innovative transportation solutions like on-demand or demand-response microtransit in areas without other options.  By viewing our funding priorities through the lens of those on the margins, not only will we break down barriers for those who experience transportation insecurity, but we will be able to equitably improve our transportation systems for everyone. Pete Wilson is senior policy director at Transportation for Massachusetts.The post Transportation insecurity is holding Massachusetts residents back appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Turnpike-traffic-commuter-rail.jpg?fit=1024%2C697&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

The money went towards a super political action committee (PAC), which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, named Your City Your Future.Super PACs are expected to play a large role in this election cycle, as political operatives consider them more impactful at the local level. While donors are limited to contributing $1,000 to a candidate’s campaign committee in a calendar year, super PACs offer the opportunity to donate a larger sum. Super PACs operate with fewer restrictions, though they cannot coordinate with the campaign of the candidate they are supporting.Davis’s donation was by far the largest received by the pro-Kraft super PAC, which also took in six-figure sums from Robert Hale, the CEO of Quincy-based Granite Telecommunications, who donated $100,000, and John J. Calnan, CEO of a construction management company also based in Quincy, who gave$150,000. Marc Casper, the CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific, the state’s largest medical device company, donated $10,000. Spokespeople for the donors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The $1 million figure is a little less than Davis spent in all of 2021, the last mayoral election cycle, which featured Wu and another city councilor, Annissa Essaibi George. Davis poured nearly $1.1 million into a different super PAC after a private meeting with Essaibi George, inside his Brighton warehouse full of classic cars. Essaibi George was considered to be the more conservative mayoral candidate, while Wu is a progressive mentored by US Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Davis, 81, has donated millions of dollars over the last 20 years to Massachusetts Democrats and Republicans, according to a review of campaign finance records, as well as nearly $400,000 to Donald Trump in 2016. In the last few municipal election cycles, he has focused on backing moderate to conservative candidates.The Kraft super PAC is run by Rebecca St. Amand, an attorney at Vicente LLP, a law firm specializing in the cannabis industry. She did not respond to a request for comment.The super PAC’s campaign finance filing also included one expenditure: $100,000 for digital advertising, sent to a just-formed company run by Jonathan Karush, who has ties to Keyser Public Strategies, a company that is advising Kraft’s mayoral campaign. Eileen O’Connor, a partner at Keyser Public Strategies, is a board member of MassINC, the nonprofit that publishes CommonWealth Beacon.The Kraft super PAC has set up a Facebook site, with posts taking aim at planned school closures and the installation of bike lanes, which Kraft has also criticized while on the campaign trail.The Kraft campaign declined comment, but one of its advisers, Will Keyser, said in February they would not wave off super PAC support, as Essaibi George unsuccessfully attempted in 2021.Kraft, one of the sons of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, has already pulled in $733,000 in donations, much of the haul coming from the Boston region’s business sector, since he launched his campaign in February.Wu, who has nearly $2 million in cash on hand, is expected to see support from super PACs, too, as she did during the last mayoral election, when the money came from environmental groups and lawyers.Bold Boston, a super PAC that backed Wu’s slate of City Council candidates in 2023, received $100,000 from the 1199 SEIU health care workers union days after the union endorsed her in March.In 2021, Wu urged super PACs to stay positive, and she sounded a similar note when asked about super PACs at her campaign kickoff several weeks ago in Boston’s South End.“All signs are that there will be a lot of resources poured into this race,” Wu told reporters. “I hope that they will not be entirely focused on amplifying negative and false narratives about our city and the people who live here. But we’ve already seen some of that happening and I intend to make sure that the truth of Boston, who we are and what we stand for, remains front and center throughout the race.”The post New Balance chairman drops $1 million on Josh Kraft super PAC appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jim-Davis-New-Balance-and-Marty-Walsh-Mayors-Office-photo.jpg?fit=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Photo courtesy of New Energy EquitiesThe Minnesota Senate advanced a DFL-sponsored bill earlier this month that would sunset the state’s pathbreaking community solar program in 2028 and significantly reduce the financial benefits of onsite solar for utility customers in small towns, rural areas and exurban communities across the state.
The bill would also sunset Minnesota’s Renewable Development Account, which uses millions in annual nuclear waste storage fees paid by Xcel Energy to subsidize residential solar panel installations.
Environmental and clean energy advocates assailed the bill in a press conference at the Capitol last week.
“This bill is a betrayal of Minnesota’s climate promises” and the product of “backroom deals (that) are handing our future to polluters,” said Steve Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership.
The package represents a stark change in state energy policy from 2023, when lawmakers passed sweeping legislation that expanded the community solar program, boosted solar incentives for low-income customers and mandated that Minnesota generate 100% of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.
“Community solar gardens power 30,000 Minnesotans, create local jobs, and save people money, especially renters, low-income households and public interest institutions like schools, hospitals and counties. All of this makes it the largest and most equitable form of solar in the state,” said Pouya Najmaie, policy and regulatory director for Cooperative Energy Futures, a solar nonprofit.
Other provisions in the bill could weaken Minnesota’s clean electricity standard by defining some power plants that burn wood waste and biodiesel as carbon-free, advocates said. The bill would also define new, larger hydroelectric dams as potential sources of carbon-free electricity, a change from the 2023 law.
The Senate bill has enthusiastic support from the Minnesota Rural Electric Association, which represents 50 nonprofit rural electric cooperatives serving 1.7 million Minnesotans.
For more than 40 years, Minnesota customers with their own solar arrays have been eligible to receive a credit on their bill for electricity they contribute to the grid, under a framework known as net metering. The Senate bill would eliminate that option for systems in electric cooperative and municipal utility territories that apply for grid connections after Dec. 31, 2026, and instead set compensation using a less generous “avoided cost” standard. 
Existing solar installations in electric co-op and municipal utility territories would not be affected. Nor would existing or future systems in territories served by public utilities like Xcel Energy or Minnesota Power. But any co-op or municipal utility customer who wants to install solar after next year would be compensated at the new, lower rate.
The change could encourage smaller Minnesota power companies to speed up deployment of larger solar facilities ahead of the 2040 deadline, the Rural Electric Association said earlier this month.
“Utilities can purchase the same energy at about half the cost by buying or building systems at utility scale. And that means we can get twice as much carbon reduction for the same price,” MREA CEO Darrick Moe said in an April 7 statement. 
In an interview this week, Moe said the net metering change is MREA’s biggest legislative priority this session. From MREA’s perspective, the state needs to get out in front of a potential rapid rise in demand for smaller, less cost-effective solar systems, he said. In other words, without a change, MREA says, the good deal offered to those rooftop solar consumers would push costs up for everyone else.
Sunny California is the poster child for this “cost-shift,” according to Moe. He cited a University of California analysis that blamed residential rooftop solar — which produces about 20% of the electricity consumed by residential customers of its three major public utilities — for shifting $4 billion to other customers’ bills. That works out to between 9% and 22% of the retail electricity price, depending on the utility.
John Farrell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Najmaie of Cooperative Energy Futures and more than a dozen other environmental and energy equity advocates disputed the concept of cost-shifting in an April 4 letter to Minnesota legislators.
Retail-rate compensation “is a fair and straightforward policy since the power delivered to the grid is used by their neighbor and that neighbor is then charged retail for that power by the utility. The utility then credits the solar owner who provided the power that same amount. There is no cost shift,” they wrote.
The Senate bill wouldn’t deter electric co-op and municipal utility customers from installing solar to meet their own energy needs, but rather disincentivize “oversized systems” designed to benefit from the current net metering framework, Moe said. In other words, some customers set up systems that produce far more power than they need with the intent of selling electricity back to the utility.
“What we’re looking for here is really a modest change,” Moe said.
One rural net metering beneficiary had a different take at the Capitol press conference. 
“There’s no way I would have even considered (solar) had I thought net metering was going to be history,” said Carmen Fernholz, who spent $160,000 to add solar last year on his 450-acre organic farm in western Minnesota. 
If the net metering change passes, “Solar in rural and small town Minnesota would all but stop,” said Bobby King, Solar United Neighbors Minnesota director in an email.
With about a month left to go in this year’s legislative session, the energy omnibus bill likely isn’t yet in final form, so the fate of the net metering change, community solar sunset and other individual items remains uncertain. And House Democrats, who share control of the lower chamber, may be less supportive of those provisions, Moe said.
But “being in the Senate omnibus means (the net metering provision) is a live bipartisan issue for end-of-session negotiation,” he said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Clara-City-CSG-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-23 10:14:17.438528

A CalMatters investigation of facilities emitting methyl bromide in Los Angeles County has found that local air quality officials won’t be monitoring the air or taking any immediate steps to protect people in nearby homes and schools.
As Alejandra Reyes-Velarde explains, methyl bromide is a highly toxic gas used to kill pests on imported produce. California health officials have classified the chemical as a reproductive toxicant, which means it can harm developing babies in the womb. High levels of short-term exposure can cause headaches and nausea, while exposure lasting a year or more can lead to neurological effects such as learning and memory difficulties.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has reported that five fumigation facilities in Long Beach, Compton and the L.A. neighborhood of San Pedro may pose a health risk based on a preliminary review. 
In response to a public outcry in Long Beach, the county’s agricultural commissioner, which issues permits to the fumigation companies, required new permit conditions that aim to reduce emissions from the two Long Beach plants.
But permits obtained by CalMatters for three facilities in Compton and San Pedro show that they use much larger volumes of methyl bromide than the Long Beach facilities — yet their permit conditions remain unchanged.
In a letter to regulatory agencies, Democratic U.S. Reps. Nanette Barragán, Maxine Waters and Robert Garcia called for monitors to be installed near all L.A. County fumigation facilities, health assessments for affected communities and the public disclosure of inspection records.
But the South Coast air district does not plan to install air monitors or hold meetings with residents to notify them of potential risks. It is, however, screening facilities to determine whether a full analysis of their health risks is necessary. But even if that analysis is greenlit, the agency said companies would only be required to reduce their emissions if they emit the chemical at concentrations three times higher than the amount deemed a health risk by the state.

Sarah Rees, South Coast’s deputy executive office for planning, rule development and implementation: “We don’t want to go out and unnecessarily concern folks if there isn’t (a health concern), but we are actively investigating this right now.”

Edvin Hernandez, a father whose son attends an elementary school near the Compton facility, told CalMatters there appears to be “no interest from the government to protect our health.”
“We’re surviving by the hand of God,” he said.

First-of-its-kind program struggles to survive

As California struggles to find stable housing for its 187,000 homeless residents, it must also contend with training and employing the people it needs to provide front-line homelessness services, write CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall and Adam Echelman.
Jobs that require face-to-face interaction with unhoused people — such as doing outreach in encampments, working at homeless shelters and being case managers — struggle to recruit and retain staff.
To meet the demands of L.A. County’s homeless population, Santa Monica College began a program last year to train prospective homeless service workers. A state fund provided the program with about $750,000, but once the money runs out, it’s unclear what will happen to the program. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed state budget in January did not include any money for the fund.
Compounding the situation is the fact that the L.A. Homeless Services Authority — the agency that funds the college’s training program — is experiencing its own turmoil. After a scathing audit, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted earlier this month to pull its money out of the agency. The city is also considering doing the same.

CA launches education and workforce database

Though debuting months behind schedule, a new statewide education data system to track student progress officially launched Tuesday, reports CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
Championed by Gov. Newsom, the Cradle to Career Data System gathers data from roughly 3.5 million California public high school graduates and discloses where students enrolled in college; what kinds of degrees they earned; and the wages they earned after receiving a college diploma or certificate. 
Similar tools have been developed by the state in years past, but the new database is more widely accessible to the public and collects data from more schools and state agencies. 
In its current form, the dashboards reveal just a small segment of the state’s education and workforce data. Officials say they will roll out updates to the database, though no specific timelines were given. 
For instance, information about students who attended private or out-of-state colleges will be integrated, as well as students who didn’t graduate high school. The state has also pledged to release other data as part of the Cradle to Career Data System, such as information about early childhood education and teachers’ training and retention.

Ben Ray Luján, New Mexico Democrat, talked about efforts to push back at the Trump administration in a town hall April 22.","U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) addressed approximately 200 people at a town hall at Santa Fe Community College on April 22, 2025 (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Education. Social Security. Health care. Attendees at a town hall hosted by U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) Tuesday night at Santa Fe Community College brought questions and concerns on a variety of topics, but the Trump administration served as the unifying thread.
“We have a lawless administration,” attendee Gary Lasswell said when he was called upon (organizers used a raffle system to take questions from the approximate 200 attendees). “We hear talk about that we haven’t technically gotten ourselves into a constitutional crisis. This administration is already disobeying laws. They’re disobeying judges. They’re gas lighting, they’re stonewalling. They are not obeying judges orders. The resistance that we’re starting to see a spark of, especially in the last month or so all across the country, is a good start, but we also need leaders within our party, within the Democratic Party, to be out there, like Bernie [Sanders] and AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez].”
Said Judy Trimarchi: “We are in the midst of a fascist coup. It’s nothing less than that. We can’t expect to reason for what they’re doing. There is no explanation. There’s no going back and looking at what they used to do or what they used to be like, or how we used to work together, or what we used to stand for, or what we pushed for, that’s moot. It means nothing anymore. We are in a war for our democracy and nothing less.”
Folks in the room also had suggestions for Luján and the Democratic Party in general: Use simpler language to discuss what’s happening. Go on tour with Sanders and talk about universal health care. And requests: Talk to the military and secure commitments to serve the Constitution versus the Commander in Chief; back a special election or an impeachment trial.
Luján took it all in stride. “I agree with the question about the crisis that we’re in today,” he told the room. “I’m not the only senator that has been abundantly clear that I believe that we are in a crisis.”
As for touring nationally: “I appreciate you suggesting that I should hold something like Bernie,” Luján said. “Mine would be very small, but I know that.”
Regarding a special election: A non-starter, he noted. Not possible under the law. Impeachment also not possible given the Republican majorities in Congress.
That being said, Luján did discuss in detail how he and the rest of the state’s delegation and other Democrats are working to push back at the Trump administration and fellow Republicans.
“Here’s the legislative tool,” Luján said, ” it’s forcing my Republican colleagues to hold these votes where they don’t want to take a vote on something. You can’t stop the Republicans because of the sheer spread that they have right now…We need four in any one of these votes. And over the last three weeks — which seems like an eternity —…we’ve got three Republicans who have the courage to push back against this administration, but we’ve not seen a fourth.”
Luján, however, expressed optimism about the impact constituents across the country could have on that equation, particularly when his colleagues encounter them at home. “There’s something magical that happens when people come back [to Congress] after being home for a week or for two weeks with their constituents,” he said. “They go to grocery store, maybe they’ll go to a church service, maybe they’ll go somewhere else and see constituents. They’re talking to them.”
Democrats, he added, “need to keep turning up the volume in all of these committees on the floor as much as we possibly can.” That means, he added, calling out falsehoods. “Like I told my mom: I’m done saying, ‘Oh, well, that’s not completely true,’ or, ‘You may have misstated that. A lie is a lie, and the way that I was raised, a cover up is worse than a lie.”
Luján encouraged everyone in the room to also continue raising their voices. “When these personal stories are being shared about someone that’s been personally negative impacted, and I can engage my colleagues in those spaces, in that debate, that’s one of the most powerful tools that we have right now,” he said.
Following the close to two-hour town hall, Luján told Source he agreed with sentiments from attendees that “everyone needs to do more…if one of my colleagues is holding a gathering where 30,000 people are there, we’re all supporting each other, and everyone needs to do everything that they can and use all the tools and talents that they have to be able to connect with the American people.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BenRayLujanApril22-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-23 09:02:23.987227

Five facilities near schools and houses in LA County fumigate produce shipped from overseas with methyl bromide. But the air agency doesn’t plan to monitor the air or take any immediate steps to protect people from the gas, which can damage lungs and cause neurological effects.




In a quiet Compton neighborhood near the 710 freeway, children on a recent afternoon chased each other at Kelly Park after school. Parents watched their kids play, unaware of a potential threat to their health. 
On the other side of the freeway, just blocks from the park and Kelly Elementary School, a fumigation company uses a highly toxic pesticide to spray fruits and vegetables. 
The facility, Global Pest Management, has been emitting methyl bromide, which can cause lung damage and neurological health effects, into the air near the neighborhood for several decades. 
Earlier this year, the South Coast Air Quality Management District asked the company — along with four other fumigation facilities in San Pedro and Long Beach — to provide data on their methyl bromide usage. But the air quality agency does not plan to install monitors in the communities that would tell residents exactly what is in their air, or hold community meetings to notify them of potential risks.
Instead, the South Coast district has launched a preliminary screening of the five facilities to determine if a full assessment of health risks in the neighborhoods is necessary. But even if that analysis is conducted, the agency won’t require the companies to reduce emissions unless they reach concentrations three times higher than the amounts deemed a health risk under state guidelines, said Scott Epstein, the district’s planning and rules manager.
Piedad Delgado, a mother picking up her daughter from the Compton school, said she “didn’t even know” that the hazardous chemical was being used nearby. When a CalMatters reporter told her about the fumigation plant, Delgado wondered if it was causing her daughter’s recent, mysterious bouts of headaches and nausea.
“It’s concerning. We may be getting sick but we don’t know why,” she said.
For about the past 30 years, the companies have sprayed methyl bromide on imported produce arriving at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to kill harmful pests.

Methyl bromide, which was widely used to treat soil on farm fields, has been banned worldwide for most uses since 2005 under a United Nations treaty that protects the Earth’s ozone layer. Exemptions are granted for fumigation of produce shipped from overseas. While little to no residue remains on the food, the gas is vented into the air where it is sprayed.
State health officials have classified methyl bromide as a reproductive toxicant, which means it can harm babies exposed in the womb. With acute exposure, high levels can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing, while chronic exposure over a year or longer could cause more serious neurological effects, such as learning and memory problems, according to the California Air Resources Board.
“It’s concerning. We may be getting sick but we don’t know why.”Piedad Delgado, Compton Resident
State and local air quality officials are responsible for enforcing laws and regulations that protect communities from toxic air contaminants such as methyl bromide, while the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner issues the permits to the fumigation companies.
After CalMatters reported about the facilities last month, members of Congress representing the communities demanded “greater monitoring, transparency and oversight surrounding these fumigation facilities and their toxic emissions.”
“We have serious concerns about the prevalent use of methyl bromide, a toxic pesticide, by container fumigation facilities in Los Angeles County,” U.S. Reps. Nanette Barragán, Maxine Waters and Robert Garcia wrote in an April 11 letter to state and local air regulators and county and federal agricultural officials. 
“Several of these fumigation facilities are located close to homes, schools, parks, and other public spaces. Our communities deserve a greater understanding of the levels of toxic emissions from these facilities, the health risks from exposure to such emissions, and the oversight processes in place to ensure all protocols are maintained at these sites,” they wrote.
“Our communities deserve a greater understanding of the levels of toxic emissions from these facilities, the health risks from exposure to such emissions, and the oversight processes in place.”U.S. Reps. Nanette Barragán, Maxine Waters and Robert Garcia
Even though the San Pedro facility at the Port of Los Angeles and the Compton plant use the largest volumes of methyl bromide — a combined 52,000 pounds a year — the air in nearby communities has never been tested. 
The two Long Beach facilities use much less, yet state tests in 2023 and 2024 detected potentially dangerous levels in a neighborhood near an elementary school.

South Coast district officials said although certain levels of methyl bromide in the air could cause health effects, it doesn’t necessarily mean immediate action is necessary. 
“We don’t want to go out and unnecessarily concern folks if there isn’t (a health concern), but we are actively investigating this right now,” said Sarah Rees, the South Coast district’s deputy executive office for planning, rule development and implementation.  
Global Pest Management, which fumigates in Compton and Terminal Island, did not return calls from CalMatters. An employee at the facility declined to comment. A general manager at SPF Terminals in Long Beach also declined to comment. 
Greg Augustine, owner of Harbor Fumigation in San Pedro, said his company has been permitted for more than 30 years and complies with all requirements.
“To protect the health of our community, the air district establishes permit conditions and we comply with all of those permit conditions,” he said. “Those are vetted by the air district…and they’re all designed to protect the health of our community.” 
“To protect the health of our community, the air district establishes permit conditions and we comply with all of those permit conditions.” Greg Augustine, owner of Harbor Fumigation in San Pedro
Daniel McCarrel, an attorney representing AG-Fume Services, which fumigates at facilities in Long Beach and San Pedro, did not respond to questions but previously told CalMatters last month that the company is adhering to all of its permit conditions. 
High levels found in Long Beach 
Back in 2019, during regionwide testing, South Coast district officials detected methyl bromide in the air near the two West Long Beach facilities close to concentrations that could cause long-term health effects. The South Coast district took no action at the time — other than to publish a large study online of all toxic air contaminants throughout the four-county LA basin. 
Then, several years later, the state Air Resources Board found that the two facilities — SPF Terminals and AG-Fume Services — spewed high concentrations of methyl bromide at various times throughout the year.
The state’s air monitor near Hudson Elementary School in West Long Beach — which is just about 1,000 feet from the two facilities — detected an average of 2.1 parts per billion in 2023 through part of 2024. Exposure to as little as 1 ppb for a year or more can cause serious nervous system effects as well as developmental effects on fetuses, according to state health guidelines. 
Spikes of methyl bromide were as high as 983 and 966 ppb in February and March of 2024. Short-term exposure to 1,000 ppb can cause acute health effects such as nausea, headaches and dizziness. 
But state and district air-quality officials didn’t inform nearby residents about any of the monitoring data for longer than a year — not until three months ago, in a community meeting held in Long Beach.

Upon learning of the test results, the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner a few months ago added new permit conditions for SPF Terminals and AG-Fume Services, including shutting doors, installing taller smokestacks and prohibiting fumigation during school hours, according to permits obtained by CalMatters.
But the county permits for the three San Pedro and Compton facilities, which use much larger volumes of methyl bromide, remain unchanged, with none of the protections added to the Long Beach permits. And officials still have not held any community meetings there.
The agricultural commissioner’s office declined to comment on the facilities.
A complex web of ‘hot spots’ rules for methyl bromide
About 38% of the methyl bromide used in California for commodity fumigation is in LA County, according to Department of Pesticide Regulation data for 2022.
After many Long Beach residents expressed concerns, the South Coast district assessed all nine facilities permitted to use the chemical in the region and determined that five could pose a risk to residents. 
Now the agency is going through a complex process outlined under the state’s Air Toxics “Hot Spots” law, enacted in 1987.  Usage data, weather patterns and proximity to neighborhoods will be used to calculate a “priority score” for each of the five facilities.
If a facility’s score is high enough, then the company will be required to conduct a full health risk assessment to examine the dangers to the community. None of the scores have been released yet. 
Risk assessments under the air district’s rules are a complicated, multi-step process likely to take many months.

And these health assessments may not trigger any changes at the facilities. It all depends on whether certain thresholds for hazards are crossed.
The state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has set guidelines, called reference exposure levels, for concentrations of methyl bromide that could cause the long-term or short-term health effects, such as respiratory and neurological damage, nausea and fetal effects, based on human and animal studies.
But South Coast district officials said action isn’t triggered if methyl bromide exceeds these reference levels. Instead, the district uses a state-created “hazard index” based on them.
If a facility’s hazard index reaches one — which means concentrations outside the facility have reached the reference dose and could cause harm — the company must notify the public, under a South Coast district regulation. However, the facilities will only be required to take steps to reduce emissions if the hazard index reaches three — three times the reference level that indicates potential harm, according to that regulation. Expedited action is required under the rule if the index is five times higher.  
“Just because it’s above the (reference level), it doesn’t mean it’s going to cause health impacts,” said Ian MacMillan, assistant deputy executive officer at the South Coast air district. He said the reference level indicates “there’s a possibility that there could be health impacts.” 
The series of escalating thresholds is designed as a balancing act between regulating facilities and protecting the public, officials said.
MacMillan also said methyl bromide emissions must be considered in the context of overall air quality in the region — the entire LA basin has an average hazard index of 5.5 when considering all sources of toxic air pollutants from industries and vehicles, he said.
When told about the fumigation plants and lack of air testing and risk assessments, residents contacted by CalMatters were outraged.
“There’s no interest from the government to protect our health,” said Edvin Hernandez, a father picking up his 9-year-old son from Kelly Elementary School in Compton. “We’re surviving by the hand of God.”
The members of Congress — Barragán, Waters and Garcia — asked air regulators to install monitors near all Los Angeles County fumigation facilities, compile inspection records, conduct health assessments in the communities and provide all of the results on a public website. 
“It is egregious that communities in California are still being impacted by this harmful and unnecessary chemical,” said Alison Hahm, a staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is working with community members. “In addition to stopping this ongoing public health threat in West Long Beach and Los Angeles, residents are demanding accountability and remedies for the harm endured.”
The methyl bromide facilities in L.A. County are subjected to a different permitting process than elsewhere in California. 
That’s because in 1996, the South Coast air district and the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner agreed to share responsibility for regulating fumigating facilities. The agricultural office is tasked with issuing permits and the air agency is in charge of setting emissions limits and enforcing them.  
In the Bay Area, the local air district has a similar agreement with agricultural departments that originated in 1997. However, the district decided that agreement is out of date so it is now issuing permits, too. One facility in the Bay Area uses the pesticide, Impact Transportation of Oakland. In 2019, the air district assessed the health risks of that facility and modeled how the fumes spread.  
In the San Joaquin Valley, new facilities or those changing their methyl bromide use are subject to a health risk evaluation before a permit is issued. Facilities permitted before the air district was established in 1992 are subject to a review like the one that the South Coast district is now launching in San Pedro and Compton.
The Los Angeles Agriculture Commissioner’s office, when asked whether it conducts a risk assessment before issuing permits, declined to answer any questions. CalMatters filed a public records request seeking risk assessments, but they said they had no records matching the request.  
South Coast air regulators said they and the commissioner are now considering if any changes to their agreement should be made. 
Allowed to use up to a half-ton of methyl bromide a day 
Fumigation of produce using methyl bromide occurs within an enclosed facility, and the produce is covered by a tarp when sprayed. The fumes are then released into the atmosphere through tall smokestacks, a process called aeration.
CalMatters filed a public records request with the county agricultural office and received the five facilities’ permits for 2023 through 2025. The permits show that the two Long Beach companies are now required to take an array of new precautions to limit fumes emitted into communities that the three Compton and San Pedro families are not — even though the Long Beach ones use much smaller volumes of methyl bromide.
The San Pedro and Compton plants are allowed to use up to 1,000 pounds of methyl bromide in a 24-hour period. In contrast, the Long Beach plants can use up to 200 pounds in 24 hours, and in Oakland, Impact Transportation’s permit allows only 108 pounds.

The San Pedro and Compton facilities release fumes into the atmosphere during the daytime, except when they use an exhaust stack meeting certain height requirements, according to their permits.
The two Long Beach facilities, SPF Terminals and AG Fume Services, have new, additional requirements this year: Fumigation can’t occur between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. when a school is within 1,000 feet. And by the end of this month, they must replace their smokestacks with taller ones that are at least 55 feet tall, which disperse the fumes better. All doors must be closed during fumigation and aeration and fans must be used in the aeration process. 
‘We don’t have a choice’
At a ballpark on a recent day in San Pedro, Eastview Little League players took the field.  When a 13-year-old boy on the Pirates team was up to bat, his mom, Amy Shannon, cheered him on. 
“Let’s go D! Deep breath boy, you got it!” she shouted. 
Then she paused. Maybe she shouldn’t be encouraging her son to take a deep breath, she said. Shannon had just learned from CalMatters about the fumigation facility across the street from the baseball field.

At the facility where AG Fume and Harbor Fumigation operate, located at 2200 Miner Street, it was business as usual that day. A ship was docked on one side of the Los Angeles Port berth. On the other side, hundreds of stacks of fruits and vegetables were visible through several large garage doors. 
Some of the stacks were covered with plastic. A tank containing a fumigant — labeled with a hazard sign depicting a skull — was hooked up outside. Yellow smokestacks protruded from the facility. 
An AG-Fume Services truck was parked near one of the garage doors. Workers wearing yellow vests and sun-protective hats closed the garage doors, but left them slightly open at the bottom. 
At the baseball field, Shannon watched the game with a friend, Roxanne Gasparo. Both women grew up in San Pedro. Gasparo said she wasn’t at all surprised to learn that a dangerous gas could be in their air.  
“Because it’s a port town, unfortunately, we’re used to pollution. We have the port, obviously, and all the refineries next to us,” Gasparo said.
“There’s really no way to get out of it unless you leave the city, and because most of the families here are blue collar families that rely on the unions, we kind of don’t have a choice,” she added. “We just deal with it and raise our kids the best we can.”

Addiction and homelessness are a constant presence in L.A.’s mental health court. Its judge wants defendants to “feel like someone who’s deep in the system of power cares about them.


In a Hollywood courtroom, prosecutor and defense attorney both asserted their positions on how to best administer justice to the man appearing before them in shackled restraints. Judge Ronald Owen Kaye surveyed documents on his computer, then looked over his eyeglasses from person to person.
“We’ve got quite a lot going on here,” Kaye said that day in February. He then turned his focus squarely to the defendant. With a state-appointed psychiatrist’s evaluation now on file, the judge wanted to discuss next steps. “I’d like to hear where you stand on all this, sir. Let’s talk turkey.”
“I’m sorry, your Honor,” responded the man in earnest. “I wasn’t planning on having turkey for lunch. I was kinda hoping for tuna.”
With a gentle smile, Kaye removed his glasses and patiently explained to the troubled defendant how the turn-of-phrase simply meant it was time to get to business. In Kaye’s Los Angeles Superior Court, that business often entails balancing criminal justice with appropriate mental health care needs to address both public safety and individual accountability.
When a criminal defendant’s mental competency to stand trial is at issue, their case will get redirected to a handful of courtrooms like Kaye’s. In partnership with L.A. County’s Office of Diversion and Reentry, these mental health courts can also further assess the alleged offenders for treatment and housing placement.
Defendants appear before Judge Kaye via different means. Many are transported from L.A. County Jail, shackled and ushered into the courtroom by sheriff’s deputies. They often stand disheveled, maybe aloof or hypervigilant, lucid or confused, bouncy or somber.

Others appear remotely from two video monitors live streamed from county and state facilities. Some even enter the building through the front door on their own volition.
In March, one defendant nodded and stared unblinking through the video screens as his public defender told the court his client was ready to accept treatment and be transferred from county jail to a state hospital.
“Is that what you want, sir?” said Kaye. “We want to get you out of that locked box as soon as possible and get you where you can get help, but I need to hear it from you.”
“I want to go home,” the man said, his body tense as he leaned closer to the camera in distress. “I want to go home.”
Both Kaye and the public defender explained to him that being released was not an option. Either the court would find him incompetent and place him in hospitalized custody — or if he was found competent, he would stand trial in a criminal court and face his felony charges. 
“I want to go to trial so I can go home,” the man continued.
“Sir, in this court you absolutely have the right to a trial to determine mental competency,” Judge Kaye assured him. “But your attorney and the prosecutor have agreed in the best interests of justice to get you treatment at the state hospital. You don’t want that?”
The man’s wild-eyed expression told the story of his incompetence. “Yes, I want to go home.”
Judge Kaye postponed a ruling for 30 days. “Talk to your client,” he said to the defender. “But if he says he wants a trial here, we’ll have to honor that.”
On a Friday in February, a woman appeared on the monitors from a treatment facility, with a clinician beside her raving about her steady improvement over the last six months. She smiled and waved as Kaye listened to her positive evaluation report.
“We are all so happy to see you doing so well,” Kaye said. “Just continue on this path and you’ll be back with your family, okay?”
“Yes, judge,” she said. “Thank you for changing my life.” Like many people receiving services through the Office of Diversion and Reentry, she found stable mental health care through the court’s ability to offer and monitor residential housing and treatment.
“No, no,” he said. “You’re the one working to get yourself better. Keep it up.”
Kaye’s path to mental health court
A former legal aid attorney, federal public defender and civil rights attorney who’d filed multiple lawsuits against the county for deprivation of mental health care, Kaye suddenly found himself assigned to the mental health court soon after Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him to the bench in 2020.
“I really didn’t know what to expect, but I did know from my prior civil rights practice a bit about the lack of mental health care in Los Angeles County,” said Kaye. “So I felt how fortuitous that somebody like me would have the authority to assure that, as much as possible, quality care is provided.”
“I’m always balancing these issues of liberty — people’s freedom; and treatment — getting them quality of care; and making sure the community is safe. That’s essentially what I do in virtually every aspect of my job.”

Kaye said that the last handful of years on the bench have opened his eyes to the ravaging toll methamphetamine abuse extracts on a person’s long-term mental health. “I also never knew firsthand the level of methamphetamine abuse that is just plaguing the homeless and the mentally ill community, and how profoundly difficult methamphetamine is as a drug to kick,” he said. 
He has also been struck by the effectiveness of psychotropic medications. “I had no idea of how they can interrupt delusional thinking and give a person a level of stability,” he said. “With the right care and the right psychotropic medications, I’ve seen miracles happen.”
Where the circumstances merit intervention and housing, Kaye tries to look at a person’s full history and make a positive impact on their lives. But it’s complicated, particularly when he encounters people who’ve been in and out of the criminal justice and mental health systems for years or even decades. 
“I deal with chronic homelessness, chronic mental illness, and drug abuse,” he said. “The drug abuse is often a manifestation of the mental illness because they’re engaged in self-medication — and that all manifests in criminal conduct.”
Launched in 2015, L.A.’s Diversion and Reentry services have helped more than 13,000 incarcerated persons with diagnosed mental health disorders transition successfully out of county jail. The program currently handles over 2,500 participants in residential housing treatment, with roughly 1,400 in permanent supportive housing.
California’s Department of State Hospitals began a pilot program in 2018 that helped implement diversion services in 28 additional counties to address the growing numbers of criminal defendants deemed incompetent to stand trial, many of whom also deal with homelessness and/or substance abuse.
Effective June 30, the pilot program will end — to be replaced by permanent diversion services available to all counties that choose to implement them. According to the Department of State Hospitals, 10 permanent county programs have already been contracted, and 14 others are currently in the process of having their contracts finalized.

On another day in Kaye’s court, a middle-aged man appeared in person for a scheduled progress check and stood at the small podium on the public side of the courtroom. He and Kaye spoke about his progress in outpatient treatment.
“Are you still living in that RV on the street?” Kaye asked him. “Are you working?”
“I’m just barely getting by, your Honor,” he said. “It’s a struggle.”
“We can get you in a housing program right now,” the judge said. “Hot meals, a safe bed, a stable health care environment. But I can’t force that on you. It’s your decision.”
The man declined Kaye’s offer, citing how he lives in his vehicle with his girlfriend and their dog — and they all need to stay together. He walked out of the court with a follow-up appearance scheduled in 60 days.
“My vision, if at all possible, is to make people feel comfortable in court and make them feel like they matter,” he said. “They can actually be looked at in the eye by someone in authority and feel like someone who’s deep in the system of power cares about them.”
New courtroom experiences for former prisoners
The human potential for growth — and to be able to earn a second chance — is a recurring theme of Kaye’s career. Away from the  bench, he also works with the formerly incarcerated community to provide emotional support and inspiration.
In collaboration with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and the Los Angeles Innocence Project, Kaye meets with newly paroled people, welcoming them into his courtroom and chambers, where he is free of his robe and the usual symbols of authority. 
Franky Carrillo, chief policy director for the Innocence Project in L.A., knows Kaye well. After being exonerated in 2011 for a wrongful murder conviction, Carrillo first partnered with Kaye to bring a civil lawsuit against L.A. County, a case that resulted in a $10 million settlement approved by the Board of Supervisors in 2016.
Through his nonprofit, Restorative Project, Carrillo has brought Kaye on retreats with mixed groups of formerly incarcerated ex-lifers, criminal justice reform advocates and allies to speak and help build a stronger sense of community.
“I think it’s very healing to have Judge Kaye be present, in order to maybe take away the stigma of what a judge might’ve signified in someone’s life — 20, 30 years prior, when they were sentenced,” said Carrillo. “Lo’ and behold, you’re free, and this is your first interaction with a judge on the outside.”
Mery Alaberkyan served as Judge Kaye’s judicial assistant from 2023 to 2024, while starting Loyola Law School. Her time in his court shaped her vision of the kind of lawyer she hopes to become. 
The most important lesson Alaberkyan took away from Kaye’s courtroom demeanor was his humanizing style of communication.
“He would greet every single defendant, making sure they were acknowledged and that they understood what was happening in the courtroom,” she said. “You see people in a jumpsuit and most people’s reaction is to shy away, but he actually made sure that defendants were treated like this is their case and not something that was happening to them — like, whatever you need to say, you may say.”

On April 5, the Criminal Courts Bar Association of Los Angeles honored Judge Kaye with its  annual Morton Herbert Award for outstanding community service. Typically, the award goes to attorneys for volunteer work. Only once before has it gone to a judge since it was created in the 1950s. 
“This category fit him perfectly,” said Christopher Chaney, the association’s executive director, who represented several clients in Kaye’s court during the COVID-era mental health crisis. 
“We all know about his empathetic approach and the work he does going into prisons and helping individuals with their life after prison,” Chaney said. “Our recidivism rates – the numbers are so upside down. We gotta figure out soft landings for these guys when they get out.” 
The night of the award ceremony, Carrillo and other formerly incarcerated  individuals joined the black-tie gala to celebrate their friend and ally. In a tuxedo, standing beside his wife at a VIP table, Judge Kaye hugged many of them and made sure they were included in photos. 
“You know, mental court anywhere — but especially here in Los Angeles — is not easy,” Carrillo said. “Because he came pre-equipped with the compassion that I think all judges should have, it’s just perfect. It’s a win-win for the county and for everyone in the courtroom.”

California Senate Housing Committee Chair Aisha Wahab is a staunch progressive who is clashing with pro-development activists and other Democrats who want to build more, faster.


Amid a post-2024 wave of Democratic interest in the burgeoning pro-development “abundance” movement, this seemed to be an easy year for California’s yes-in-my-backyard housing development activists. 
Democratic leaders in the state Legislature declared their intention to tackle affordability this year. Gov. Gavin Newsom and other politicians have since embraced the “abundance” platform, which argues that Democrats must do more to quickly deliver housing, transportation and other infrastructure projects to their constituents. 
Lawmakers have introduced ambitious bills that would, for housing developments in existing neighborhoods, blow a hole through the longstanding thicket of environmental reviews and regulations that often slow down projects and add costs. One of those passed its first committee on Monday.
Still, YIMBY-ism hit a stumbling block Tuesday in the form of the Senate housing committee. The committee, led by Sen. Aisha Wahab, nearly killed a closely watched bill to require cities to allow taller, denser apartments and condo construction near public transit stations. 
Wahab said she was acting on a chorus of familiar objections from progressives and others who have long delayed housing construction in California: The legislation didn’t guarantee that projects would be built with union labor. It didn’t require that the new units be affordable for low-income residents. It could infringe on local governments’ ability to block or green-light projects. It opened up the possibility of bypassing certain environmental reviews. 
In the end, the committee voted 6-2 against Wahab’s objections to narrowly advance Senate Bill 79, by Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and prominent advocate for housing production. Some Democrats were absent or didn’t vote. The committee also killed a different Wiener bill that would have further loosened restrictions on property owners who want to split single-family homes into duplexes. It was a stark reversal from prior years in the Legislature, when Wiener chaired the housing committee and pushed through several bills to spur housing production.
The tense hearing on Tuesday exposed pro-development advocates’ mounting frustrations with Wahab. It also revealed remaining hurdles for “abundance”-minded Democrats in a progressive Legislature where lawmakers who say they want to increase housing construction are nevertheless prone to tacking on price controls, labor agreements and other regulations to appease various constituencies. 
That lawmakers voted to advance the bill despite Wahab’s opposition indicates some are ready to override progressive concerns on housing developments. But critics predict debates like these will ultimately sink Democratic leaders’ goals of refocusing the party platform on making California affordable. 
“They’re going to blow it,” said Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a San Diego Republican, of the Democrats’ affordability agenda earlier this month. “They still believe in government control. They’ll release this regulation, but not this other one. They’re not willing to deregulate enough.”
Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, who appointed Wahab as committee chair, did not respond to inquiries about how Wahab’s stances and the debate over what limits to place on development affects his affordability agenda. He instead issued a statement saying that finding “innovative solutions” to the housing crisis “is at the top of the Senate’s agenda.”
“While it’s still early in the legislative session and in the committee hearing process, there are dozens of housing bills that legislators are having meaningful and honest conversation and debate on,” he said. “I trust we’ll have significant housing legislation advance this year.”
Wiener would not say whether he has asked McGuire to step in, but said he was confident a growing number of lawmakers agree with his approach to make it easier to build.
YIMBYs fight more cautious approach
Pro-development activists have clashed with Wahab since last month, when, during her first hearing as chair of the housing committee, she questioned the effectiveness of policies that have loosened restrictions on the dense, urban, sometimes parking-less projects that are central to the YIMBY platform of bringing down rents by increasing the supply of market-rate housing.

A progressive who is focused on preserving explicitly affordable units for low-income tenants, Wahab, a Hayward Democrat, was pushing for legislation to help cities that enact rent caps compete with other municipalities for state housing and planning grants. Some studies have found rent control in San Francisco has reduced rental supply, while other economists say capping rents is still needed to help those who are housing insecure.
“The state has prioritized development, development, development,” Wahab said. “The types of development that are going up with zero parking and all these giveaways to developers have also not translated to housing that has dignity that people want to stay in and raise their families in.”
Her bill drew skepticism from some colleagues on the committee, who noted the state funding programs are for development and production, but nevertheless voted to advance it. 
The chair continued to frustrate pro-development activists with her opposition to Wiener’s housing-near-transit bill. 
It is a narrower revival of a proposal Wiener tried before. In 2018, he introduced legislation to allow taller, denser buildings around major transit stops, overriding local zoning rules and the objections of local governments. It died in committee. In 2020, he took another crack at the issue. That bill was silently axed by the Senate’s appropriations chair.
In unusually frank comments as he presented the bill on Tuesday, Wiener said Wahab had not offered any amendments to the legislation — only blanket opposition — and criticized the analysis prepared by the committee’s staff, who work under Wahab’s leadership. 
“Reading the committee analysis is just an avalanche, laundry-list of 10,000 things that are supposedly wrong with the bill,” he said. “Reading the analysis, there’s apparently not a single thing in the bill you like.”
Wahab, in turn, said the lack of explicit affordability requirements for units built near transit made the proposal a “non-starter for me at the very beginning.”
“I do believe in building more,” she said. “We must build housing for all income levels, and I have been consistent in that position.”
Chairs tend to get their way in the Capitol, but on rare occasions a committee votes to override their concerns, a tactic Wiener has used before. 
In 2023, he was pushing what was then among the most controversial pro-housing development bills through the Legislature. When Arleta Democrat Luz Rivas, then the chairperson of the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, attempted to kill it, a bipartisan gaggle of Republicans and pro-development Democrats pushed it through anyway.

Now, some 114 years later, Californians have reached their limit with the cozy cronyism between the commission and the private utilities it is required to keep in check. 
That voter initiative in the early 20th century made the commission the primary protector of California’s families and businesses against rapacious or unsafe electric and gas utilities. California statutes are filled with requirements that the utilities commission ensures that each cost to provide electricity and gas to customers is both necessary, as well “just and reasonably” priced. 
As President Franklin D. Roosevelt put it during a 1932 campaign stop in Oregon, state utility commissions have a “delegated authority and duty to act as the agent of the public themselves; that it is not a mere arbitrator as between the people and the public utilities, but was created for the purpose of seeing that the public utilities do two things: first, give adequate service; second, charge reasonable rates.”
“This means,” he continued, “when that duty is properly exercised, positive and active protection of the people against private greed!”
Today, Californians are again faced with what FDR called “a systematic, subtle, deliberate and unprincipled campaign of misinformation, of propaganda, … lies and falsehoods” — bought and paid for by private utilities, he remarked. 
More than a century later, California’s utilities commission has lost its way. Over the past 10 years, each and every time California’s private utility companies have wanted more of our money, the state’s appointed commissioners have willingly agreed. 
Between 2019 and 2023, average residential electricity rates increased 47%, outpacing inflation, the Legislative Analyst’s Office noted in a January report. Last year alone, the commission approved six increases for PG&E, while it raked in record-breaking profits.
California’s utilities commission is neglecting its primary responsibility. The companies claim that they know best what money and programs they need in order to provide gas and electric service to their customers. They ask us to trust them to spend customer money wisely, without suffocating their businesses with regulatory bureaucrats standing over their shoulders, second-guessing every dollar spent. The CPUC has increasingly obliged, allowing the utilities to choose for themselves what they will spend money on or decide how much they will charge for electric and gas service — gold-plating profit potential without sticking to job one: safe and reliable service at a reasonable cost. 
Over and over again, the utilities ask and the commission gives them whatever they want. In the past three years the CPUC has created a pernicious practice of “interim” rate increases, handing the utilities billions of dollars more without even having to list or provide any detail for the specific costs they presented for payment.

These interim rate decisions abrogate the CPUC’s fundamental role to dig into the utilities’ cost proposals, figure out what we actually should pay for safe service, and reject the expensive baubles and trinkets Californians shouldn’t be on the hook for.  
The commission also ignored independent audits of the utilities’ wildfire spending. In 2021, California’s big three utilities either could not account for or diverted $240 million, $700 million and $1.5 billion in money the CPUC had already allowed the companies to collect for programs they proposed, planned and profited off. The audits urged commissioners to withhold money for additional wildfire prevention projects until the utilities could explain what they spent the initial funding on.
Read More: Californians pay billions for power companies’ wildfire prevention efforts. Are they cost-effective?
That didn’t happen. Both PG&E and Southern California Edison were given the vast majority of what they asked for in new funding, without any true up or requirement that they explain how they spent the previous tranche of public dollars.
So it’s not surprising that California families now face the second-highest utility rates in the nation, and California businesses own the dubious prize of paying the highest business rates in the country.
What’s surprising is why, for so long, we have tolerated the commission’s abdication of its central duty: To protect us while making sure that needed and reasonable investments are made to keep the lights on. When will we require our elected officials to stop the gravy train and make the state utilities commission do its job?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/092022-Power-Lines-RL-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-23 09:02:23.987227

Existing law makes it illegal to threaten people in many cases, but what happens when the threat is against a building, such as a school or a place of worship?


An Inland Empire legislator wants to make it easier to penalize people who make threats affecting schools or places of worship.
The proposal by state Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina, has stirred up broad opposition as well as support from dozens of organizations. It pits police, prosecutors and school employee groups against youth and disability advocates and the ACLU.
Existing law already says it is a crime to make a threat about something that could result in death or great bodily injury to someone. If the threat is “unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific” and causes “sustained fear” in a person, the crime is a misdemeanor or a felony.
Rubio, a former public school teacher at Baldwin Park and Monrovia school districts, said she championed this bill to highlight the location of the threat, rather than the victim of the threat. She said that phoned-in or texted threats often waste time and money for schools and first responders and traumatize people.
“I’ve seen the toll these threats take on students and communities,” she said in a statement. “Even when the danger isn’t real, the fear is, and the trauma stays with kids long after the lockdown ends.”
But there’s disagreement about whether a new law is needed. Opponents point out that this bill is similar to existing law.
Rubio said existing law has too many loopholes, but this bill would give authorities more options.
“California law shouldn’t allow someone to threaten a mass shooting at a school and walk away without consequences, simply because no individual person was named in the threat,” she said.
Groups representing children pointed out that young people often make threats they don’t mean and don’t consider the legal consequences. A new law, they fear, will make schools even more of a conduit to incarceration for some students.
“It allows police intervention for what’s perceived as a threat, even if it’s just a joke, a mental breakdown, or expressing yourself through art,” said Kevin Maturano, a policy fellow with Fresh Lines for Youth. 
“And like every punitive policy, it will target Black and Brown students the most. But beyond the harm for youth, this bill will also waste millions of taxpayer dollars.”
Rubio said her proposed bill specifies that perpetrators who are under 18 would be charged with misdemeanors, not felonies, “to strike a balance between accountability and keeping young people on a path toward growth, not incarceration.”
The bill passed the Public Safety Committee 6-0 in March. On April 7 it was placed on the Appropriations Committee’s suspense file, where most bills that cost extra money go. Legislators are expected to consider it next month.
This is at least the eighth time such a measure has come before the Assembly since 2015. Two similar bills passed in 2015 but were vetoed, and others failed in committee, including during last year’s legislative session. 
This time 32 entities registered support for it, including associations representing police officers, sheriff’s deputies, school resource officers and prosecutors, as well as the League of California Cities, the Hindu America Foundation, Rio Hindo College and San Diegans for Gun Violence Prevention. 
Against it were 16 organizations, including ACLU California Action, the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color, the California Public Defenders Association, the Children’s Defense Fund California, and Disability Rights California.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/051624-Suspense-File-FG-CM-28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-23 09:02:23.987227

But some hope for opportunity.","In summary
From higher costs to export worries, California’s agricultural and wine industries face many possible tariff effects. But some hope for opportunity.



President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs are putting many California businesses, jobs and the state budget at risk. They’re affecting not only long-term relationships with trading partners, but an intricate web of ecosystems and supply chains. 
The California business owners and groups grappling with the tariffs — wine shop owners, winery founders, farmers — say the precise effects on their industries are unclear so far. They hope there will be an upside. 
But for those who have a broad view of trade, things look grim. 
The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, the busiest ports in North America, both saw first-quarter increases in imports, but declines in exports, year over year. 
Gene Seroka, executive director for the Port of Los Angeles, attributed the higher volume of cargo being moved to “front-loading as a hedge against tariffs” during a recent media briefing. But he said his port saw year-over-year declines in exports for the fourth month in a row, “raising concerns for our (agriculture) and manufacturing partners as counter-tariffs on exports begin to take effect.” 
Seroka — who said companies have been telling him they are holding back on hiring and capital investments — predicted a slowdown in cargo movement beginning in May, and expects a 10% drop in volume from July until next year.  His predictions are already beginning to show up in the port’s import volume. 



Some of that may be due to a decline in Chinese imports. On April 9, Trump raised his tariff on China to 145%, although he later exempted certain electronics, such as laptops and smartphones. China responded on April 12 with 125% tariffs on U.S. products. Chinese goods represent 40% of the imports that pass through the Port of Los Angeles, Seroka said.
A decline in volume will affect port jobs, though he doesn’t anticipate mass layoffs, he said. More than 1.5 million jobs are tied to the two Southern California ports. 
The effects of decreased trade will vary for different businesses in the state — even within the same industries.
The California wine industry
A wine merchant in Walnut Creek who sells mostly European wines — on which the president has threatened 200% tariffs — said he’s going to have to make adjustments, like carrying more California wines, or consider closing up shop.
“I’d have to think about whether it’s worthwhile staying in business,” said Igor Ivanov, owner of wine shop Vinous Reverie. He added that the tariff issues are just the latest of the wine industry’s woes, which include the fact that people just aren’t drinking as much alcohol as they used to.
On the other hand, increased tariffs on European wine could help boost California wine.
Natalie Collins, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, said tariffs on competing wines could help local wine growers. 
Bruce Lundquist, co-founder of Rack & Riddle, which he said is the largest custom producer of sparkling wine in the nation, agreed with Collins: “I wish Americans would look at wines grown in their backyard.”
Lundquist said so far Healdsburg-based Rack & Riddle is OK — the company is stocked up on supplies that he orders from different places, both in and out of the country. But he can’t say what his winery and retail clients might be going through. Lundquist worries about tariff uncertainty dragging on, say through next year. “There would have to be a reckoning if this thing were to go on,” he said. “It’s already hard enough to run a winery.”
What’s at stake as the U.S. wine industry grapples with tariffs: $86 billion in annual sales, U.S. Census Bureau data said. California exported $1.3 billion worth of wine in 2022, per the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

Even if the wine produced in this country stays here, tariffs mean winemakers face higher costs on everything from bottles — glass mostly imported from China — to labels and corks, to metal posts and wooden stakes for the vines. As for U.S. wine exports, 95% of those come from California, says Gino DiCaro, spokesperson for the Wine Institute. 
And 35% of exports go to Canada, which now has a serious don’t-buy-American, don’t-go-to-America campaign in effect because of the president’s threats about tariffs and annexing Canada.
“(Canadians) are voting with their feet, and there’s a real sense of betrayal and a sense of shock,” said Rana Sarkar, consul general of Canada in San Francisco. “Economic crisis within Canada will no doubt ensue from this, but it will also be deeply painful in the United States.”
California recently became the first state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the tariffs’ trade and geopolitical effects are “outsized,” while Attorney General Rob Bonta said the president bypassed the power of Congress to tax and regulate commerce by declaring a national emergency. California’s lawsuit seeks to pause the tariffs immediately.
But in some cases, the damage is already done. The office of U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat whose district includes Napa’s Wine Country, shared anonymized anecdotes from winery owners and managers, who the congressman’s staff said are afraid to go on the record. Thompson’s constituents say their Canadian business partners have canceled hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of orders, and that potential sales to Mexico or the European Union are on hold. One medium-size winery in St. Helena told Thompson’s staff that since the tariffs Trump imposed during his first term, it has lost 90% of its business with China and is no longer seeking to sell there: “China has turned to other wine regions across the globe and we believe rebuilding this market will take over 20 years.”
In addition, “the uncertainty itself has had damage, even though we (may not) get the tariffs,” said Daniel Sumner, economics professor and director of the University of California Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis. 
California and other producers of agricultural products want to be able to tell customers they’re reliable suppliers, Sumner said. “But you can’t do that if prices can go up. That’s a real problem,” he said.
Sumner added: “A major concern for any industry is the increased likelihood of a global recession and slower growth in general.” Investment banks and economists have said a recession is likely. Citing Trump’s tariffs, the International Monetary Fund has slashed its forecast for U.S. and global economic growth this year.
Farming: Almonds, dairy and other crops
Ryan Talley is vice president of Talley Farms in Arroyo Grande, in San Luis Obispo County, which was started in the 1940s by his grandfather. Now his children are the fourth generation of his family to work for the farm, which grows a few dozen crops.

Talley said his medium-size farm is still able to sell spinach to Canada, but he’s concerned about being able to sell bell peppers to the country, because harvest season for those won’t come until August through November. He hopes the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will protect those sales — but Trump has threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico a few times.
Talley Farms’ other crops — including  cabbage, kale, lettuce and corn — are distributed domestically but are highly perishable. Talley said that means it’s tough to adjust operations to any tariffs because of changes to fuel, fertilizing or other supply costs. 
“We don’t have months to wait something out,” he said. “We have to continue our operations at the intensity that we currently farm.” He added that “we’re going to have to take those rising prices and deal with it the best we can.” 
In addition, Talley worries that one possible effect of tariffs is a glut of domestically grown crops. “If the majority of U.S. farms weren’t able to export their product, everything would stay here, which would completely flood the market and send prices down,” he said. “It would be great for consumers (in terms of prices) but in the end it would hurt the American farmer.”
But Talley’s biggest concern is his farm’s workers, who could be affected by Trump’s stated intent of mass deportations: “I can withstand an increase in fuel prices and fertilizer prices and regulatory burden to an extent. But if you take away my labor overnight, it would be hard for us.”
It’s almost impossible to find a part of California agriculture unaffected by Trump’s tariffs. 
Shawna Morris, executive vice president of trade policy at the National Milk Producers Federation, said she is concerned about California’s dairy exports to Mexico, including cheese. The other really big market for California dairy products is China, which has already “pulled the trigger” on retaliatory tariffs, Morris said. California’s dairy exports totaled $3.2 billion in 2022. 
California’s biggest export, almonds, had $4.7 billion in foreign sales in 2022. Their longer shelf life is a plus, said almond farmer Jenny Holtermann, in Kern County. “We harvest once a year, then (our processor partners) sell throughout the year,” she said. “The tariffs won’t affect us instantly.”

Holtermann has experience from the tariffs the president imposed during his first term. She would not share specific numbers for her own farm — which has also been in her family for four generations — but acknowledged those tariffs hurt the almond industry, which is “just now starting to rebound.” 
Almond growers saw their prices drop from $2.50 a pound to $1.40 a pound after Trump’s tariffs in 2018, according to research from the University of California Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics.
Holtermann said farmers’ costs have only gone up, so her farm has adjusted by using less fertilizer, buying fewer tractors or letting trucks run a little longer before replacing them. 
But she said she thinks the president’s tariffs are part of “a long-game approach… to get our country back to the economic powerhouse we’re supposed to be.” 
Besides, Holtermann is counting on a couple of things. One is California almonds’ dominance: The state produces 80% of the world’s almonds, says the Almond Alliance. 
The other thing she’s hoping for is another possible federal bailout, which reportedly has been discussed by the Trump administration. During the Trump 1.0 trade war, the federal government provided farmers with “market facilitation funds” of $23 billion to try to offset the business they lost as a result of China’s retaliatory tariffs on the United States, the Government Accountability Office said in a 2021 report.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has not responded to CalMatters’ questions.
Those funds helped her farm last time, Holtermann said, so she’s hoping for more of the same. “I do know he supports agriculture,” she said of the president. “He’s had a lot of meetings with agriculture organizations.” 
Still, she expects to take a short-term hit from tariffs this time around, including losing business from certain countries. “I’m not naive,” Holtermann said. “I’m sure we will miss a portion of that market share.”
But Shannon Douglass, president of the California Farm Bureau, is concerned about getting global buyers to return once they switch to other sources. “We know the last round, almonds and pistachios saw a 20% drop in exports,” she said. “Once they have moved it can take a long time to get those markets back.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/041425-TALLEY-FARMS-JL-30.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-23 09:02:23.987227

It was also the deadline by which non-exempt bills needed to pass the full Senate or full Assembly or be declared dead.
For the small but mighty staff of the Nevada Current, it was a relatively quiet day. None of the dozens of bills we are watching met their demise. That’s not wholly unsurprising. About half the bills we’ve written about have been exempted by the Legislature from standard deadlines because they come with fiscal notes and have been sent to the Legislature’s money committees for consideration.
Speaking of: The next major big day in Carson City is Thursday, May 1. That’s when the Economic Forum will meet and potentially adjust the state’s revenue forecast up or down. As we’ve noted throughout this session, there is reason to be concerned that the outlook won’t be rosy.
But as of right now, there’s still hope. Here’s a status check on all the bills we’ve written about (so far). We’ve included links to the bills themselves, as well as our prior coverage, so you can learn more about them.

(Getty Images)Six Utah municipalities got at least 10% of their overall revenue from traffic fines in 2024, according to the annual report by the Utah State Auditor, though none came close to the state limit on such fines.

Sunset, a city of only about 5,000 people in Davis County, generated the highest percentage, with $502,013 of its $3,359,325 general fund revenue in 2024 stemming from traffic fines. That’s about 15% of its annual general revenue.
According to the auditor’s office, here are the 10 Utah cities and counties that generate the highest percentage of revenue from traffic fines: 

Sunset (pop. 5,400): $502,013 out of $3,359,325, or 14.9%
Mantua (pop. 1,300): $206,820 out of $1,596,394, or 13%
Wellsville (pop. 4,100): $335,888 out of $2,779,116, or 12.1%
Orderville (pop. 570): $48,240 out of $464,330, or 10.4%
Willard (pop. 2,200): $230,269 out of $2,282,692, or 10.1%
Monticello (pop. 1,700): $278,995 out of $2,779,751, or 10%
Vernal (pop. 10,500): $651,998 out of $6,746,045, or 9.7%
Uintah (pop. 1,400): $39,358 out of $738,155, or 5.5%
Box Elder County (64,100): $783,374 out of $14,346,450, or 4.9%
Holladay (pop. 30,200): $2,142,732 out of $23,179,672, or 3.2% 

The state legislature caps the amount of revenue cities can collect from such fines in a year.  Anything above 25% of annual revenue must be handed over to the Utah Department of Transportation, which would then redistribute it around the state to improve class B and C roads, which are locally maintained. No other punitive action would be taken against the city, or county.

The 25% threshold was set by the Utah Legislature in 2021 through a bill sponsored by Sen. Lincoln Fillmore, R-South Jordan. SB75 was intended to “make sure police officers don’t turn into revenue agents,” said Fillmore at the time, referring to a widely publicized instance in Mantua, where the city leaders used traffic tickets to bring more money to the city. According to reporting from FOX13 in 2021, the Mantua Police chief believes he was fired over his opposition to the city’s policy. 
Fillmore’s bill is similar to attempts by the Legislature to rein in money and resources taken by law enforcement, so seizures of property used in crimes didn’t become a revenue stream for specific municipalities. 
“It’s to make sure that municipalities are focused on the distribution of justice and making sure people are doing what they’re supposed to, and not providing any kind of incentive for a municipality to use it as a revenue source to fund other things in the city,” said Seth Oveson, Local Government Manager for the Office of the Utah State Auditor. 
SB75 tasked the auditor’s office with reviewing whether municipalities are compliant.
“Our local government division is diligent in its review of all levels of local governments — towns, cities, counties, school and special districts — to ensure statutory compliance.  This report ensures all municipalities are complying, and provides them and the legislature with accurate information as they plan and set policies,” said Auditor Tina Cannon in a statement last week. 
The general fund is generated from various operations or taxes in a city and town, like property taxes, sales tax, business license fees and court fees.
If a Utah Highway Patrol trooper writes a ticket that results in a fine in a city, the money still goes towards the city. If the fine is collected in a municipality that doesn’t have a justice court, the money goes to the county instead, which is also required to stay under the 25% cap.

SB 112, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, increases the current budget by $543.3 million (5.81%), but a substitute from the Alabama House Ways and Means Education Committee added an additional $17.6 million. That brings the total growth of the ETF to 6%.
“That’s the maximum we were allowed to increase the budget because of our secondary cap. Next year, that number will be 5.75% under this current budget,” Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, the chair of the committee, said Tuesday.

The Senate approved the nearly $10 billion budget on April 10.
Garrett said one of his priorities in the budget is continuing to invest in public education in the state. SB 305, also sponsored by Orr, allows the Legislature to appropriate additional funds to schools based on student needs. The House added an additional $58 million to begin the transition to the new model.
SB 111, also sponsored by Orr, would appropriate $375 million over three years for that transition, which aims to get more money to students with particular needs, including children in poverty and English Language Learners.
The budget also includes $135 million for the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that will award students with funds to be used for education-related expenses, including private school tuition. The program was initially slated to get $100 million, but Orr said that demand for the program led the chairs to increase the allocation.
The program is currently limited to special needs students and those making under 300% of the poverty line, about $79,950 for a family of three. The program will be open to all applicants starting in 2027, without any income limits. About two-thirds of the 37,000 applicants for the program this year are already in private school or homeschooled.
“I realize that there’s different opinions about school choice,” Garrett said. “We have the CHOOSE Act, and we’re committed to that. But we are committing more than that funding into the public schools. And I think that what we’re doing, especially looking at student needs, is very, very important.”
There are also additional line items for workmen’s compensation for educators, SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville; and paid parental leave, SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile.
Teachers will receive $1,000 for classroom supplies, and the state will allocate $100 per student for textbooks. Teachers will not get a raise this year, but Garrett said the education community wanted an increase in the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan. There is a $99.2 million increase in PEEHIP.
“What we were hearing from the education community was that they really wanted that PEEHIP increase covered, and that’s almost $100 million out of the budget,” he said.
The Alabama Math, Science and Technology Initiative will see a 31% ($32.2 million) funding increase while the Alabama Reading Initiative’s (ARI) funding would grow by 6.4% ($9 million). The two programs’ funds remain unchanged from what the Senate passed earlier this month.
State Superintendent Eric Mackey supported the budget and hopes they pass smoothly. 
“I think they’ve done their homework,” he said. “ They’ve found the right balance.”
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said the House would vote on the ETF on Thursday.

The bill (SF186) could help Minnesota schools struggling to attract and retain teachers, but the proposal must compete with a slew of other spending priorities as lawmakers craft a two-year budget — with a gloomy budget forecast on the horizon.
More than 70,000 licensed public and charter school teachers would be eligible for the $1,200 tax credit, which would increase annually with inflation, at a cost of about $100 million per year to the state, according to an estimate by the Department of Revenue.
“I know that this is a hefty price tag,” said bill author Sen. Heather Gustafson, DFL-Vadnais Heights. “But if we want to actually do something for public school teachers, then it’s going to cost us something and it’s got to come from somewhere.”
Gustafson, who taught high school history before entering the Legislature in 2023, said the tax credit would be particularly meaningful for early-career teachers, who are often managing student debt while earning a starting salary that averages about $43,000, according to the National Education Association.
School principals would also be eligible for the credit, though private and homeschool teachers would not.
Senate Taxes Committee Chair Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, proposed during a Tuesday committee hearing that the bonuses be restricted to full-time instructors, which would whittle down the cost of what she called a “very expensive” bill. It was laid over for possible inclusion in a larger tax bill that will be negotiated in the next month before the Legislature adjourns for the year.
The bill would offset potential losses teachers will face if state lawmakers go along with Gov. Tim Walz’s proposal to phase out the alternative teacher pay system known as Q Comp, which provides additional funding to participating school districts that adopt performance pay and invest in teacher development and evaluation.
Walz’s administration noted the 20-year-old program provides additional funding to districts serving just half the state’s population and argue it has become duplicative of newer teacher development and evaluation requirements. Eliminating the program would save the state more than $80 million a year.
Some Democrats and the teachers union want the state to think even bigger about increasing teacher pay by creating wage floors for licensed teachers and support staff.
A separate DFL bill in the House (HF3119) would set the minimum salary for licensed full-time teachers at $60,000. Full-time teachers with master’s degrees would be entitled to at least $80,000 a year and those with 10-years of experience on top of an advanced degree would earn at least $100,000. The bill also sets a minimum wage floor for hourly school workers like paraprofessionals, cafeteria workers and bus drivers at $25 an hour.
The bill, which could cost upwards of $250 million a year, is not expected to be considered this year after missing a key legislative deadline.
Still, Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, DFL-Minneapolis, said the bill lays the groundwork for future negotiations at the Capitol about raising teacher pay to help address the staffing shortages afflicting an estimated 8 out of 10 schools in the state.
“I want people who, to me, are doing the hardest work of educating our children eight hours a day to be well-compensated,” said Sencer-Mura, the bill’s chief author.
The bill would raise wages for a significant portion of the state’s teachers, about half of whom earn less than $65,000, according to the Department of Employment and Economic Development.
She pointed out that the starting salary of a Minneapolis police officer is now $90,000, which proponents justified because of the job’s difficulty, responsibility and accountability.
“I think we ask the same thing for teachers, right?” Sencer-Mura said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/KidsinSchool-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 08:07:58.534274

[…]","Elon Musk at a cabinet meeting at the White House April 10. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Elon Musk took his chainsaw last month to federal grants for mental health  – including two that provide free mental health counseling to youth in Elko and Humboldt Counties, where access to such services is scarce, according to UNLV’s Dr. Dan Allen, director and principal investigator of the Nevada Rural Mental Health Outreach Program (RHOP). DOGE also eliminated another grant for the mental health needs of homeless children. 
Allen says he was notified of the cuts via a letter last month from the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH).  
Eliminated grants include those awarded to UNLV Partnership for Research, Assessment, Counseling, Therapy and Innovative Clinical Education (PRACTICE), a mental health clinic at UNLV that provides care to populations that have difficulty accessing help, and turns out trained mental health providers in the process. 
Those programs are just a few of the mental health treatment services terminated by President Donald Trump’s administration on March 24. Others, according to a letter from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto to Health and Human Services Sec. Robert F. Kennedy, include “crisis support hotlines, community-based initiatives, peer support services, and workforce training to support individuals in crisis and ensure continuity of care.” 
“Preliminary calculations show about $8.4 million was terminated under pandemic-era additions to the community mental health services block grant,” Jesse Stone of DPBH said via email Tuesday. “This number is subject to change as we receive final requests from reimbursements from our partners that were receiving grants at the time that funds were rescinded.”
Trump’s administration hopes to save $11.4 billion by eliminating COVID-era funding for addiction and mental health. 
“These grants were issued for a limited purpose: To ameliorate the effects of the pandemic,” says the termination notice from Trump’s administration. “The end of the pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants are no longer necessary.” 
The pandemic exposed multiple shortcomings in health care services and programs nationally, not least with respect to accessing affordable mental and behavioral health care.
Nevada suffered from a dearth of mental health professionals and services prior to the pandemic, and continues to do so even though the pandemic has ended. 
One of the RHOP programs that is losing funding provided telehealth services to youth in their own school setting, with the assistance of Communities in Schools, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fulfilling the needs of Nevada students. 
“We’re also providing services to kids who need more intensive care,” Allen explained, through a clinical program for youth at high-risk for psychosis, and for those with early bipolar disorder.  
“Our community is plagued with mental illness,” Elko resident Morgan Pavao, who serves as a site coordinator for Communities in Schools in Northeastern Nevada, said via email. “I have lost family and loved ones to suicide every year because we live in a community where mental health is not only ignored, but stigmatized. This program is saving lives and we cannot afford to lose it.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who emphasized a commitment to mental health matters in his State of the State speech in January, did not respond to requests for comment on whether he plans to replace the programs with state funding.
‘When do I speak with my person?’
The grants for services provided by UNLV PRACTICE were funded by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), says Dr. Michelle Paul, executive director of UNLV PRACTICE.
The funding, awarded in 2023, “enabled UNLV PRACTICE to significantly expand its existing telehealth services, allowing us to offer year-round care and screening for high-risk youth in Northeastern Nevada,” Paul said, adding she learned in March the funding was terminated, effective immediately. “With the sudden cessation of funding, services for approximately two-thirds of participants were affected immediately. Thanks to a generous donor, we were able to soften the landing for those youth and their families during the abrupt transition.”
Services for the remaining one-third of students “have been temporarily sustained through short-term institutional support from UNLV and are expected to conclude in May,” Paul said, adding the cuts are also taking a toll on post-graduate training and support opportunities for future mental health care providers in training at UNLV PRACTICE. 
The telehealth services provided care to 35 students this semester, says Liz Carrasco, the program’s clinical director. “Last semester we had 150 students,” she said, adding the loss of the grants comes as residents in both counties are recovering from teen suicides earlier this year. Suicide has long been among the leading causes of death for Nevadans aged 8-17 and 18-24, according to the Office of Suicide Prevention. 
Students are referred to the program by school counselors, administrators, or social workers, and complete an “extensive referral packet” that helps UNLV determine whether telehealth counseling is appropriate, says Alexandra Paredes, a Winnemucca resident who coordinates the program on behalf of Communities in Schools. 
Students, she says, call their clinician their “‘person.’ They’re always asking ‘when do I speak with my person?’ They form a very strong bond.”   
The grants were slated to run out at the end of September, says Allen, who says he’ll apply for block grants as an alternative.  
“All that funding has been cut back, so I’m not sure what’s going to be available,” he said during a phone interview Monday. “But that’s our climate.”
DOGE also eliminated a grant funded via ARPA that was to be administered beginning in September by UNLV’s Education Department and run through UNLV PRACTICE for the benefit of homeless youth. Efforts are underway to find alternative funding, Allen and Paul said. 
The lost funding across all three grants amounts to about $634,000, according to Paul. 
“The State of Nevada has received approximately $15 million in Community Health Services Block Grant funding from the American Rescue Plan since it was passed,” Lauren Wodarski, spokesperson for Cortez Masto, said via email. ”The Trump Administration has yet to offer concrete details on specifically how much of that funding has been frozen or rescinded – and Senator Cortez Masto is continuing to push for answers.”
The Reno Gazette Journal reported earlier this month that Renown Health suspended mental health services at its Crisis Care Center in Reno after the federal government terminated its grant funding last month.
Cortez Masto, in the letter to Kennedy, demanded answers about the rationale for terminating block grant funding for Nevada’s mental health services months before it was set to expire. 
“This abrupt decision to cut critical, already-allocated funding is alarming and poses a direct threat to the mental health and well-being of Nevadans,” Cortez Masto wrote of the cuts, which were made the same day the UNLV PRACTICE programs were eliminated and were also set to expire in September.
Cortez Masto wants to know whether HHS analyzed the effects of ending the funding prematurely; what the federal government is doing to sustain the affected programs; how the government will avoid gaps and delays in care for individuals currently in treatment; and what alternative funding sources are available for the state. 
“We’re of course disappointed by this loss of funding, as these programs provided momentum to UNLV PRACTICE’s ability to deliver crucial mental health services to rural communities in Nevada while training the next generation of providers,” she said, adding the clinic remains “committed to delivering high-quality and accessible programs to residents in our community and throughout Nevada.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2209597675-1024x658.jpg,,,2025-04-23 08:07:58.534274

(Photo by Andrew Kitchenman/Alaska Beacon)When the state of Alaska seized a bootlegger’s plane, it did not violate the U.S. Constitution’s excessive fines clause, the Alaska Supreme Court has ruled.
The ruling, published Friday, involves a 13-year-old dispute that followed the conviction of Kenneth Jouppi for attempting to transport beer from Fairbanks to Beaver, an Interior Alaska town that has outlawed the importation, sale and possession of alcohol.  
Jouppi operated an air service and was transporting a passenger who had loaded 72 cans of beer as cargo. Troopers said Jouppi was aware of at least one six-pack and thus knowingly transported alcohol, something Jouppi contested at trial.
The state attempted to seize Jouppi’s airplane as a result of the conviction, but the trial court denied that seizure, citing state law. The state appealed, and the Alaska Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the seizure, remanding the case back to the trial court.
The trial court again declined to rule in favor of the seizure, this time citing the U.S. Constitution, and the state appealed to the Supreme Court. 
“We hold, as a matter of law, that the owner of the airplane failed to establish that forfeiture would be unconstitutionally excessive,” wrote Justice Jude Pate on behalf of the court, which ruled unanimously. 
“Forfeiture of the airplane constituted a fine within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause, and … the forfeiture is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the harm caused by the offense,” he wrote.
The decision was based upon a U.S. Supreme Court case known as United States v. Bajakajian, which set up a two-part test to determine whether a fine is excessive: The fine must be intended as punishment, and it cannot be disproportional to the crime.
Citing legislative debates, the Alaska Supreme Court’s new ruling says that lawmakers intended aircraft-related smuggling to be subject to greater penalties than other ways of bootlegging.
In addition, the ruling says that the harm caused by alcohol to rural Alaska means that severe punishment is not disproportionate.
“Alcohol abuse in rural Alaska leads to increased crime; disorders, such as alcoholism; conditions, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; and death, imposing substantial costs on public health and the administration of justice. Within this context, it is clear that the illegal importation of even a six-pack of beer causes grave societal harm,” the ruling states. “This factor strongly suggests that the forfeiture is not grossly disproportional.”
The Alaska Supreme Court’s ruling sends the case back to the Court of Appeals for further work.

William Lewis Moore, a postal worker from Baltimore, decided to march from Chattanooga to Mississippi’s capital during his one-person march against segregation, wearing a sandwich board that read, “Equal Rights for All” and “Mississippi Or Bust.” 
Instead, a Klansman gunned him down in Attala, Alabama, shooting him twice in the head with a .22 rifle. The Klansman believed to have killed him went unpunished. 
Moore, who was raised in Mississippi, had planned to deliver a letter to Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett that read, “Do not go down in infamy as one who fought the democracy for all which you have not the power to prevent. … The white man cannot be truly free himself until all men have their rights. Each is dependent upon the other.” 
Folk singer Phil Ochs wrote a song about Moore, among the 40 martyrs listed on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama. In 2003, Mary Stanton wrote a book on Moore’s journey, “Freedom Walk: Mississippi or Burst.” Seven years later, his hometown in Binghamton, New York, built a plaque to honor him.

(Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)A simmering disagreement between Alabama’s current and former top election officials has erupted into a public and personal feud between Secretary of State Wes Allen and his predecessor, John Merrill, with both trading accusations of dishonesty and misrepresentation.
The dispute centers on the management of Alabama’s voter rolls, Allen’s withdrawal of the state from a multi-state voter data consortium and claims of success in cleaning voter lists, which Merrill contested. 
The exchange between the two Republicans escalated rapidly from policy disagreements to sharp personal attacks involving past scandals.

Merrill said in a phone interview Tuesday morning that there has not been any incident previously that would have violated the public’s trust in a system historically used by a majority of states.
“They have actually used their campaign to promote Secretary Allen personally, because he was the only person that spoke about the initiative,” Merrill said.
Merrill penned an opinion column on Sunday challenging statements Allen made in recent press releases and during congressional testimony about the state of Alabama’s voter rolls when Allen took office. Merrill, who served two terms as Secretary of State from 2015 to 2023, accused Allen of mischaracterizing the state of the voter rolls he inherited and inflating his administration’s accomplishments.
“Since taking office in 2023, Secretary Allen has repeatedly mischaracterized both my tenure and the work of the professionals in the Secretary of State’s Office,” Merrill wrote in the opinion column. “He has overstated his efforts in ‘clearing up’ the voter rolls, inflating numbers, and presenting a misleading picture of the state’s voter rolls.”
Merrill specifically took issue with Allen’s claim that the state voter file was a “bloated mess” and that Allen’s new system, the Alabama Voter Integrity Database (AVID), allowed the removal of over half a million ineligible voters since taking office. AVID replaced Alabama’s participation in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a data-sharing program used by dozens of states to identify voters who have moved or died.
In the phone interview, he criticized Allen for an attempt last year to remove 3,200 voters from the rolls prior to the presidential election after alleging they were living in the country without authorization. A federal judge blocked Allen’s action, saying it took place after a deadline to make election changes.
“After the actual investigation was conducted, it was determined that most of the people that had been ordered to be removed were actually US citizens and were here legally, and that was a major problem,” Merrill said.
Allen provided a brief response Tuesday afternoon.
“I will never apologize for ensuring only United States citizens vote in Alabama elections,” Allen wrote.
Merrill argued that the core components Allen touts as part of AVID – using data from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, the U.S. Postal Service’s National Change of Address file, Social Security death data, and agreements with other states – were already in use during his administration, alongside ERIC. He said that AVID lacks a key feature of ERIC, including identifying potential instances of voters casting ballots in multiple states during the same election cycle.
“I agree with John Merrill,” said David Kimball, a professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who conducts research on election administration, in an email Tuesday afternoon, adding that ERIC allows a state to compare its voter file with those from every state that is part of the ERIC network, which is a majority of U.S. states.
Merrill also challenged Allen’s figures, saying that that official state data shows a net increase of nearly 67,000 registered voters since Allen took office, adding that the numbers dont reflect current voter registration data. Merrill said that to reach the current total after such removals, Allen’s office would have had to register an average number of new voters far exceeding the yearly average achieved during Merrill’s tenure.
“The math does not add up,” Merrill said.
Allen’s response dismissed Merrill’s policy. 
“Unfortunately, it is not surprising that a man whose time in office was marked by obscene sodomy scandals and repeated lies to the people that he was elected to serve, would not hesitate to press send on a false statement,” Allen stated in a response to questions from Yellowhammer News. Merrill in 2021 acknowledged to al.com that he had an “inappropriate relationship” with a woman who was not his wife. The revelation led Merrill to end a campaign for U.S. Senate. 
Allen, who plans to run for lieutenant governor in 2026, said 591,915 new voters registered since January 2023, slightly more than Merrill had estimated would be needed. He characterized Merrill’s defense of ERIC as defending a “liberal organization” and criticized Merrill’s past meetings with figures like independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and officials in Russia and China during his time in office.
Merrill Tuesday called Allen’s response “name-calling, innuendo, and personal attacks” that did not address points raised about voter roll management and AVID.
Merrill framed past infidelity mentioned by Allen as an opportunity to speak about forgiveness and redemption, stating he had worked to restore relationships and forgiven Allen for the attacks.
“I have also been able to forgive Secretary Allen for his personal attacks on me, which included using derogatory names and condemning my past instead of offering the support a Christian brother should provide,” he said.

A Chilton County jury convicted Osgood, 55, on two counts of capital murder in 2014. According to court documents, Osgood and his girlfriend at the time, Tonya Van Dyke, accompanied Brown to her home where the two eventually sexually assaulted and murdered her.
Van Dyke was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for her role in Brown’s death.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the trial court in 2016 after ruling that the judge at the trial made an error when giving instructions to the jury.
As the trial court was set to begin with jury selection however, Osgood waived empaneling the jury, saying he believes in “an eye for an eye,” and the circuit court once again imposed the death penalty.
Gov. Kay Ivey announced in a news release published in March that she had scheduled Osgood’s execution for this week after the Alabama Supreme Court granted a motion filed by the Alabama Attorney General’s Office in February to have Osgood put to death.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”





In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.
But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/manufacturing-Sumuri.jpg,,,2025-04-23 08:07:58.534274

Regardless, dozens of constituents of Barrett’s 7th Congressional District gathered at the UA Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 333 in South Lansing to vent their frustrations about the policies and changes initiated by the Trump administration.
Harold Pope, president of the Lansing branch of the NAACP, took the microphone to start the town hall and emphasized Barret’s absence, which was greeted by a chorus of boos.

“What is more important is that you care, you are here tonight, and why are we here tonight is to hear you, your voices, and your concerns, so we take those concerns way back to Rep. Barrett, so he can do the work. It’d be nice if he were here, so he could take our feedback,” said Pope.

While several Democratic and Republican Michigan politicians were invited, the event was attended in person by only five Democratic lawmakers; State Reps. Julie Brixie (D-Meridian Township), Kara Hope (D-Holt), Jennifer Conlin (D-Ann Arbor Township), Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing), and state Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing).
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), and State Reps. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), Angela Witwer (D-Delta Township), and  Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) did not attend the meeting, but did send representatives.
Barrett’s absence fueled attendees’ frustration and concerns at the event and once they were invited to speak during the open mic, began writing down their remarks as people formed a line to speak.
Barrett’s assigned seat, a few feet in front of the microphone, remained as an empty chair in front of the microphones during the two-hour-long time that the town hall continued.
The community members’ comments covered diverse topics including taxes, deportation of immigrants, the impeachment trial against Trump, Medicaid, and Social Security, among other concerns that were targeted toward Barrett’s empty chair.

“We are being lied to. We have to watch closely what they are doing. They are going around our Social Security, they’re gonna cut stuff, they’re gonna cut funds, and then they’re gonna say Social Security doesn’t work, we have to privatize it”, said Janet Roemer, 76, during her speech, which received enthusiastic applause from the crowd. “And the only way we’re gonna stop this is if we make our congress people more afraid of us than they are of Trump.”
Some members of the public expressed frustration at Barrett’s absence, arguing that he was not doing his job as a representative of the people.
 “We’re the ones paying their salaries; they live off our taxes, so they should represent us. But as you can see, he [Barrett] isn’t here. That’s just wrong,” said Lorenzo Lopez, a Lansing activist and resident.

Around 8 p.m., the event came to an end, leaving behind the emotional speeches in which some left the microphone with their voices breaking.
“The fear. Being 76, and being afraid all the time, are they gonna take my Social Security? Are they gonna take my Medicare? And how am I gonna survive?” added Roemer as the town hall wrapped up.
A request for comment was sent to Congressman Barrett’s office, but has yet to be returned.

I hope we can rediscover the love for our neighbors that Jesus tried to teach us.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rev. Devon Thomas: Our nation needs a resurrection.","This commentary is by Rev. Devon Thomas, pastor of the Ascension Lutheran Church in South Burlington.Last week was Holy Week, and the detainment of both Rümeysa Öztürk and Mohsen Mahdawi, as well as the refusal to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, took up the headlines. It may feel coincidental that this was all happening as Christians remembered the unjust detainment, trial and execution of our Lord and Savior, but it is not insignificant.Many Vermonters believe our democracy has been sliding into authoritarianism, but now we’re seeing it firsthand. All of us should be in opposition to this blatant attack on due process and our First Amendment right to protest and free expression. As a Pastor and a Christian, I must personally express my dismay and disappointment that so many people who profess to follow Jesus Christ would choose to defend this injustice, hiding behind the Cross of Jesus without understanding what that Cross represents.There is a reason Christians represent themselves with the symbol of a tool for execution. The Cross represents the totalitarian powers of the world and the blatant authoritarianism that Jesus entered Jerusalem to protest. As we celebrated Easter, we remembered that Jesus put his life on the line to protest the unethical and unjust mistreatment of the poor, women, migrants, the sick and people of other faith traditions. Jesus welcomed all people to his table, asking them to share food with him in a spirit of fellowship and love. Jesus criticized those who would leave others to suffer while at the same time hoarding privilege and wealth for themselves. “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside also may become clean.” (Matt 23:25-26).Holy Week served as a reminder of the love and justice Jesus embodied, and resurrected after Christ’s death on the cross.We are living through a time where those who would honestly listen to the teachings of Jesus Christ should be able to see some frightening parallels. A Christian should know what Jesus would call us to do in this moment, where civil liberty and human rights are eroding around us. No U.S. administration should have the power to arbitrarily send U.S. residents to an El Salvadorian prison camp, as this administration has done to Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Because of Holy Week, I must recognize that I have a responsibility as a follower of Christ and a citizen of this nation to loudly and publicly condemn the actions of this administration and its use of ICE to infringe upon the rights of our U.S. residents. I know that I share the feelings of most Vermont residents in saying what has happened to Mohsen Mahdawi, Rümeysa Öztürk and Kilmar Abrego Garcia could very soon be happening to any of us who choose to speak against this administration’s actions.I will close this letter by reminding my neighbors that Holy Week was a time of hope for the resurrection. Even though a loving and compassionate person like Jesus was unjustly executed, Christians profess that love will be resurrected. I think our nation needs a resurrection right now, and I hope we can rediscover the love for our neighbors that Jesus tried to teach us.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rev.

When law enforcement uses intimidation and secrecy instead of transparency and legal process, it does more than erode public trust. It puts our entire system at risk.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Laura Sibilia: Due Process, Free Speech and Legal Presence.","This commentary is by Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover. She serves on the House Energy and Technology Committee and is Co-Chair of the Vermont General Assembly’s Rural Caucus and Vermont National Guard and Veterans Affairs Caucus.Our Systems Are in TroubleRecent detentions of legally present individuals — including a Turkish doctoral student and a Palestinian resident of Vermont — raise urgent questions about whether our institutions are upholding core American principles like due process, free speech, and equal protection under the law.These aren’t just immigration cases. They’re about whether people in Vermont and across the United States can rely on our legal systems to work fairly, regardless of their background or beliefs.When Due Process Breaks Down Close to HomeTake Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder who has lived in Vermont since 2014. He had a citizenship interview scheduled for April 14. Instead of completing the process, he was taken by hooded plainclothes ICE agents in handcuffs from the USCIS office in Colchester. He wasn’t charged with a crime. According to his lawyers, the government is seeking his removal based on political speech he engaged in as a student organizer at Columbia University.Rümeysa Öztürk, a doctoral student in Massachusetts, was detained and transferred to Vermont. She has not been charged with a crime either. Her co-authorship of an op-ed found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus. Both individuals were in the country legally and are protected by the U.S. Constitution.Due Process Is Not OptionalThe government cannot detain or deport people without fair process. That’s not a political opinion, it’s a legal standard guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. These rights apply to all people on U.S. soil, not just citizens. Courts have upheld this principle time and time again.Due process means the right to know the charges against you, to access legal counsel, and to be heard in court. Transferring people across state lines before they can speak to a lawyer or judge undermines those rights and erodes trust in the entire legal system. There is growing evidence of federal authorities using such tactics without notifying legal representatives.The First Amendment Applies to EveryoneFreedom of speech and assembly aren’t limited to citizens. These rights are guaranteed to all people in the United States. If these detentions are in any way connected to peaceful protests or political expression—especially on issues like war, human rights, or foreign policy—then the government’s actions are not just alarming. They’re unconstitutional.As Vermont Congresswoman Becca Balint said: “Without due process and the right to free speech, this is not the America we thought we lived in.”Legal Presence Comes in Many FormsThere’s no single definition of being “legally in the U.S.” It includes:Citizens – Born in the U.S. or naturalized
Green card holders – Lawful permanent residents like Mr. Mahdawi
Student visa holders – People in the U.S. for education, like Ms. Öztürk
Asylum seekers and refugees – Individuals fleeing persecution or violence
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients – From countries facing crisisIn these recent cases, both detainees were legally present. And even for those who are undocumented, the Constitution still applies. They still have the right to due process, to free speech, and to humane treatment.Vermont’s Role and ResponsibilityThese detentions are not abstract for Vermonters. State Senator Becca White was present when Mr. Mahdawi was taken. The Vermont Senate is reviewing the state’s relationship with ICE. Governor Phil Scott has expressed concern about the treatment of detainees in out-of-state ICE facilities, a concern shared by many in our state.Vermont cannot directly control federal enforcement, but we can and should review any agreements between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies. The state has the power to demand transparency and ensure that people have access to legal representation. We should not be complicit in violating civil liberties or using federal power to silence dissent.Why This MattersThese incidents aren’t isolated; they’re signs of deeper stress on the democratic systems meant to hold power in check. No one should face deportation for protesting a war. No one should be taken from a citizenship interview in a van with no markings, no explanation and no access to counsel.What happened to Mohsen Mahdawi and Rümeysa Öztürk may not meet the strict definition of human trafficking, but the methods — hooded agents, transporting uncharged individuals across state lines without legal access — violate democratic norms and constitutional rights. When law enforcement uses intimidation and secrecy instead of transparency and legal process, it does more than erode public trust. It puts our entire system at risk.If you’re looking for ways to help, consider supporting the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP) or AALV, organizations that provide legal and integration support for Vermont’s immigrant and refugee communities.We must do better. Upholding the Constitution isn’t about abstract ideals, it’s about action, accountability and protecting the systems meant to protect all of us.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep.

(Screenshot from news conference video)Reports of antisemitic incidents more than doubled in Indiana last year, according to a study released Tuesday. Hoosier Jewish community leaders gathered to denounce the results as “deeply alarming” at an afternoon news conference in Indianapolis.
“These are not just statistics. It’s a wake-up call,” said Jeff Linkon, executive director of Indiana University’s chapter of Hillel International. “It tells us that antisemitism is not just rising. It is emboldened. It’s becoming more visible, more public, and yes, more dangerous.”
The Anti-Defamation League’s annual “Audit of Antisemitic Incidents” tabulated more than 9,000 incidents nationally in 2024 — the highest since tabulations began in 1979. For the first time, a majority were related to Israel or Zionism.

Of 142 incidents reported in Indiana in 2024:
Assault: 0
Harassment: 116
Vandalism: 26
Source: Anti-Defamation League Audit of Antisemitic Incidents 2024

That includes 142 incidents reported in Indiana, more than double the 59 incidents recorded in 2023. The Hoosier state only counted 33 in 2022 and 16 in 2021.
“Why the increase?” asked David Goldenberg, who leads the league’s Midwest chapter.
He acknowledged the league is “doing a better job” tracking incidents, and more people are reporting them. But underreporting “remains part of the problem.”
“The larger story, though, is the Jewish community is being targeted with hate in ways that we have not experienced in generations,” Goldenberg said.
The increase aligns with a 2023 attack on Israel by several Palestinian militant groups — in which more than 1,200 civilians and soldiers were killed, per Israel — that sparked a still-raging war. Since then, more than 50,000 Palestinian civilians and combatants and 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed, Reuters reported.
Also in 2023, the league changed its methodology to include “certain expressions of opposition to Zionism” in the study, plus support for violent resistance to Israel or Zionists.
The league uses incident reports from victims, law enforcement, the media and partner organizations. One of two conditions must apply: “circumstances indicate anti-Jewish animus on the part of the perpetrator” or one could “plausibly conclude that they have been victimized due to their Jewish identity.”
“The annual audit provides us more than just critical data,” Linkon said. “It gives us clarity and direction, and it reminds us that combating antisemitism is not just a Jewish responsibility, it’s a community responsibility.”
  A whopping 58% of incidents reported nationwide involved Israel or Zionism. (From Anti-Defamation League)
Goldenberg, meanwhile, called for a “whole-society” approach featuring government and educational institution involvement.
He described a March executive order from Indiana Gov. Mike Braun as a “good example of the role that government can play to create safe spaces for students,” but added, “We would encourage him to do more.”
University administrators also “need to do more,” Goldenberg continued, although he congratulated IU — a former site of major protests — and Purdue University on their work.
“Third, and perhaps most importantly, it’s something that we can all do: we can all speak out when we see hate and we see anti semitism be directed towards someone who is Jewish,” he said. “Don’t say silent. Speak out. Challenge it.”

Indiana lawmakers face difficult choices as they iron out the final details of the next biennial spending plan. With revenue growth forecasted to be minimal, the General Assembly is balancing myriad pressures – leading to debates about property taxes, universal school choice, public health funding and Medicaid.
But in all these debates about numbers, our leaders must not lose sight of the thousands of Hoosier kids and families who are waiting for access to child care through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). By investing in these families – as Gov. Mike Braun has advocated in his budget – we’ll generate a massive economic return for our state and the working families who reside here.
Indiana loses billions each year by failing to provide comprehensive early childhood education investments. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation report showed that insufficient child care capacity costs Indiana over $4.2 billion annually in lost business productivity and foregone income tax revenue from household employment interruptions. Early childhood education is one of the best investments a state can make, as national reports show between a $4 and $9 return on every dollar invested in such programs.
Nearly a third of Hoosiers have experienced changes to their employment status due to lack of child care access, including reductions in hours, turning down promotions or new positions, and losing their jobs or leaving the workforce altogether. And since an announcement from the Family and Social Services Administration last December, more than 10,000 low-income kids are currently waiting for a voucher through CCDF.
Report: state loses out on $4.2B annually due to child care shortage

What else is at risk to Hoosiers if we don’t fund child care? Thousands more children are at risk of not having their CCDF vouchers renewed if the state fails to adequately fund the program in the next biennium. Former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration took many steps to increase access to the program, including expanding eligibility for low-income families and child care workers, but these updates often relied on one-time federal funding that has now been spent. If we fail to fund these families who currently rely on the CCDF vouchers, they will likely lose access to care.
That could imperil the financial viability of hundreds of child care providers if families lose their ability to pay for care, further damaging Indiana’s already limited child care capacity, according to a recent analysis by Early Learning Indiana. Closures of providers would also impact families who do not rely on CCDF, as providers would struggle to maintain staff ratios and group sizes without enough enrolled students. A lack of funding in one area of the system creates instability in other parts, and instability hurts Hoosier families and businesses alike.
Braun’s budget proposal contained a tremendous amount of support for early learning, including over $369 million for CCDF, nearly doubling funding for the state’s On My Way Pre-K program, and the creation of a local child care assistance program to support local efforts to increase child care seats. It also included $600,000 annually to support pre-K services for blind and low-vision kids. These are the kinds of proposals that would help deliver on the governor’s commitments to equip the next generation of Hoosiers through education and improve quality of life and economic opportunity for Hoosier families.
Ambitious plans and proposals have been and will continue to be floated, and questions about how to pay for it all will continue until a final budget is passed. No doubt there are many worthy and important demands for state funding.
As the General Assembly moves forward, it’s key for lawmakers to recognize how vital child care is to Indiana’s economic prosperity and household productivity. Now, more than ever, Hoosier families need the state’s support.

At 2 p.m. last Wednesday, word got out in Vicksburg of the firing of about 350 young adult volunteers from across the country who, between deployments to render aid in fire- and hurricane-ravaged areas, called the city’s AmeriCorps campus their home base.
A day later, locals welcomed these members of the National Civilian Community Corps to a feast funded by donations, complete with cheesy chicken spaghetti contributed by a church, four types of meat from Tommy’s BBQ and brownies from what one attendee called “the table of regret.”
Many volunteers emerged from the kitchen balancing three plates, walking between two cheering “appreciation lines” to the picnic tables.
“I didn’t want them to go home not feeling loved and not feeling appreciated,” said Christine Rials, one of the organizers of the dinner.
NCCC members nationwide were terminated last week as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government. The program, which was set to receive $42.7 million during fiscal year 2025, received $33.7 million in fiscal year 2024: less than a hundredth of a percent of the country’s $1.8 billion budget. It is unclear whether AmeriCorps’ other programs will be affected.
Before the firings, members were scattered across AmeriCorps’ Southern region, which covers 20 states and territories, and beyond. Over the past year, they were “mucking and gutting” buildings in the wake of early April’s deadly floods in Kentucky and putting out “hot spots” along the perimeter of September’s Silver Spoon Fire in Wyoming. And they were in rural western North Carolina the day after Hurricane Helene tore through, going door to door to sign people up for disaster relief and help manage their cases.
Volunteers asked not to be named because AmeriCorps has directed members not to talk with news organizations until they are formally discharged at the end of the month.
“For the last nine months, we’ve been turning friends into family,” said one member, who was scheduled to complete his service next month. “It’s a very rushed ending to something that means so much to a lot of us.”
A Zoom call relaying the news cut some members’ workdays short, interrupting projects in which volunteers had taken leading roles.
“It was just a normal afternoon, and then all of a sudden they’re like, ‘Alright guys, pack up tonight, ship out tomorrow, and we’ll see you on campus,” said another member.
“We were deep into the work,” said a third member, whose team was assisting the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, D.C. “And to just stop immediately, when we were almost a whole team – and at that point they trusted us. They’re trying to figure out how they’re going to finish what we were working on.” 
The NCCC, established by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators in 1992, was modeled after the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps, which employed more than 3 million over the course of nine years. Vicksburg has been home to the NCCC’s Southern region since 2009.
Savannah Boyer, a 2023-24 NCCC member, said the program helps provide a crucial “second wave” of disaster response, following first responders, that often goes unnoticed. 
“I think people forget that what goes into a disaster is not just the people who are first there,” Boyer said. “It takes years and months of recovery efforts…. I’m not sure how bad it will be, but I know the impact of the missing work will be felt for sure.”
Boyer and others from the Vicksburg campus were deployed to Maui to run a donation distribution center for survivors of the 2023 Hawaiian wildfires. 
A current NCCC member, who worked in fire management over the past year, said that fighting a fire on the front lines is “always the fun part. Where a lot of the volunteers come in is the boring part afterward.” That includes reinforcing barriers to prevent the fire from reigniting.
In a city with a strong contingent of federal workers – at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ district headquarters and Engineer Research and Development Center, as well as Vicksburg National Military Park – AmeriCorps members participated in a culture of public service, community members said.
“Everywhere there’s a need, they’re out there,” said retired Brig. Gen. Robert Crear.
Crear said he has worked with NCCC members as president of the Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park on clean-up projects. When Crear led the Army Corps of Engineers’ recovery and restoration efforts after Hurricane Katrina, he said, AmeriCorps members took on “whatever they were given a mission to do.”
“To me, they just represent all that’s good in the next generation coming up,” said Jeanine Hall, a Vicksburg resident since 1971 who attended the dinner to wish the volunteers well. “Character, faith, work ethic, compassion…. You know, just the total opposite of waste, fraud and abuse.”
Current members at the Thursday dinner said they volunteered in Vicksburg’s Mardi Gras festivities, culled books at a local middle school and helped with charity runs hosted by the Southern Cultural Heritage Foundation and Grace Christian Counseling Center. According to a 2024 AmeriCorps report, in the preceding year, NCCC members had assisted with controlled burns and endangered species protection in Homochitto National Forest and helped build houses and a skills depot at Itawamba Crossroads Ranch, a residential community for special needs adults in Fulton.
Last summer, NCCC team leaders led a field day for Vicksburg area seventh-graders who attended Camp Discovery, said Michele Connelly, executive director of the United Way of West Central Mississippi, which hosted the summer camp.
“The children at the camp realized that there is a world outside of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and how awesome it is that all of these people from all over the nation come here to our community to give back,” Connelly said.
Boyer worked on a team that rehabilitated the Edwards Neighborhood Service Center in western Hinds County in November and December 2023 in partnership with the Hinds County Human Resource Agency. The building had flooded repeatedly after a severe storm damaged the roof. The team of seven removed water and stripped, primed and painted the walls.

“It was fantastic to have them with us,” said Melverta Bender, vice president for planning and development at the Hinds County agency. “They worked from the ceiling to the floor…. It would have taken significant time had we needed to pull staff from the agency to do it.”
Long-time Edwards residents stopped by to visit volunteers and share memories of when the building was a school, Bender said.
Boyer, now in college and considering a career in environmental law, said she worries the country will lose more than NCCC members’ service.
“What this program is building is people who are going to lead the community after they’re done, these types of people who are building careers in public service,” Boyer said. “I think we’ll see lasting impacts if they do decide not to bring NCCC back, from not just the work, but the people it creates after it’s done.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/22092804/IMG_2538.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s gas and electric utilities will be required to inform certain customers of their energy use and costs before monthly bills are issued under a bill Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law Tuesday.
The bill is a bid to allow customers to adjust their usage to avoid unforeseen spikes in utility costs. It comes after shockingly high utility bills seen this winter, bills that are expected to rise again after rate increases add roughly $25 to monthly bills beginning in June.
“The sticker shock of large utility bills at the end of the month can be unaffordable for working families trying to manage household finances,” said bill sponsor Assemblyman David Bailey (D-Gloucester). “The early notifications will give them the ability to adjust their usage and prevent surprise bills that break their budgets.”
Under the new law, utilities must inform customers of the cost of their electricity and the amount of kilowatt hours or therms they’ve used by text message or email on the 10th and 20th days of a billing cycle.
It requires that they allow customers to sign up for a separate notice when their average daily electric or gas usage exceeds averages from the prior month or during the same month in the prior year.
It will also require utility bills to break out costs for tariffs, fees, and taxes, including distribution charges and the state’s societal benefits charge. Utilities already separate out some of that information.
The bill, which will take effect in 90 days, comes amid spiking gas and electricity prices, which are set to rise by double digits when rates are adjusted to reflect the results of a basic generation service auction held in February.
“This is a crisis in utility costs that makes it difficult for residents to manage household finances,” said bill sponsor Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester). “This program will alert homeowners and renters so they aren’t caught by surprise with exorbitant bills and are provided with real-time information so they can manage their energy consumption and better control costs.”
Lawmakers are holding joint hearings on spiking utility costs. The panel’s first hearing last month saw testimony from state energy regulators, energy experts, and PJM Interconnection, the state’s grid operator.
Democrats have increasingly sought to blame PJM for the price hikes, while Republicans have said the Murphy administration’s ambitious renewable energy goals and resistance to fossil fuel projects are a clearer cause.
The panel will hold a second hearing Friday.

It is used only when Missouri citizens feel that their elected officials aren’t listening and it has been used across the political spectrum.
It’s a tradition and a process rooted in fairness: when a majority of voters vote “yes” on a ballot measure, it passes.
That’s democracy.
That’s majority rule.
Now we see that politicians in Jefferson City are working on ways to change the rules to silence the voice of the citizens with the intent to diminish majority rule.
Lawmakers are pushing a deceptive proposal to end majority rule on ballot measures. SJR 47 would require a concurrent, actually a double majority, to win: a majority of the popular vote statewide plus a majority of Missouri House districts. This is an unnecessary hurdle that would be virtually impossible to overcome.
There is no other election that requires a concurrent majority vote. The irony is that these same politicians are elected by simple majority. In fact, if this bill passes, it needs only a simple majority of the legislature to put it on the ballot.
If this bill were to pass, it would mean that actually a small minority of voters—representing just a handful of legislative districts — could overrule the will of a statewide majority on every ballot measure in the future.
That means even if a majority of Missourians vote yes on a proposal, it could still fail. That’s not democracy. That is not fair. It would not be  “one person, one vote”. It would be a rigged system where some votes count more than others.
Politicians claim they’re trying to “protect” the Missouri Constitution from outside influence. But the current process is extremely difficult. It requires tens of thousands of signatures from citizens across the state and a majority vote by the people to pass. That’s not easy, and it shouldn’t be. But when a majority of Missourians vote to support a law, it should become law.
The politicians also say the process is overrun by special interests. That’s simply not true. The initiative petition process was designed to give regular Missourians, not lobbyists or partisan politicians, a voice in our democracy.
Over the years, it’s been used in a variety of ways: to expand access to health care, raise the minimum wage, create the nonpartisan court plan, and add a tax to support state parks and conservation, for example. These aren’t “special interests.”
These are the people of Missouri taking action when their lawmakers refuse to.
When a majority of Missourians voted yes to Medicaid expansion, fair elections, and reproductive freedom, lawmakers tried to block implementation or repeal the results. Last week, the Missouri Senate spent more than 10 hours debating a bill that would overturn the paid sick days law passed by over 57% of Missourians last November.
Now, they want to change the rules entirely—to make sure an initiative petition never happens again.
These are politicians who want to silence your voice. They want to stop you from having a say in the issues that impact your family, your future, and your freedom.
Do not let them.
The League of Women Voters of Missouri has defended democracy in this state for over a century. Our mission is to empower voters. We believe in majority rule. We believe in fairness in the election process.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Senate passed a bill to expand access to health care for postpartum mothers on Tuesday, while Assembly Republicans passed bills to further restrict and implement obstacles to accessing unemployment benefits for Wisconsinites.
The Senate for a second time since the last session passed a bill that would extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum mothers in Wisconsin from 60 days to a full year after childbirth. The measure received almost unanimous support, passing 32-1 with Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) casting the only ‘no’ vote. 
Bill author Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) said at a press conference that Wisconsin has a responsibility to support mothers and babies. 
Pregnant women in Wisconsin can currently receive Medicaid coverage if they have an annual income of up to 306% of the federal poverty level, however, they risk losing their coverage 60 days after giving birth. Newborns already receive a year of coverage in Wisconsin. 
The bill received an outpouring of support from members of the public during a bill hearing. This included, James noted, support from mothers who dealt with heart failure, preeclampsia and other health issues.  
“That’s why we’re here today,” James said. “Those moms are why we’re here today — their stories of life-threatening heart conditions, postpartum complications and the postpartum depression… Let’s give them the care they need.” 
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said it is morally and fiscally “the right thing to do” for Wisconsin. 
According to a fiscal estimate by the Department of Health Services, the policy would cost $18.5 million in all funds including $7.3 million in general purpose revenue. If Wisconsin joined other states that have accepted the full federal Medicaid expansion, the cost for the postpartum coverage would be reduced to $15.1 million in all funds including $5.2 million in general purpose revenue.
Wisconsin is one of only two states in the country that haven’t opted to expand Medicaid coverage for postpartum moms, and despite bipartisan support, because of opposition from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), the bill continues to face challenges in becoming law. 
“Why is Wisconsin fighting for last place?” Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) asked during floor debate.
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he was glad that the proposal was being voted on again, but also said it is “odd” that lawmakers were speaking about extending the benefit in a national political environment where the federal Medicaid program as a whole is under threat.
“I would hope that we could take that initial step beyond [this bill] …  to do our best to ensure that Medicaid overall is protected,” Larson said. “If the feds decide to set fire to Medicaid, as has been happening with other areas of government, there is no way that other states can make up for it.” 
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) noted on the floor that the Senate also passed the bill last session 32-1, and the Assembly is the reason that it was unsuccessful. 
Assembly Speaker Vos was one of the major obstacles to the advancement of the bill in the Assembly last session, and he continues to oppose the bill, having termed it an expansion of “welfare.”
“[Assembly Republicans] sat on it and did nothing and since that time, women and babies have been hurt because they haven’t received the care that they need,” Hesselbein said. “I’m very hopeful after our action again today that we could talk to the Republicans in the state Assembly and get this done.”
Felzkowski told lawmakers to remember that it can take more than one legislative session for a bill to pass and expressed confidence that the Assembly will eventually come around. 
“Sometimes it takes two or three [sessions], sometimes it takes four. We’ll get the Assembly there,” Felzkowski said during the floor session. “I promise.” 
When asked about the bill during a press conference Tuesday, Vos didn’t commit to bringing it up for a vote, saying that his caucus hasn’t discussed it yet, but he said he hasn’t changed his own position.
“My position has been fairly clear from the very beginning. I’ve never supported an expansion of welfare. I can’t imagine that I would ever support one,” Vos said. “But we have to talk about it as a caucus.”
Over 70% of the Assembly are co-sponsors on the bill, including 28 Republicans — who represent over half of the Assembly Republican caucus — and 44 Democrats. It needs a simple majority of 50 votes to pass.
New restrictions, requirements on unemployment insurance 
While the Senate sought to expand the public health care benefits for Wisconsin mothers, Assembly Republicans took action to restrict benefits for Wisconsinites who lose their jobs, passing a slate of bills that would restrict and implement more obstacles to receiving unemployment insurance.
People in Wisconsin are eligible to receive unemployment insurance if they were laid off and must be able, available and actively looking for work and willing to accept suitable work. The state Department of Workforce Development determines the weekly benefit. In Wisconsin, the minimum weekly benefit in Wisconsin is $54 while the maximum benefit is $370 per week.
Vos said the bills ensure that “all the folks who are in Wisconsin, who are able-bodied” and “living off the system wrongly” are “doing their due diligence to find a job as opposed to living off the system.”
  “I’ve never supported an expansion of welfare. I can’t imagine that I would ever support one,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said about the postpartum Medicaid bill. “But we have to talk about it as a caucus.” (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
Democratic lawmakers slammed the bills, saying they were wrongly seeking to make it more difficult to access public benefits at a time when Wisconsinites may need them more than ever given recent upheaval in the federal government under the Trump administration. 
“While Trump is starting trade wars, pushing the economy off the ledge and laying off droves of federal workers, legislative Republicans are doing nothing to push back,” Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said. “In fact, they’ve decided that the best use of our time here today on the floor is to make it harder for Wisconsinites to receive their earned benefits in a very chaotic time.”
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), speaking against the bills lawmakers were taking up, said it appeared to be “kick folks while they’re down day” in the Assembly. He said unemployment insurance is a “Wisconsin idea” — noting that Wisconsin was the first state in the country to establish an Unemployment Compensation program — and that the program provides protections for businesses and employees.
“Employers pay into UI and their employees get access to unemployment insurance by working for them, and when someone is laid off or a deeply unfunny billionaire with a chainsaw fires them or a business goes out of business because of deeply unfunny tariffs then the employee… gets a little bit back to help them survive until they get another” job, Clancy said.  
Republican lawmakers defended the bills as making the unemployment programs better for employers and those seeking the benefits. 
One bill — AB 164 — would change Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance program by renaming it the “reemployment assistance” program and expanding requirements for receiving the help. It would also require claimants make “direct” contact with potential employers as a part of their four required work searches weekly — or risk their benefits. The bill passed 53-42.
Rep. Benjamin Franklin said the bill requirements are “not a burden.” 
“It is an opportunity,” Rep. Ben Franklin (R-De Pere) said during floor debate. “Making real connections with hiring managers increases the odds of finding work that aligns with one’s experience, goals and skills.”
Vos said the proposals are “common sense” and accused Democrats of trying to keep people out of work.
“There are people all over the state of Wisconsin who are lying to us, lying to themselves and getting the benefit of the resources that the state of Wisconsin have when there is a job ready and waiting for them to take it,” Vos said. “Why would you want to support people who are scamming a system?”
Lawmakers also passed AB 165, which would ban local governments from using tax money to create guaranteed income programs without a work or training requirement, in a 53-42 party-line vote.
A handful of Wisconsin cities have explored pilot guaranteed income programs, including Madison, Milwaukee and Wausau. Clancy said people benefiting from local guaranteed income programs were being misrepresented by Republicans. 
“Giving cash to people in poverty helps them not to be in poverty,” Clancy said. “As it turns out, most people already know what they need and they make remarkably astute decisions about how to spend these benefits to help themselves and their families by meeting their most urgent needs.” 
Clancy said that in Milwaukee some beneficiaries have used the program to help pay rent, buy a vehicle to help them get to work and to take time off in preparation for the birth of a baby.
AB 167, which would expand the definition of employee misconduct used to deny an unemployment insurance claim and a worker’s compensation claim, passed 53-42.
Under the bill the definition of misconduct would include the unauthorized possession of an employer’s property or theft, unauthorized distribution of an employer’s confidential information, use of an employer’s credit card or other financial instrument for an unauthorized purpose and the violation of a company’s social media policy or absenteeism policy. The bill would also require the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) to conduct random audits of half of the work searches reported by people claiming unemployment benefits. 
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha), speaking against the bill, said Republicans will have to “wake up to the reality that there is chaos and confusion in Washington D.C.” at some point. 
“It will hurt working families in Wisconsin and… one of the things that they’re going to need if a recession comes and they are out of work and they are laid off are these unemployment benefits,” McGuire said. “Making it easier to restrict them from those benefits is bad. It’s bad for our economy. It’s bad for our working families. It’s bad for the people of the state.” 
Bill author Rep. Duke Tucker (R-Grantsburg) said that everyone should “strive for efficient and effective government programs” and said the bill would help ensure the unemployment insurance program is “healthy.” 
“Unemployment insurance is for those who lost their job through no fault of their own. What better way can we ensure the possibility of increased benefits [than] by having a solvent fund that’s well managed?” Tucker asked. He added there is no “ill intent” with the bill. 
Evers has previously vetoed bills similar to the unemployment changes and the guaranteed income ban.
Other related bills passed by the Assembly include:

AB 162 would require state agencies to compile metrics on training and workforce development programs, including the unemployment rates and median earnings of participants six months after they graduate from a program. It passed 53-42.
AB 168 would allow felony fraud claims related to unemployment to be prosecuted up to eight years after a crime was committed, extending the current statute of limitations of six years. It would also require the DWD to provide information about unemployment — including providing training materials for employers and claimants and expanding its call center hours — and to implement “identity-proofing” measures for unemployment. The bill passed 53-42.
AB 169 would allow an employer to report to DWD an unemployment recipient who  declines or fails to show up to a job interview or declines a job offer. This would be used to determine benefits. The bill passed 53-42.

(Image by Niseri N/Getty Images)Oklahoma’s students are about to be handed a set of deeply politicized social studies standards, and what’s happening here is a warning for the rest of the country. 
But the real danger isn’t any single lie, it’s the system Superintendent Ryan Walters has created while imposing them. He has methodically silenced dissent by slashing the time for public comment from three minutes to one. He’s attempted to bury his policy changes from public scrutiny through efforts to change how the State Department of Education responds to open records requests. And we’ve seen him threaten to strong-arm “rogue” school leaders into compliance with other policies while spreading misinformation. 
This is how propaganda replaces truth.
Walters has celebrated creating these standards with the help of right-wing pundits. But despite being so proud of them, Walters apparently had to trick the State Board of Education into approving them. Board members have said that Walters neglected to mention to them that he’d made last-minute changes, and that there were two different versions of the standards — the one available to the public online and the other included in a packet put together for the governing board. 
In fact, my analysis of the public draft versus the one sent to lawmakers found the State Department of Education made more than 70 secret changes after public comment closed. Among those changes are claims that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab and that the 2020 presidential election involved interference. Both are unproven and highly politicized assertions that would now be presented as fact to Oklahoma’s students.
If these standards are so laudable why are education leaders afraid to give these the public vetting and discussion they deserve?
Walters quietly embedded these narratives over a month ago, and now we are watching as similar language begins surfacing at the federal level. This past weekend, the federal government quietly altered its official COVID-19 web pages to reflect the same lab-leak framing promoted in Oklahoma’s proposed standards. It signals how President Donald Trump and his allies intend to reshape public memory and our classrooms in coordinated, strategic ways.
What Walters is doing here is not just about Oklahoma. It is part of a larger, carefully timed campaign. If these standards pass, it will not stop here. 
The Oklahoma Legislature has until May 1 to consider them. They could accept, reject, alter them or do nothing, which would result in them passing as written. Some State Board of Education members are calling on lawmakers to return the standards to them for further review. 
So far, Republican legislative leaders have not been willing to take a stand.
But it won’t be long before Oklahomans learn if their elected officials can tell the difference between truth and propaganda.
For all our sakes, I hope they can because our children deserve nothing less than the accurate, unvarnished truth.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)An Idaho judge has ordered Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador be deposed in a whistleblower lawsuit brought by a former AG office attorney.
Idaho 4th District Judge Jonathan Medema on April 17 partially rejected the Office of the Attorney General’s motion for a protective order that would’ve prevented Labrador from answering questions by former Deputy Attorney General Daphne Huang’s attorneys in her lawsuit.
In September 2023, Huang, who previously represented the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, sued Labrador’s office after she was fired, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. She alleged the Idaho attorney general’s office retaliated against her after she raised ethical concerns related to her clients’ legal representation. 
The judge limited Labrador’s in-person deposition to last up to two hours. 
“I have evidence in the deposition testimony … that Attorney General Labrador was the person in the office who made the decision to terminate Ms. Huang’s employment. What he knew and why he chose to make that (decision) … is important information for the plaintiff’s claims,” Medema said in an April 14 court hearing. 
The judge, in a separate ruling, also sanctioned the Idaho Attorney General’s Office for Labrador’s failure to appear for his previously scheduled deposition. Hours after the deposition was set to occur, the Attorney General’s Office filed a motion for a protective order that sought to stop Labrador from being deposed. 
The judge required the office to pay expenses, including attorney fees, related to Labrador’s deposition. He also required the Attorney General’s Office to pay plaintiff’s expenses, including attorney fees, associated with their motion for sanctions.
“If Defendant wanted to file a motion seeking a protective order, it was incumbent upon Defendant to at least file that motion before February 14, at 9 a.m.,” when Labrador’s deposition was originally scheduled, Medema wrote in his decision released April 17.
The Idaho Office of the Attorney General could not be immediately reached for comment.
In a statement, Guy Hallam, an attorney for Huang, said “No one is above the law, including the Idaho Attorney General.”
“Ms. Huang applauds the Court’s decision to allow Mr. Labrador’s deposition to move forward and appreciates the Court’s grant of sanctions against the Office of Attorney General after Mr. Labrador failed to show up for his previously scheduled deposition,” Hallam wrote. “No one is above the law, including the Idaho Attorney General.”

 Lawsuit ties back to Labrador’s child care grants investigation into Department of Health and Welfare

Huang’s lawsuit ties back to an investigation the Idaho Attorney General’s Office launched in early 2023 into how $72 million in child care grants were distributed by the Department of Health and Welfare. 
In August 2023, a state audit found issues in the grant distribution and spending, despite two legal memos Huang wrote to Health and Welfare that found the agency’s administration of the grant funds was legally sound. Labrador’s office had withdrawn the legal advice.
Months later, the critical state audit spurred reform efforts in Health and Welfare, despite former agency leadership’s initial response to refute all of the audit’s findings.  
Since March 2024, when two lawsuits by organizations that received the funds concluded, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office has not issued public updates about its investigation. Lawsuits surrounding the investigation were the main avenue for updates. 
In December 2023, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office’s special prosecutor in the investigation, Christopher Boyd, claimed in a legal filing that he found probable cause that the agency’s then-grant manager had committed a crime.
The prosecutor did not cite evidence for the claim, or cite a specific crime. More than a year later, no criminal charges have been filed against the former agency employee, Idaho court records show.
In August 2023, Labrador appointed Boyd, who is now Canyon County’s prosecuting attorney, as a special prosecutor in the investigation. 
His appointment followed a separate Idaho judge’s ruling that barred Labrador from pursuing what are essentially subpoenas in civil court in the case. The court order found a conflict of interest since the Attorney General’s Office previously provided legal advice on the grants to Health and Welfare. 
But the ruling still allowed Labrador to oversee the grants investigation. Boyd later said he’d withdraw the civil investigative demands to conserve resources, saying a state audit answered questions that the demands sought to answer. 
 Huang filed a complaint against Labrador with the Idaho State Bar. The former Health and Welfare director did, too.

Attorney General Labrador under ethics investigation by Idaho State Bar after complaint

In August 2024, former Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen disclosed to the Idaho Capital Sun he had filed an ethics complaint against Labrador with the Idaho State Bar in June 2023.
Court records in Huang’s lawsuit show Labrador was subject to another complaint — by Huang — with Idaho’s attorney licensing association. 
Hallam, an attorney for Huang, confirmed to the Sun that Huang had filed a bar complaint against Labrador, but did not share the complaint itself.
In a February ruling, Judge Medema writes that Yvonne Dunbar, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office fair hearings division chief and state general counsel, “was asked if the Office of the Attorney General was made aware that Ms. Huang had filed a bar complaint against Mr. Labrador.”
The judge overruled Dunbar’s objection to that question, which was on the grounds of attorney-client privilege. He granted a motion to compel on the question, asked by Huang’s attorneys in deposition.

“She was not asked how the office came to learn that information, if it did,” Medema wrote in his ruling. “She was not even asked how she knows the answer. She was simply asked if the Office was aware of its filing.”
In that ruling, the judge rejected a host of other objections in Dunbar’s deposition attempted by the Idaho Office of the Attorney General.
Huang’s lawsuit is scheduled to go to a jury trial in October.

The complaint is the latest development in an ongoing dispute over how or to what extent the state should govern political parties.

Newly elected leaders for the Hot Springs County GOP are asking a district court judge “to prevent the Wyoming Republican Party from interfering in local county Republican Party elections,” a lawsuit filed Monday states. 
The case comes after Brian Shuck, an attorney for the state GOP, advised several county parties in March to disregard state statute and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling and allow ousted committee precinct people to vote in local party elections. 
Hot Springs County GOP instead stuck to the law and the high court’s decision when it held officer elections last month, according to the complaint. That choice set off a series of events — including a closed-door meeting where participants were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements — and ultimately led the state GOP to order the county party to overturn its election results. 
Now, Hot Springs County GOP leadership is asking a court to intervene. 
“If the Wyoming Republican Party is allowed to overturn local county party elections through secret tribunals, it will have become a self-perpetuating, Soviet-style politburo rather than a functioning political party in a representative democracy,” the lawsuit states. 
The Wyoming Republican Party stood by its position in a press release posted to its Facebook page Wednesday morning. 
“Just as President Trump has been targeted by lawfare and liberal lawyers, the Wyoming GOP has been as well. This case is just another example,” the party wrote in the post.

The complaint raises questions about what will happen in May when Republicans gather in Cody to elect state party leadership, and is the latest development in a lengthy dispute over the extent the state should govern political parties since they are private organizations. 
The plaintiffs include Joe Martinez, Phillip Scheel, Meri Ann Dorman and Clay Van Antwerp. The four of them were elected chairman, state committeeman, secretary and vice chair, respectively. They are represented by Clark Stith, a former Sweetwater County lawmaker. Stith is also the attorney for the two legislators who are currently suing the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — the further-right wing of the Legislature’s Republican rule — for defamation related to mailers in last year’s elections. 
How we got here
When the Hot Springs County GOP held its officer elections on March 17, the contest for chairman initially ended in a seven-to-seven vote, according to the lawsuit. The tie was broken through a random drawing.
“Names were placed in a hat and a child that was present drew out a name,” the lawsuit states. “The name read was Joe Martinez.”
Elected in August as a county precinct person, Martinez ran for chairman against Bradyn Harvey, who lost his own precinct bid in the primary election. 
With Martinez selected as the new chairman, he presided over the rest of the meeting. Soon, there was another tie vote between Harvey and Clay Van Antwerp — this time for the vice chair. Once again, names were placed in a cap and another child drew another name — Van Antwerp. 
The race for secretary resulted in another tie settled by drawing lots. It went to Meri Ann Dorman. Meanwhile, Phillip Scheel outright won state committeeman in an 8-6 vote. 
The trouble started after the meeting was adjourned, according to the lawsuit. 
Harvey and Mary Jager, both ousted precinct people, presented Martinez and Dorman with papers labeled “provisional ballots.” Had those ballots been counted, the races for chairman and state committeeman would have flipped. 
But neither the bylaws for the county party nor the state party “have any provisions relating to the casting of provisional ballots,” according to the lawsuit. As such, the ballots were not counted. 
Some time after the meeting, Cheryl Aguiar filed a complaint with the state party. Aguiar is former chairman of the Hot Springs County GOP. 
Alongside others who lost their races, Aguiar disputed the validity of the county party’s elections and asked that the “provisional ballots” be counted. Aguiar submitted her complaint to the state party’s Dispute Resolution Committee. 
From there, Martinez, Scheel, Dorman and Van Antwerp were asked to sign confidentiality agreements in a March 20 letter from Kathy Russell, executive director of the Wyoming Republican Party.

If they did not sign such agreements, the letter stated, they would not be allowed to participate in the dispute resolution process. The plaintiffs did so, according to the lawsuit, but were ultimately left out of the April 8 meeting where the committee sided with Aguiar. 
“The Dispute Resolution Committee then ordered the Hot Springs County Republican Party to conduct a recount of the March 17, 2025 ballots and include the provisional ballots in the recount and that the results be entered into the minutes of the meeting as the final election results, and that such results then be submitted to the Hot Springs County Clerk and to the Executive Director of the Wyoming Republican Party,” the lawsuit alleges. 
The meeting was chaired by Park County GOP Chairman Vince Vanata, who declined to comment to WyoFile. Other committee members included  Ann Slagle of Weston County, Carla Klopfenstein of Sheridan County, Scott Petty of Carbon County, Scott Brown of Big Horn County and Katherine Rueckert of Teton County.  
Complaint
Shuck’s advice to follow a party bylaw and allow ousted precinct committee members to vote was centered on the fact that the matter involves a private organization. 
That idea was also at the heart of a 2021 case in Uinta County. In that case, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled two years ago that the bylaw “violated clear and unambiguous language,” of state law. Because the high court did not decide on whether the state law violated the party’s constitutional right to freedom of association, Shuck told county parties the bylaw — and ultimately, the U.S. Constitution — supplants state statute. 
The complaint filed Monday challenges Shuck’s reasoning. 
“If the [Wyoming Republican Party] were the Rotary Club or Elks Lodge, then the foregoing bylaw provisions, however eccentric they might be, could be valid and enforceable under certain circumstances,” the lawsuit states. “But the defendant is not a Rotary Club or an Elks Lodge.”
Instead, the Wyoming Republican Party has been given powers “exclusively reserved to the state, namely a key role in running elections and filling vacancies of Wyoming public officials,” the complaint states.
As such, the plaintiffs argue, political parties are “state actors” and are asking the court to issue a judgment that they were duly elected in March. The plaintiffs are also challenging the party’s dispute resolution process and are asking the court to void the committee’s order to overturn the elections. 
The complaint was filed in Laramie County District Court, where the state party is headquartered.

""Bringing the buffalo back is about our relationship with them, not domination over them,"" said Jason Baldes, executive director of the Wind River Buffalo Initiative.
The post Why the Eastern Shoshone decided to classify buffalo as wildlife appeared first on WyoFile .","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

Jason Baldes drove down a dusty, sagebrush highway earlier this month, pulling 11 young buffalo in a trailer up from Colorado to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. His blue truck has painted on the side a drawing of buffalo and a calf. As the executive director of the Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative and an Eastern Shoshone tribal member, he’s helped grow the number of buffalo on the reservation for the last decade. The latest count: the Northern Arapaho tribe has 97 and the Eastern Shoshone has 118. 
“Tribes have an important role in restoring buffalo for food sovereignty, culture and nutrition, but also for overall bison recovery,” he said.
The Eastern Shoshone this month voted to classify buffalo as wildlife instead of livestock as a way to treat them more like elk or deer rather than like cattle. Because the two tribes share the same land base, the Northern Arapaho are expected to vote on the distinction as well. The vote indicates a growing interest to both restore buffalo on the landscape and challenge the relationship between animal and product. 
While climate change isn’t the main driver behind the push to restore buffalo’s wildlife status, the move could bring positive effects to the fight against global warming. Climate change is shrinking Wyoming’s glaciers, contributing to drought and increasing wildfires. Like cows, buffalo emit methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, by belching, though it’s not clear if buffalo give off the same levels.
While buffalo can contribute to climate change, what they bring in increased biodiversity can promote drought resistance and some buffalo herds have been shown to help store carbon. 
The scale of cattle on the landscape and how they are managed contribute to climate change. Baldes argues buffalo should be able to roam on the plains to bolster biodiversity and restore the ecological health of the landscape — but that has to come with a change in relationship. 
“Buffalo as wildlife allows the animals to exist on the landscape,” Baldes said. “Rather than livestock based on economic and Western paradigms.”

Wildlife is broadly defined as all living organisms, like plants and animals, that exist outside the direct control of humans. When it comes to how different states define wildlife, the definition can vary. But a good rule of thumb is animals that are not domesticated — as in selectively bred for human consumption or companionship — are typically classified as wildlife. 
“Bison have a complex history since their near extinction over 100 years ago,” said Lisa Shipley, a professor at Washington State University who studies management of wild ungulates, which are large mammals with hooves that include buffalo. Tribes and locals tend to say buffalo while scientists use bison to describe the animal.
During the western expansion of settlers, a combination of overhunting, habitat destruction and government policy aimed at killing Indigenous peoples’ food supplies eradicated the animal from the landscape. 
Around eight million buffalo were in the United States in 1870 and then in the span of 20 years, there were fewer than 500. Today, in North America, there are roughly 20,000 wild plains bison — like the ones Baldes works to put on the Wind River. But most buffalo reside in privately owned operations, where many buffalo are raised for the growing bison meat industry. In 2023, around 85,000 bison were processed for meat consumption in the United States, compared to the 36 million head of cattle. It’s not a lot compared to cattle, but some producers see buffalo as an interesting new addition to the global meat market. 
The numbers are similar for other kinds of wildlife — there are typically more livestock on the land than wildlife. According to one study, if all the livestock of the world were weighed, the livestock would be 30 times heavier than the weight of all the wildlife on Earth.
Reducing the world’s collective reliance on cows — a popular variety of livestock — has been a way many see as a path forward to combating climate change. Eating less beef and dairy products can be good for the planet; cows account for around 10% of greenhouse gas emissions.  And having too many cows on a small patch of pasture can negatively affect the environment by causing soil erosion and affecting the amount of carbon the land can absorb.

The Wind River Range towers behind, potential habitat for a herd that tribal members hope will someday roam wild and restore lost elements of cultural identity, diet and ceremony. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
Buffalo tend to move around if given enough room to roam. One study saw that cattle spent half their time grazing, while buffalo only around a quarter of the time — buffalo even moved faster and had an affinity for more varieties of grasses to munch on. But even buffalo can damage the landscape if they are managed like cattle.
“Too many animals on the landscape can lead to rangeland degradation and health concerns,” said Justin Binfet, wildlife management coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. The state has classified buffalo as both livestock and wildlife, which means they can be privately owned or managed in conservation herds. However, different places in the state have different rules regarding the animal. Currently, Wyoming issues around 70 buffalo hunting tags a year. 
The National Park Service manages the oldest untouched population of buffalo in Yellowstone National Park, which intersects with both Wyoming and Montana. Montana has sued the Park Service over their buffalo management plan, citing potential negative effects as the park grows the herd and an interest in letting the buffalo push the boundaries in the park like other wildlife do. The Montana Stockgrowers Association — a group that advocates for the sale of beef — said the Yellowstone management plan for buffalo “did not adequately represent all management options that should be considered,” like more population control and increased tribal hunting.
Ranchers in Wyoming and Montana, including tribal members who raise cattle, often cite the disease brucellosis as a reason to keep buffalo and cattle strictly away from each other. The management plan for buffalo says that there has not been a recorded case of bison-to-cattle transmission. 
Wyoming has a history of contesting tribal hunting rights. In the 2019 United States Supreme Court Case Herrera v. Wyoming, the court ruled in favor of treaty-protected hunting rights within the state. But how this history will intersect with buffalo’s classification as wildlife remains to be seen. 
On the Wind River Reservation, the tribes have control of wildlife management and hunting regulations. The choice to designate buffalo as wildlife is a matter of tribal sovereignty, tribes making decisions on their homelands.
For Baldes, he wants to eventually hunt buffalo like someone would any other wildlife. He’s in the process of buying property to allow buffalo to roam like they did before Western expansion. He doesn’t like it when people call the Wind River Buffalo Initiative a “ranch,” because it has too much of an association with cows and cattle. He says buffalo should be treated like they were before settler contact. 
“Bringing the buffalo back is about our relationship with them, not domination over them,” Baldes said.

Protesting might feel good, but recruiting new voters is the real work of democracy, guest columnist Rod Miller pleads.
The post To protest or vote? Pick the right tool for the job. appeared first on WyoFile .","I have nothing against political protests. They are a great American tradition, enshrined in the First Amendment.

Opinion

Filling the streets with like-minded folks, shouting slogans and carrying signs is great political theater. It draws a crowd and creates headlines in a brief news cycle. It encourages community, and signals the virtue of one ideology or another. But it doesn’t move the needle.
While a political protest might provide some emotional catharsis, and let off some steam, it won’t change things. It emphasizes symbolism over substance.
Think about it for a moment. All the folks that you see protesting on sidewalks in front of the capitol in Cheyenne, or in parks around the nation, are there for one reason only — they got outvoted in the last election. They are protesting because Trump won, or the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won, and those election victories have put a burr under their collective saddle.
I think protesters have lost sight of the fact that elections are not won by counting the number of people in the street, but by counting votes. Some 10,000 people rallying and toting signs won’t change a single vote in the last election. Protesters don’t realize that their real job is to win the next election by using the ballot to seize the reins of political power.
If they can do the grunt work of democracy, and win the next election, then they’ll instead force their political opponents to march around carrying signs and whining about losing political power. That sounds pretty satisfying to me.
Let’s look at some numbers.
In the last election, despite claims of a record voter turnout, roughly 40% of voting-eligible Wyomingites didn’t even bother to register. That represents around 150,000 votes that were never cast, a number large enough to swing any election in the Cowboy State. The same ratio holds for the national election as well, and is roughly consistent across gender and racial demographics.
We personally know these people who don’t participate in our elections. They are our family, friends, neighbors, the guy on the next barstool and the woman in the checkout line at the grocery store. They share our “blessings of liberty,” but do nothing to help secure it. To put it harshly, they are the dead weight of democracy.
And there are enough of them to truly change things.
I would argue that convincing these folks to register and vote is much more important than standing around with a protest sign, and screaming outrage into the wind. And that, friends and neighbors, is the only thing that will truly move the needle.
We will get better results by putting down our signs and getting our hands dirty by dialing phones and knocking on doors to reach these non-voters. We might ask ourselves, if I protest with one hand, and organize with the other, which hand will get the best results?
So I challenge all the “Hands Off” or “No Kings” protesters to spend 10 hours recruiting new voters for every hour they spend protesting. The work will be harder and more frustrating than attending a rally, but it’s the right tool for the job.
Don’t rely on anyone else to do this task, it’s up to us as citizens. The political parties won’t do it. The government won’t do it. It must be done citizen to citizen, neighbor to neighbor. It’s simply too important a chore to leave to anyone else.
Based on my personal experience, you’ll encounter a lot of excuses from the unregistered when you try to convince them to carry their weight. You’ll hear stuff like, “There’s too much dark money in politics,” or “The Freedom Caucus is making it too hard to vote,” or “The Russians manipulate our elections,” or “My voice won’t matter anyway.”
Horseshit! That is nothing more than a weak cop-out. Citizens should be prepared to crawl on their bellies over broken whiskey bottles to exercise the right to vote.
We enjoy the right to self-government through voting because 56 patriots signed the Declaration of Independence, providing us that opportunity. The last sentence before these 56 signatures reads, “And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”
Compared to our Founders’ commitment of their lives, fortunes and honor, shirking one’s responsibility to vote seems to be a piss-ant move, to me. And protesting just because your side gets out-voted is simply choosing the wrong tool for the job.

Mike Braun for final approval. (Getty Images)House Republicans gave the final go-ahead Tuesday to a caucus priority bill that seeks to incentivize new power generation in Indiana.
A 63-23 party-line vote on House Bill 1007 set the measure on course for Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
The bill will expedite approval processes for large-load customers like data centers and create cost recovery mechanisms for projects utilities take on to serve those big customers. 
It will also require a big prospective grid addition to make “significant and meaningful financial assurances” for such projects — reimbursing at least 80% of costs and protecting other existing and future customers from the expenses.
The bill, authored by Rep. Ed Soliday, Valparaiso, additionally gets tough with utilities planning to close — or convert to natural gas — any coal-fired plants of at least 125 megawatts. Current law mandates utilities that are not generating at least 85% of peak demand to report three-year projections to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).
House, Senate push along bills to attract nuclear developments to Indiana

Utilities will instead be required to annually report the amount of resource generating capacity they plan to take offline. If, after an investigation, the IURC doesn’t think a utility can provide reliable service, it would have to block the utility’s plan or order it to either acquire or build capacity.
“We’re in competition with other states,” Soliday said. “We will not be the biggest incentive-offering state. (The bill) will put us in second. We won’t get a dime if they don’t come here, but if we are able to incentivize them to come here, we get 80% of something, not 100% of nothing.”
After strong pushback, senators removed more contentious provisions that intended to specifically boost small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) development — including a 20% sales tax credit for utilities. 
That tax credit remains in the bill, however, for Hoosier manufacturers that produce SMR technology which could later be used by utilities in Indiana or elsewhere across the globe.
Democratic Rep. Matt Pierce, of Bloomington, said Tuesday he has concerns about the remaining tax credit, which could cost taxpayers an estimated $280 million, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.  
He worried, too, that the overall bill will “force more expensive, obsolete coal plants to remain online for a longer period of time” — given that SMR development has largely been proposed on existing coal plant sites.
“Imagine what we could do with $280 million when it comes to providing people with health care, childcare, other essential services that people may rely upon the state,” Pierce said.

The sheer lawlessness of Trump’s campaign of terror against immigrants is breathtaking. 
On University of Wisconsin campuses, hundreds of international students who had their visas canceled are scrambling. Some are giving up their studies and going home, even though they’ve done nothing wrong and could probably get their visas reinstated through an appeals process. They don’t want to take their chances with this capricious, menacing administration. 
Who can blame them? Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia was dragged from his car and sent to El Salvador due to an “administrative error” — yet the administration still refuses to return him. Sloppy police work and a cavalier attitude toward the law also appear to have landed a Milwaukee beautician with tattoos that had nothing to do with gangs in the same Salvadoran “terrorist” detention center. 
Recently, Wisconsin Public Radio reported that Neenah resident Tom Frantz, a retired college administrator who was born in the U.S., received notifications from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security telling him to leave the country immediately. The letters warned him, “Do not attempt to remain in the United States — the federal government will find you.” Frantz turned to Sen. Tammy Baldwin to help clear up what seems to be a mistake. It’s a bad sign that Franz, with no immigration background at all, felt he had to take the threat seriously.
High-profile black ops against student protesters, a White House visit from the self-described dictator of El Salvador, who thumbed his nose at the U.S. Supreme Court while sitting in the Oval Office, refusing to return the wrongly deported Abrego Garcia, Trump officials mocking due process and flouting the law — all of this is designed to foster fear, hopelessness and despair.

Grant Sovern, an immigration attorney in Madison who helped found the Community Immigration Law Center, is standing up to all of that.
He and his colleagues have been raising money through small donations at house parties to sustain a public defender service for immigrants in Dane County who face the threat of deportation. 
“Not everyone is actually deportable who ICE thinks is deportable,” Sovern says. “Maybe ICE has it wrong. … People don’t know. You need an advocate who knows the rules.”
That’s where the Community Immigration Law Center (CILC) comes in. The group’s mission is to ensure that everyone in Dane County who needs an immigration attorney gets one. It’s a significant step toward upholding the rule of law generally. 
Sovern points to an evaluation of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, the nation’s first public defender service for immigrants facing deportation. The project provided lawyers to all low-income immigrants facing deportation proceedings in New York City. Before the project, only 4% of those challenging deportation were successful. Once they were provided with attorneys, the rate of success rose to 48%.
“So half of the people who were being deported shouldn’t be,” Sovern says. “It’s not like these lawyers were getting around the law. They were applying the rules.”
And even under the current administration, applying the rules makes a difference. “At this moment, when everyone feels so hopeless,” Sovern says, CILC is demonstrating that “we can do something.” 
Some of the nonprofit law firm’s clients have been going through immigration court proceedings for years, starting in the first Trump administration. Others are new clients who are challenging deportation orders and winning.
The U.S. Supreme Court has responded cautiously to the Trump administration’s overreach as it deports people without due process. So far it has applied the brakes on Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act only by insisting that deportees’ cases be heard in the courts where they are located. 
For people Trump is targeting with its novel use of that wartime law, “the only due process you have is this habeas corpus petition,” explains Sovern — a petition demanding that the government bring people it has detained before a court and justify their detention.
Sovern knows one of the lawyers who wrote the habeas petition for Rumeysa Ozturk, the Tufts University graduate student who was snatched off the street in Boston by masked federal agents and spirited away to a Louisiana detention center. Ozturk’s lawyers filed a petition on her behalf in Massachusetts within five hours, Sovern says, but it was too late. Neither her attorneys nor her friends and family knew where she was and she was unable to speak to her lawyers until after she was flown out of state.
Last week, a federal judge in Vermont, a state Ozturk traveled through as government agents were taking her to Louisiana, ruled that she must be returned to New England no later than May 1 to determine whether she was illegally detained for co-writing an op-ed piece in her student newspaper supporting Palestinian victims of the war in Gaza.
“It is really dramatic how much it takes,” Sovern says of the struggle against Trump’s war on immigrants, due process and civil liberties. But he and his colleagues are rising to the challenge.
CILC’s goal is to be prepared for anything. “As long as we have some process, we are going to make that available,” Sovern says. “It’s going to cost a lot, and we’ll need expert lawyers to do it. But we’re going to find a way. If the Supreme Court and court system give people any type of due process at all, we have to be ready.”
See CILC’s website for more information about the group’s work and what you can do to help.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
LINCOLN — A decision on the preferred route for a recreation trail across Cass County is going extra innings.
The Cass County Board, which had initially intended to take up the controversial route decision at its meeting on Tuesday, has now delayed that discussion to its next meeting, on May 6, at the courthouse in Plattsmouth.
The Cass County trail would realize a long-time dream of establishing a contiguous hike-bike trail from Omaha to Lincoln. Trails now end in Cass County at the unincorporated village of Wabash and just south of the Platte River near a bridge across the river at South Bend. It leaves about an eight-mile gap.
A several months-long routing study done on behalf of the Lower Platte Natural Resources District had recommended a route that roughly follows 334th Street, a little-traveled, north-south, gravel road. And the Cass County Board had voted 3-2 to OK that route on Nov. 5.
But county commissioners, including two new board members elected later in November, reversed course last month, voting 4-1 to reconsider the earlier decision, and reopen talks with the NRD about the best route.
Cass County Board member Dan Stohlmann, who was elected in November, said Tuesday that all four routes initially considered are being revisited.
“There’s issues with each of them,” Stohlmann said.
Both he and fellow board member, Alex DeGarmo, told the Nebraska Examiner they remain optimistic that a route can be worked out.
While Cass County is not contributing financially to the project, its right of way — along gravel roads — would be used to build a connector, so it has a big say on the route. The existing trails used abandoned railroad right of way, while the connector would be built in road ditches, requiring stabilizing walls and drainage pipes.
The latest flap over a connector trail across Cass County follows a similar spat in 2009. That’s when a proposed route for the trail was shot down by landowners who objected to a trail crossing in front of their homes.
The current proposal got a boost in 2022 when the Nebraska Legislature allocated $8.3 million toward building the connector trail. The route chosen most recently, however, has an estimated price tag of more than $15 million.
Advocates for the trail maintain that the $15 million estimate is highly inflated and that actual construction costs could be reduced and that private donations would cover any gap.
Detractors of the trail express worries about safety around farm equipment and doubt that the trail would bring increased economic activity to Cass County.

Robert Behning talks about his reading bill on April 22, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Exceptions to the state’s new third grade retention law and tweaks to high school career fair requirements were baked into the final draft of a bill that’s now en route to the governor’s desk.
House Bill 1499, a follow-up to last year’s literacy overhaul law that requires reading-deficient third graders to be held back a year in school, earned unanimous approval from the House chamber on Tuesday.
Current statute requires that — if after three attempts — a third grade student is unable to pass the IREAD assessment, they must be held back a year in school.
This year’s bill, once signed into law, will give students at least two chances to retake the exam over the summer to avoid retention. In 2024, roughly 10,500 Hoosier third graders were still unable to pass the IREAD after retaking the exam once over the summer, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.
It also allows schools whose third grade student population is comprised of at least 50% English language learners to register those students with the Indiana Department of Education for an exemption from the retention requirement until until the beginning of the 2027-2028 academic year if they are unable to pass the IREAD.
The exemption would apply to an estimated 797 third grade English language learner students annually across 38 Indiana public schools.
The proposal, authored by Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, additionally permits career fairs to be held off of school property — as long as the school provides transportation. Current state law requires high schools to hold an annual career fair for 11th and 12th grade students.
Another piece of the bill reduces minimum work requirements for Indiana’s work-study program from 12 to 10 hours per week.
The state currently matches 50% of the hourly wage for high school and college students who participate in Employment Aid Readiness Network (EARN) Indiana. A fiscal analysis expects the change to increase the number of participating employers and students.
Although earlier versions of the legislation sought to add new literacy endorsement mandates for school administrators, those provisions were ultimately deleted. A state law passed last year still requires Hoosier teachers to complete the 80-hour training.

Justin Pearson, Karen Camper, John Ray Clemmons and Gabby Salinas on the House floor during debate over measures to strip consideration of race, ethnicity, sex or age from hiring decisions. (Photo: John Partipilo/John Partipilo)Two bills barring state and local governments, school districts and public colleges and universities from having diversity, equity and inclusion offices and considering race, ethnicity, sex or age in employment decisions will go to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.
The “Dismantling DEI Departments Act” and the “Dismantle DEI in Employment Act” are meant to align Tennessee with the priorities of President Donald Trump’s administration, according to Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican and the senate sponsor of both bills.
The Republican supermajority’s passage of the bills came over the staunch opposition of their Democratic colleagues — many of whom are minorities — who recounted their personal experiences facing hiring discrimination because of their race or ethnicity.
Johnson and House sponsor, Clarksville Republican Rep. Aron Maberry, said diversity is beneficial but DEI is a form of discrimination and enforces “ideological viewpoints.” They said the bills aim to center merit, qualifications, skill and competency in employment decisions, and diversity will “happen naturally through fair hiring practices.”
“The big problem in DEI is equity. We all know diversity, we all love including people. Equity is not equality, and it’s not about treating people fairly or ensuring equal opportunity … equity in the context of DEI is essentially that everybody gets the same outcome,” Maberry said.
Sen. Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat, said it is “funny” people believe they live in a post-racial society. 
“Because, quite frankly, as much as we aspire for the ideals of Dr. King, where people are not judged by the color of their skin but the content of their character, that is not the case,” Akbari said.

Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat, said DEI initiatives are meant to address groups of people who are fully qualified but have been excluded from access to resources and jobs. 
“You can’t even be considered for these jobs if you don’t meet the basic criteria,” Lamar said Tuesday. “So the idea that people are being chosen based on their race or their gender is false.”
The Senate passed both bills Tuesday. The House passed the “Dismantling DEI Departments Act” Tuesday, and passed its counterpart last week after the bill’s supporters cut debate short.
“Many of us were denied the opportunity to even speak and represent our people,” Democratic Caucus Leader Rep. Karen Camper said Tuesday. “Not only were we silenced, but really it almost felt like we (were dismissed). It was a lot of laughter and smugness, as if our lived experience of discrimination and injustice in this country were nothing more than some political talking points.”
What the legislation says
The “Dismantling DEI Departments Act” prohibits state and local governments, public institutions of higher education, and governor-appointed boards from using “a discriminatory preference in an effort to increase diversity, equity, or inclusion or maintain an office, division, or department for such purposes.” 
Decisions that grant or withhold benefits must be based on “individual merit, qualifications, veteran status or lawful eligibility criteria,” according to the bill. The legislation also scrubs Tennessee Code of provisions that encourage support of women- and minority-owned businesses and goals for including minorities on appointed boards.
  “Not only were we silenced, but really it almost felt like we (were dismissed). It was a lot of laughter and smugness, as if our lived experience of discrimination and injustice in this country were nothing more than some political talking points,” said House Minority Leader Karen Camper, a Memphis Democrat.

The act exempts demographic-based outreach for medically substantiated reasons in public health, medical research or disease prevention programs, in addition to “lawful and neutral outreach programs that ensure equal access to state services or contracting” as long as there is no demographic-based “preferential treatment.”
Entities can also submit written notice to the state comptroller requesting an exemption if complying with the act would cause the loss of federal funding.
The “Dismantle DEI in Employment Act” prohibits government entities in Tennessee from “considering race, ethnicity, sex, age, or any other demographic characteristic” in employment decisions.
It contains the same exemption request process for instances that would jeopardize federal funding.
Johnson and Maberry said neither bill will affect existing state laws or programs that support people with disabilities.
Rep. Harold Love, Jr., a Nashville Democrat, said the legislation has implications beyond the printed word. Love described a “chilling effect”: people who are hiring may reconsider selecting minorities for roles even if they are qualified, because they don’t want to be perceived as breaking these laws.
Rejected amendments
The Senate rejected an amendment proposed by Nashville Democratic Sen. Jeff Yarbro that would have prohibited hiring on the basis of familial relationship, past or present political activity, campaign involvement, service as an elected official, financial contributions and referrals by elected officials, political appointees or campaign representatives that were not based on merit.
Johnson said those issues were already covered by two pieces of legislation regarding state government employment. In rejecting the amendment, the legislature declined to extend these rules to local governments and educational institutions throughout the state.
Yarbro said some of the pieces of Tennessee Code eliminated or re-written by this legislation had been on the books for decades.
“Using this political cudgel that’s been developed in the last three or four years as a rationale to go back in time and repeal progress that was made in the 70s, 80s and 90s? We shouldn’t do that,” Yarbro said.
The House rejected an amendment proposed by Rep. Larry Miller, a Memphis Democrat, that would have required reporting on hirings and firings based on merit broken down by demographic. Miller argued the amendment should be welcome if the supermajority thought it would prove their justification for the bill.

– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


Johnson, when pressed by Lamar for examples of situations in which someone has been hired based on race or gender over merit, said he had examples but could not disclose them. 
“If you’ve not been contacted by someone who feels like they were overlooked because of diversity, I don’t know what to say about that,” Johnson said.
Asked if Black people or women currently employed by state or local governmental entities were hired based on their qualifications or their demographics, Johnson said he believes they were hired because they were qualified, but the DEI movement has become “insidious.”
The legislation does not infringe on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he said, noting he is “glad (those protections) are there.”
“Diversity is a good thing, but diversity for diversity’s sake alone is not a good thing,” Johnson said.
Several representatives later said on the house floor that they do not know of any Black man who has gotten a job who was not qualified for that position. 
Rep. Antonio Parkinson, a Memphis Democrat, said DEI is not meant to put one group of people above another.
“It is simply to show you that we exist,” he said. “It removes the invisible cloak from veterans, disabled individuals, Black people, women and others. We exist.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Legislation making it a crime to harbor, hide or conceal individuals without lawful immigration status is headed to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk.
The bill by (HB322/SB392) by Rep. Chris Todd of Madison County and Sen. Brent Taylor of Memphis, both Republicans, creates the new state crime of “human smuggling” — defined as transporting, concealing, harboring or shielding from detection anyone living in the country illegally. 
Approved 73-22 Tuesday by Republicans in the House, the bill underwent significant revisions before its passage after pushback from faith-based and advocacy groups. 
The legislation originally criminalized the transportation, harboring or hiding of 10 or more immigrants without legal status by churches, charitable organizations as well as businesses and employers.
The version headed to the governor’s desk restricts the offense to harboring, transporting or hiding individuals without legal immigration status “for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.” It also includes added exceptions for healthcare facilities treating patients without legal immigration status and licensed Tennessee attorneys providing legal advice to immigrant clients.

The language nevertheless raised concern among some Democrats on Tuesday for continuing to leave faith-based and nonprofit organizations — and the individuals who work for them — vulnerable to criminal prosecution for acts of charity. Under the bill, human smuggling is a Class A felony carrying a prison sentence of 15-60 years and a fine of up to $50,000.
“You and your church will be held liable under this bill. It’s that simple. That’s it. It’s that clear,” Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat, said. “You are committing a crime of human smuggling if you provide shelter to someone.”
Earlier this month, Democrats in the Tennessee Senate noted the bill would also target immigrant-dependent industries, including farms and meat packing plants, that provide transportation or housing for workers.
Taylor, the bill’s Senate sponsor, noted employers could not be prosecuted for housing or transporting workers who provided fraudulent documents. 
Employers, however, will be held liable for the human smuggling offense for workers they know to be unlawfully present in the United States, he said. The state crime would be in addition to federal violations for employing unauthorized workers.
Bill to hold charities liable for providing housing to certain immigrants heads to governor’s desk

“If an employer is hiring illegal aliens…if they are violating the law, yes, they would be guilty of this,” Taylor said. 
Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, noted the legislation relies on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to determine whether an immigrant is residing in the country illegally — a determination the executive branch agency is not, by law, authorized to make, he said. 
“We’re not just saying someone has to be here illegally. That would be one thing,” Yarbro said during the April 16 Senate floor debate. “We’re saying they have to be here illegally as determined by this group that has no right to make that arbitration.”
Todd, the Republican representative sponsoring the bill, said Tuesday that one goal of the bill is to provide district attorneys and local law enforcement a tool to “catch folks before they get into a trafficking situation by catching the perpetrators when they’re actually in the act of snuggling.”  
The bill also gives the Tennessee attorney general the authority to dissolve any business or nonprofit that has “committed, or is about to commit a human trafficking offense or aggravated human trafficking.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A bill giving Tennessee public schools the right to refuse enrollment to children without legal immigration status — or the option to charge them tuition — is dead for the year after facing pushback over its fiscal impact, its constitutionality and what opponents said was its cruelty. 
The bill by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson and House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland — both Republicans — was one of the most controversial heard during the 2025 Tennessee legislative session, which came to an end Tuesday. Debates over the legislation drew large and often vocal protests that occasionally shut down committee hearings. 
Immigrant rights advocates celebrated the bill’s demise — for now. Lamberth said Tuesday he won’t pull the education bill from consideration until the two-year session of the 114th General Assembly ends sine die, or when it’s finally adjourned, which would be in 2026.
Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, cited the force of public protests at the state Capitol and advocacy efforts by families, clergy, educators and others in forcing the bill to stall, but warned efforts targeting immigrants were likely to continue in Tennessee.
“We showed lawmakers that Tennessee won’t tolerate attacks on children — and they were forced to listen,” she said in a statement. “But let’s be clear: The bill is dead for the 2025 session, but not forever…So yes — we’re celebrating this win. And we’re staying ready for what comes next.”
Tennessee Democrats universally opposed the bill, but the measure divided GOP lawmakers. 
The bill’s backers cited rising English-language learner costs in public schools and a hardline position against providing public education to students who lack legal status. 
‘Economically reckless’ Small businesses slam bill to bar immigrant kids from school

The legislation’s Republican sponsors also said they hoped the legislation to draw an immediate legal that would serve as a vehicle to overturn a 1982 Supreme Court decision guaranteeing all children the right to a public school education, regardless of immigration status.
Some Republicans, however, expressed discomfort over putting children at the center of a larger national debate over immigration. Others voiced concern over whether the measure would jeopardize more than $1 billion in federal education funds, as a state fiscal analysis warned it could. 
And Watson, one of the bill’s chief sponsors, faced increasing criticism from business owners, faith leaders and public school officials inside his own district. The Hamilton County School Board, representing the largest school system in Watson’s home district, voted unanimously to condemn the legislation last week and a coalition of all 79 school principals in the district publicly decried the legislation.
Hamilton County principals oppose bill to require immigration status checks on schoolchildren

Republicans in the Tennessee Senate nevertheless approved the legislation earlier this month, but their version of the bill differed from the House version in that it mandated all public K-12 and charter schools verify the immigration status of all public school children. 
The House version of the bill made the immigration checks optional — a provision that Lamberth doubled down on as the session neared completion.
Both versions of the bill gave schools the option of charging tuition for children without legal status — or rejecting their enrollment entirely. 
On Monday, at Lamberth’s request, the state’s Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic sent a letter to U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to determine whether the state could lose its federal funding tied to federal laws prohibiting discrimination. 
Lamberth had not gotten a reply by Tuesday evening and said he won’t recall the education bill from consideration until it can be reconsidered when the two-year session of the 114th General Assembly reconvenes in 2026.
The Legislature adjourned for the year Tuesday without the House taking up the bill.

(Getty Images)As a pediatric resident physician in Idaho, I am concerned about the recent signing of House Bill 93, the Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit bill, by Gov. Brad Little. This bill, which allows taxpayers to redirect state funds to private school scholarships, is a step backward for Idaho’s public education system and poses serious long-term risks to the future of our children.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs law that directs state funds to private school tuition

The Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit bill is a thinly veiled attempt to privatize education by diverting critical state funds away from public schools. It provides tax credits to individuals or corporations who contribute to private school scholarship organizations, ultimately funneling state resources into private institutions that are not held to the same standards of accountability, oversight, or inclusivity as our public schools. This not only diminishes funding for public schools but further entrenches educational inequality.
As a pediatrician, I understand the importance of a strong and equitable public education system for the health and development of children. Public schools serve as the cornerstone of our communities, providing every child-regardless of background, income, or identity with a safe space to learn and grow. 
The resources and programs available in our public schools are crucial, not just for academic learning, but also for promoting physical, emotional and social well-being. Disinvesting in public education will disproportionately harm our most vulnerable students: those from low-income families, children with disabilities and students of color.
The Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit bill also undermines the very principle of equitable access to education. By diverting state funding to private schools, we risk further expanding the gap between wealthy families who can afford private education and low-income families who rely on public schools. 
This is not just an issue of finances; it’s an issue of fairness. Every child, no matter what their background is, deserves access to high-quality education.
Idaho’s children deserve the best opportunities for success. Rather than diverting resources away, our focus should be on strengthening public schools, and ensuring every child in these schools has the tools, support, and opportunities they need to thrive. As a physician and concerned citizen, I believe we should work to ensure public education remains strong and equitable for all Idaho students. I firmly stand against this change.

(Sydnei Tatum for West Virginia Watch)MCDOWELL COUNTY, West Virginia — When the flood water swept through McDowell County, West Virginia, in February, Ashley Rutherford sat in her wheelchair, unable to get out of her home as the water started coming through the doorway. One of her sons put rubber rain boots on her to cover her legs while the water came in.
Nine weeks later, the carpet in the home is still wet. The kitchen’s wooden floor is damp and buckling, and Rutherford’s wheelchair got stuck in a new hole in front of the sink. The downstairs rooms are full of her family’s stuff, crowding the path for her to get around.
“I’m overwhelmed,” said Rutherford, 33, a mother of four. “We’re living out of totes right now. My daughter can’t find the right outfit she wants to wear to school.” 
Rutherford lives in War, the poor county’s most southern town. In its hollers, residents — many of whom are elderly — are waiting for help. They need federal aid. A stove. Volunteers to help them clear the thick mud from their basements.
There hasn’t been nearly enough help, and people feel forgotten by disaster relief agencies, nonprofit organizations and state government leaders in Charleston. 
Many of McDowell’s residents are unable or unlikely to leave their long-time family homes, resulting in them now sitting in damp structures — some still without heat or running water — while mold starts to set in. 
  Mold has started growing in Dale Blevins’ basement in McDowell County after the flood. (Sydnei Tatum for West Virginia Watch)
Dale Blevins, 70, stood in her damp basement, where patches of crystalized white mold were forming on the concrete walls. Volunteers cleaned out her basement after the flood; she didn’t know who would come in to remove the mold. Her husband relies on an oxygen tank, and the mold was likely already a danger for his health. 
“I hate to ask for help,” she said, adding she hadn’t heard from any local or state officials.  “Nobody has ever come here.”
The National Guard, church groups and other volunteers made their way through the county to help out. Those efforts have largely dried up. The local churches, many with elderly congregations, are limited in how they can help. Hundreds of homes still need to be cleared out and cleaned, residents say. 
“We need the boots on the ground who are physically able to do the muck outs,” said Michael Brooks, a McDowell County commissioner. “It is hard work, it’s brutal work and very time consuming … I don’t know if some realize how dire the need is.”
Sydnei Tatum, 33, is a local business owner and photographer who took the images for this story. Over the last two months, she has cleaned out basements, handed out grocery gift cards and made lists of residents in need of everything from beds to refrigerators.
“I’m gonna fight for these people, because they have no one else to do it for them,” she said.
Tatum blamed the lack of recovery efforts on state leaders’ failure to prioritize McDowell County. They’d downplayed the crisis, she said. 
“Purely because nobody is interested in the poorest areas of the county, and we are in it,” she said.
In February, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the state “was in a position to act quickly,” while also requesting a federal disaster declaration to unlock resources for affected counties. 
“We want to make sure we’re helping these southern counties recover,” Morrisey said at a press conference on Feb. 20 after visiting some parts of McDowell. 
His spokesperson didn’t reply to questions for this story about the status of recovery efforts. 
The flooding, which killed three people, happened during the legislative session; it wasn’t a major topic among lawmakers. 
There isn’t dedicated funding in the recently-approved state budget for McDowell’s flood recovery.

Limited county funds, endless clean-up work 
Carol Lester, 73, stood on her porch in Bartley, overlooking her washed out, sandy yard. She’d survived the flood, having to be rescued by two young men as water rushed into her kitchen and living room. She recalled how 911 couldn’t help her, then two men showed up and carried her husband, who is disabled, through the woods for five hours in the cold rain. 
“We’ve been through five floods. This was the worst,” said Lester, who has been in her home for 51 years. “It seemed like you could hear the devil and his demons in that water.”
A destroyed sofa set was discarded in front of her house. It needed to be hauled away. She was waiting on a plywood delivery, hopeful that her family members could rip up her water-logged flooring.
No one other than Tatum had been by her house since the flood, Lester said. 










Nobody cares, I'm telling you, this day and time.

Before the flood, McDowell was already facing hardships. It’s one of the poorest counties in the country, and some residents haven’t had clean drinking water for decades. Much of the county is located on a flood plain, and floods have swept through before. Fewer than 18,000 people now live in the county now that mining jobs have dried up.
The drop in population has impacted county finances reliant on local taxpayers, and Brooks explained that the bulk of money collected through personal property taxes goes to the board of education.
There isn’t enough left over, he said. 
Thirty-six private bridges were washed out in the flood, some of which can’t be covered by Federal Emergency Management Assistance (FEMA) or county money. Some bridges may never be repaired.
“I wish to God that we had the funding that we could start fixing it. But, it’s not a few thousand dollar fix. It’s a hundreds of thousands dollar issue on some of the bridges,” Brooks said. 
Brooks was frustrated over social media comments saying the county or state wasn’t doing enough. Morrisey had been helpful, he said, and required-government processes can be slow.
“I am bombarded, as well as the other commissioners, with more questions than answers at this juncture,” he said. “It’s not that we’re not trying to garner the answers or we’re trying to shrug these things off. But we’re a small county and a lot of times we don’t have resources.”
FEMA, which continues its efforts in the county, and Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) didn’t return requests for comment for this story. Some residents said they weren’t expecting much help from the federal aid.

Debris-filled water poses a future flood risk 
The floors are still damp in Linda Wood’s home in the community of Berwind.
“I’m going to need new flooring, like linoleum,” said Woods, 61. She lost her stove, lawnmower, clothes, shoes and more in the flooding.
“I’m worried about the moisture getting under the mattress and causing mold,” she added.
Rain is forecasted this weekend in McDowell, causing anxiety for Woods. She pointed to a nearby stream, filled with debris leftover from the flood. Without clearing it out, she said, another flood was likely to hit her community at any time. 
The area’s stream beds haven’t been dredged or restored since the 1977 flood, WVVA reported. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., recently visited McDowell, promising to request money to clean up the streams in hopes of preventing future flooding. 
Earlier this year, Morrisey didn’t request funding for the state’s flood mitigation efforts through the State Resiliency Office. The Republican-majority in the House of Delegates rejected a Democratic lawmakers’ proposal to put $50 million in the state budget to protect from future floods.
Politics and state funding aren’t the main topics of conversation among McDowell residents in April. Neighbors are wondering how they’ll clean out their basements and remove the mountains of debris scattered alongside roads. There aren’t large dumpsters in the area, and the county would need to work with the state to create a designated dumping site.
Lester looked at a holly bush in her yard that had survived the flood. Her husband bought it for her years ago. 
“God left that holly bush for a reason. It weathered the storm, but it still survived,” she said. “Every morning, when I get up, I look at the little holly bush. I get my strength from that.”

High school students were reading, studying, and hanging out on a Tuesday afternoon at the Shaker Heights Public Library, just seven miles east of downtown Cleveland, when a confrontation broke out between two teenagers. It started with pushes and shoves, but then one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting. In the end, 18-year-old Charles Lee Shanklin was killed, and a 15-year-old was arrested on several charges, including carrying a concealed weapon and murder. 
Since 2021, shooting and homicide numbers have declined throughout Cleveland, in keeping with national trends. Children and teenagers, however, are still bearing the burden of firearm injuries and deaths in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located. Since 2010, shooting deaths among people 18 and younger have more than tripled in Cuyahoga, rising to 37 in 2023, the latest year for which data is available. 
The youth firearm homicide rate is more than 30% higher in Cuyahoga than it is in three comparable counties — Allegheny County, in Pennsylvania; Franklin County, Ohio; and Wayne County, Michigan, which includes Detroit. From 2020 to 2023, according to The Trace’s analysis of census data and statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Cuyahoga’s youth firearm death rate averaged to 17 per 100,000 residents, including a six-point jump between 2019 and 2020. A report by the Cuyahoga County Board of Health found that overall child fatalities in 2023 reached a five-year high, and 19% of them were by firearm. Last year, 41 people under 18 in the county were charged with homicide, which matched the record set in 2023.

Cleveland, which is the largest city in the county, is responsible for around 75% of all homicides countywide, and a gun is used in over 80% of them. 
“Every week it seems like someone I know gets killed,” said Delano Griffin, a 17-year-old resident of East Cleveland. “You just never feel safe.”
Like other midwestern cities, downtown Cleveland is separated by just a few miles from the historically redlined and neglected neighborhoods surrounding the metropolitan area, like East Cleveland, Garfield Heights, St. Clair Superior, and Central. Police data shows those neighborhoods struggle the most with gun violence. All of them are predominantly Black. The vast majority of gun deaths in Cleveland are among Black men. Cleveland’s Black population is 47%  — yet its Black residents make up nearly 85% of all gunshot victims. 
Local activists said pinpointing a single reason for the higher rates of shootings among young people is difficult, but they said poverty plays a major role. Myesha Watkins, who runs the Cleveland Peacemakers Alliance, a community-led violence prevention and intervention group that focuses on children and teens, said the economic hardship young people experience can make them feel their lives are out of their own control. They can feel they have no choice but to get involved in street activity, and might even pick up a gun 
“A lot of the actions and the choices they’re making are because of the unmet needs of somebody that’s caring for them,” Watkins said. According to U.S. Census estimates, Cleveland has the single highest child poverty rate of any U.S. city with a population of more than 300,000, at 45%.
Demetrius Williams, who runs Beat The Streets Cleveland, a nonprofit program that gives young people access to mentoring, youth development, and wrestling, said that the peer pressure is heavy. “A lot of times they come from these type of environments, and everybody in your neighborhood is doing it, everybody that you been surrounded by is doing it,” Williams said. “Once they’re caught up in it, that’s it.”

Local activists point to other issues, like accessibility to resources, mental health services, and job training, combined with a lack of dependable financial investment from the city. 
“Young people who are already on the cusp of being involved in violence are living in a system that hasn’t been set up for them to succeed,” said Sonya Pryor-Jones, who runs the Office of Prevention, Intervention and Opportunity for Youth and Young Adults in the Mayor’s Office.

In 2023, Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb announced the Neighborhood Safety Fund, which allocated $10 million in grant money from American Rescue Plan Act funds to invest in violence prevention. From it, 44 different groups have so far received an average of $46,000 each, totaling roughly $2 million. The year before, the city was awarded a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Justice for the creation of Cleveland Thrive, a community violence intervention coalition meant to bring groups together and build a strategy to reduce gun violence. It’s led to some collaboration, including a gun violence training program, but activists say it hasn’t been enough. 
“We have to get the right resources to these areas. We cannot expect everything to change if we’re giving limited resources to people who need it the most,” said Richard Starr, a City Council member who represents several neighborhoods stricken by gun violence, including Central. He’s leading an effort to establish gun violence as a public health crisis in Cleveland, which would enable the federal Department of Health and Human Services to help fund a centralized Office of Violence Prevention. 
Local community organizations are appreciative of the existing funding, but “the biggest thing is getting consistent money, and a lot of groups that are working with these kids are not getting it consistently,” Williams said. That instability has them all vying for the same bucket of dollars, part of the reason many community organizations are doing their gun violence prevention work in silos — and struggling to sustain their efforts.

“Collectively, if we come together and share resources and share language and share data, we can do a lot more and cover a lot more,” Watkins said. 
More importantly, though, the infighting projects a lack of legitimacy to young people who are faced with picking up a gun. “The youth are not dumb, when they see us beefing within ourselves, it’s a problem,” Williams said. 
Delano Griffin, the 17-year-old who lives in Garfield Heights, said he appreciates anyone from his area stepping up to help the kids — but he hadn’t heard of most of the community programs that exist specifically for him. If they want to address gun deaths, Griffin said the decision-makers downtown need to do a better job of reaching out. “They shouldn’t forget about us,” he said. “We live in this city, too.”

(Leann Ray | West Virginia Watch)West Virginia has a foster care problem, and despite lawmakers introducing several bills to try to address the issues, only one of those passed both chambers. The governor has yet to sign it into law.
That one bill — House Bill 2880 — passed on the final night of the legislative session. Sponsored by Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis — who is a foster parent — the bill will create a “Parent Resource Navigator” to help reunite a parent and child.
That’s the main goal of foster care — to reunite children with their parents once they are safely able to care for them. But we have to be realistic and understand that unfortunately many of these children will be in the foster care system until they age out.
There are currently 5,955 children in the state’s custody. As Amelia Ferrell Knisely has reported, many of these children aren’t even in foster homes because there’s a shortage of foster parents. Many children are sleeping in hotels in the state because there’s not enough beds available for them, and the state spent $70 million in 2024 to send children to out-of-state facilities. 
The majority of children who end up in foster care in West Virginia are there in part because of parental substance use disorder or neglect, the West Virginia Centers on Budget and Policy reported. Child abuse allegations involving drug endangerment here is four times the national average.
There were no bills introduced to increase recovery efforts for people who lost custody of their children. And last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey cut from the state budget $250,000 for Lily’s Place, a nonprofit organization in Cabell County that provides support for families dealing with substance use disorder. 
There were plenty of bills related to foster care that were introduced during the 60-day session, showing that some lawmakers do care about improving the situation. Let’s take a look at the bills that died.
HB 2035 would have established a three-year guardian ad litem pilot program in three judicial courts. Cindy Largent-Hill, director of the state Supreme Court of Appeals Division of Children’s Services, told lawmakers during the legislative session that there aren’t nearly enough lawyers for child abuse cases, and the ones who are available are assigned to a child’s case as a guardian ad litem for a least one year. Most guardians ad litem cover 12 counties, she said. The bill died in House Finance.
HB 2047 would have prohibited cameras and recording devices in bedrooms and bathrooms of foster children. The bill clarifies that baby monitors may be used when age appropriate for the child, or if the child has been medically diagnosed with severe physical disabilities or behavioral, cognitive, or psychological disorders. Children deserve their privacy and to not be monitored in their private spaces if there’s no medical need for it.The bill died in the Senate Health and Human Resources.
HB 3382 would have required the Department of Human Services to establish, either on its own or through a contract, a central reception center and emergency resource homes for foster children for up to 72 hours when a home can’t be found immediately for them. There are currently 148 children living in the state’s emergency shelters. The bill died in House Finance.
HB 3379 would minimize children bouncing from home to home, and it would allow the state to terminate parental rights more quickly to allow a child to find a permanent foster home. West Virginia permanently terminates parent rights more often than any state — at a speed nearly 40% faster than the national average, according to the West Virginia Centers on Budget and Policy. The bill also would have shortened the timeframe to reunite foster children with their biological siblings, and would have loosened requirements for reuniting if it wasn’t in the child’s best interest. The bill received pushback from child welfare groups who said the requirements conflict with federal child welfare laws that prioritize biological family and sibling reuniting. The bill died in House Health and Human Resources.
HB 2086 would have developed a plan to monitor and improve reading and math skills of children who have been in the foster care system. The bill died in House Education
HB 2033 would have loosened vaccination requirements for biological children of foster parents and allowed families to foster despite their religious beliefs related to sexual orientation and sexual identity. This bill would have put LGBTQ+ children in danger. Luckily, this bill died in House Health and Human Resources.
HB 2542 would have required Child Protective Services workers to record audio of all interactions during CPS visits. A committee substitute removed language to require recordings, changing it to “permitting” audio recording instead. The bill died in House Health and Human Resources.
HB 2027 would have prevented children from being removed from foster homes if they had been placed there for 15 months or 50% of their life unless it was in the best interest of the child to do so. The bill died in Health and Human Resources.
It’s great that there were so many bills introduced related to helping children in the foster care system, but why couldn’t lawmakers get them over the finish line? Why were other bills prioritized over these?
If there are so many children that we don’t have enough room to house them all, the state should be working to create more homes and more beds for them to sleep in. The state could be offering incentives for people to foster children, or do literally anything to make child care options more available and more affordable. Think of the obstacles that keep families from choosing to foster, and try to eliminate them.
From 2017 until July 2024, there were more than 6,000 children in foster care in the state every year. Last summer was the first time that number dipped below 6,000, and now that number is still more than 5,950.
If the state can spend $70 million a year to send children out of state, surely it can spend $70 million to build new facilities, or expand existing ones. If lawmakers aren’t going to address the issues relating to foster care, then they need to accept that we’re going to have around 6,000 children who need homes, and to have enough space for all of them.

(Getty Images)LOUISVILLE — Louisvillians spend more than a week every year breathing unhealthy air, according to new data from the American Lung Association. 
The 2025 “State of the Air” report shows that about 125 million Americans live in counties that have a failing grade for ozone pollution, also known as smog. 
In Louisville, “unhealthy days” for ozone pollution number eight per year on average — an increase from the average of five reported in the 2024 report. Ozone pollution can come from a variety of sources including cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants and more, according to the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA).
The American Lung Association has given Jefferson County a grade of  “F” for ground-level ozone pollution because of the increase in unhealthy days. Louisville got a failing grade in the 2024 report as well. 
Louisville also sees an average of 2.2 unhealthy days for particle pollution per year, up from the average of 1.3 reported in 2024. The city earned a “D” in that category, according to the report, down from a “C” in last year’s report. Particle pollution can come from many sources, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires, according to the EPA. 
Louisville’s air ranks  32nd worst in the nation in this report, an improvement  from 27th worst in the 2024 report. 
When evaluating ozone and short-term particle pollution, researchers compared data from 2021-2023. The report examines all U.S. counties with available data, though many areas don’t have monitoring infrastructure. 
“Air pollution impacts health,” said Shannon Baker, the advocacy director for the Lung Association in Kentucky. “Both ozone and particle pollution cause premature death and other serious health effects, including asthma attacks, and we have a high asthma rate here in Kentucky. Particle pollution can cause lung cancer, which we should be especially concerned about here in Kentucky.” 
Kentucky already has the nation’s highest rate of lung cancer cases and one of the worst survival rates for the disease. 
Other counties in Kentucky are far less affected, the report shows. Fayette County, the second most populous, got a “B” grade. Warren County, which is home to Bowling Green, earned a “B” as well. 
“Irrespective of the number of people exposed to pollution, the impact on health is the same,” Baker said. “Talking about ozone or smog, Louisville just continues to struggle.”

The report 
“The news is not good for Louisville, but it is not entirely atypical,” Baker said. 
From 2021–2023, about 37% of the United States population “were exposed to levels of ozone that put their health at risk,” the report says. That’s an increase of nearly 25 million people from the 2024 report. 
The report attributes the increase in people exposed to unhealthy ozone levels to climate change, citing extreme heat and wildfires as contributing culprits. Smoke from the 2023 Canadian wildfires that hazed over Louisville contributed to Jefferson County’s worsening score, Baker explained. 
Kentucky’s floods also contribute to the polluted air, Baker said. She urged caution for people cleaning up and rebuilding.

“Standing water is a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses and mold, and those things can become airborne and be inhaled, putting people at risk for lung disease,” she said. “After this flooding emergency, we risk inhaling dust and building materials and contaminants and microorganisms during cleanup, which also add to lung disease complications.” 
In early April, large swaths of Kentucky, including Louisville, faced significant flooding. The Ohio River at Louisville peaked at 68 feet during that event, much higher than its normal 20-30 feet. 
“People need to be protecting themselves from exposure to these airborne particles and gasses, wearing gloves and goggles, as an example, and knowing that materials that can be cleaned and dried should be cleaned and dried thoroughly,” Baker said. “We shouldn’t use bleach to do that, so the water will work just fine, but, when in doubt about the cleaning and thorough drying, throw it out. Remove everything that has been soaked by water like clothing and furnishings and carpet and ceiling tiles, anything that can’t be cleaned and dried.”

The call to action: Protect the EPA, reduce personal carbon footprint 
The report urges the federal government to protect the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA), saying the organization’s “key principles are to follow the science, follow the law and be transparent.” 
“Those principles have guided decades of progress toward cleaner air. But efforts to undercut them put the agency’s core mission at risk,” the report says. “The bottom line is this: EPA staff, working in communities across the country, are doing crucial work to keep your air clean. Staff cuts are already impacting people’s health across the country. Further cuts mean more dirty air.” 
The report cites President Donald Trump’s executive orders that “seek to overturn regulatory policies that reduce pollution from electricity generation and transportation,” in defending the EPA’s work. 
In early March, the EPA announced the “greatest and most consequential day of deregulation” for its agency as it moved to implement Trump’s goals. 
“While accomplishing EPA’s core mission of protecting the environment, the agency is committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to unleash American energy, lower cost of living for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, restore the rule of law, and give power back to states to make their own decisions,” the EPA said at that time.  
On Monday, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration will “cancel tens of millions of dollars in grants to scientists studying environmental hazards faced by children in rural America, among other health issues.” The Times cited internal emails by EPA officials. 
“The Lung Association is calling on everyone to support and defend the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency, to protect human health and the environment,” Baker said. “It’s the EPA’s job to write and enforce rules that that make sure air pollution gets cleaned up to levels that are safer for people to breathe. It’s based on science, and we know that mission is under threat right now by federal actions to gut EPA staffing and programs and even rolling back rules that save lives.”
  Particle pollution is made of tiny particles. They are so small they lodge deep in the lungs and can enter bloodstream. This can cause heart attacks, lung cancer and asthma attacks. This image depicts particle sizes compared to fine beach sand and human hair. (American Lung Association)




How to reduce personal carbon footprint
The Columbia Climate School offers suggestions for lowering individual carbon footprints. They include:

Avoid buying fast fashion clothes, which result in significant waste, and buy durable clothes or recycled items instead. Think: vintage and thrift stores. 
Use reusable bags when shopping. 
Turn off lights and unplug electronics when they’re not in use.
Find ways to drive less — carpool, bike, walk or use public transportation — when possible. 
Travel by airplane as little as possible. When you travel by air, try to book a nonstop flight to create fewer take-offs and landings.

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Kaul said Wisconsin is currently involved in 11 multi-state lawsuits challenging various actions of the federal government. Among them are cases related to massive staffing cuts in the U.S. Department of Education, termination of health funding and an executive order to end birthright citizenship.
Kaul said many programs are being changed drastically. He discussed possible impacts of Social Security staff cuts as an example and encouraged people to reach out to the Wisconsin Department of Justice and share how these policy changes are affecting them.
Last month, Kaul unsuccessfully attempted to block Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks at an event supporting Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel, who lost the recent election to Susan Crawford. The state Supreme Court turned down Kaul’s petition.
In Kaul’s opinion, “having rules that regulate petitions that are circulated right before an election, having rules that make clear that inducements to register to vote are problematic would be helpful,” he said. “And I think having statutes that make clear what it means to induce somebody to vote would be helpful.”
Kaul also described his pitch for money for services for crime victims in the state budget. Lower allocations from the federal Victims of Crime Act left providers scrambling, and Kaul said some providers have cut back on their hours and some have cut back on services. 
“Crime victim services, for those of you who aren’t familiar, can make a critical difference in the lives of people who are victims of crime,” Kaul said. “…They can help ensure that the victim’s rights are protected.”
Crime victim services can also help lead a person “to want to work with law enforcement and hold a perpetrator accountable, and that makes all of us safer,” he said. 
“So, essentially, what we’re talking about at the current level of funding is programs being stretched to the breaking point,” Kaul said. “That’s something I’ve heard from victim advocates.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Congressman Steve Womack listen. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)State and federal leaders discussed using federal funding effectively to address affordable housing issues during a visit by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to Northwest Arkansas Tuesday. 
HUD Secretary Scott Turner spent the day visiting with high school students and learning about the impact of Opportunity Zone projects, among other things, at U.S. Rep. Steve Womack’s invitation. An invitation to Womack’s Washington colleagues also resulted in the National Institutes of Health director visiting Arkansas in October. 
Womack is the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies. Following a tour of Hillcrest Towers, a 120-unit public housing complex in Fayetteville for tenants 55 and older and/or disabled, Womack told reporters the emphasis on the transportation side of appropriations will be on the Federal Aviation Administration. 
“The housing side, the goal, the objective was to make sure in a time of declining resources and potential cuts, we don’t want one person losing the housing that they have enjoyed,” Womack said. 
President Donald Trump in March signed a continuing resolution that will fund the government through Sept. 30 and included an additional $4.6 billion for HUD programs, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Womack said there will be challenges to writing the fiscal year 2026 appropriation bills. 
“Notably the fact that the amount of money that’s set aside for discretionary spending continues to shrink over time because of the impact on the entitlement programs and the fact that that side of the balance sheet is growing exponentially,” he said. “So we will always have a challenge, and there will be emerging needs.”
Stalled affordable teacher housing project finds new life in Northwest Arkansas

Entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are included in mandatory spending that Congress is required to fund. They make up almost two-thirds of the federal budget, according to Everything Policy.  
Turner said his agency doesn’t hold the purse strings, so it’s HUD’s job to “maximize the budget that we do have and make sure that we’re very efficient and effective” about the resources his team distributes. At the same time, the agency’s goal is not to grow the amount of people who need government assistance, but rather “get people off subsidies and live a life of self-sustainability,” Turner said.  
“So working with nonprofits, working with faith-based institutions, working with some of the public-private partnerships like I’ve seen done so well here in Northwest Arkansas, I believe that that’s the way that we can attack this situation and attack the problem,” he said. 
One of the public-private partnerships Turner learned about during his visit was McAuley Place, a project that aims to provide affordable housing to Bentonville School District employees who are often priced out of living where they work. 
The state’s role in addressing affordable housing, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, is “working very closely” with the state’s congressional delegation and the Trump administration. A lot of funding for affordable housing programs comes from the federal government, and Sanders said it’s important to look at whether money is being spent “efficiently and effectively.” While that’s often the case, there’s still room for improvement, she said. 
“I think it’s one of the things that President Trump is really delivering on is taking a holistic approach to where are we spending money, how can we do a better job, how can we be more modern, more efficient, more innovative,” Sanders said. “When we’re $36 trillion in debt, we have to do a better job of spending the money we have in a better and more effective way.”

(John Finney Photography via Getty Images)When it comes to slowing the impact of climate change, reducing as much methane as we can, as fast as we can, is the most impactful and cost-effective action we can take. After working to reduce this highly polluting greenhouse gas from Colorado’s coal, mining, oil, and gas sectors, the administration of Gov. Jared Polis just took a major step toward reducing the mountains of methane emanating from an overlooked source: landfills.
Every year, Colorado’s landfills emit an estimated 4.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of methane — the same climate impact as adding a staggering 1 million gas-powered cars to the road. In addition to methane, landfills leak leachate and a cocktail of pollutants into nearby communities, often disproportionately affecting people of color and low-income residents who already shoulder the heaviest burdens of climate change.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For example, 45% of Colorado’s landfills are located near communities where a higher-than-average number of households have low household incomes. The toxic pollution from landfills puts these residents at increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions and often is on top of other cumulative impacts. More than half of Colorado’s landfills are located in areas where asthma, cancer and melanoma rates are higher than the state average.
The impacts of these landfills are more than just statistics: Across the country, residents who live near landfills routinely report chronic respiratory conditions, migraines and more. Fortunately, earlier this month, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment released a new draft of emissions standards for landfills that raise the bar for landfill management and will result in cleaner air for millions of Coloradans. The state’s Air Quality Control Commission voted to advance these draft regulations and is on track to finalize updated standards this August.
CDPHE’s draft rule gets a lot right. For starters, it includes smart provisions like more effective gas collection systems, a significantly reduced threshold for what constitutes a methane exceedance, and landfill cover practices designed to keep methane in the ground. It also closes loopholes that allow pollutants to escape. For example, EPA research reveals that half of the carbon in food waste degrades into methane within 3.6 years. Yet, current state standards allow five years to pass before expanding gas collection systems. This timeline mismatch enables huge amounts of methane to escape into the atmosphere, and CDPHE’s standards propose making a simple but necessary fix. Finally, in a nationwide first, the draft rule includes language requiring landfill operators to mitigate large methane leaks identified via satellite or aerial surveys.
However, while CDPHE’s rule takes meaningful steps to modernize how landfills find and control methane, there’s still further to go. Because methane is invisible, it’s often hiding in plain sight. Huge advancements in methane monitoring technology make finding and fixing emissions easier than ever. Yet, despite the availability and cost-effectiveness of advanced detection tools like drones and sensors, CDPHE’s proposed rule makes using such technology optional rather than a required best practice. I hope to see the final rule rise to the occasion by embracing cutting-edge technology and leading the industry — and the country — into the future.
Colorado is no stranger to bold climate action. During my tenure as governor, I signed over 50 bills that transformed our state’s energy sector to be sustainable and secure, including legislation that expanded our renewable energy portfolio and helped transition the state away from coal. Now, as we face the challenge of landfill methane emissions, the state is poised to lead the nation once more and provide a blueprint for other states to follow. We have the tools and the technology to mitigate methane pollution, and the time to act is now. I urge the Air Quality Control Commission to pass and implement an ambitious, science-backed landfill emissions rule and provide cleaner air for millions of residents across the Centennial State.

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)With Virginia poised to elect its first woman governor later this year, the future of its state legislature is also female. 
About 80 House of Delegates candidates are women, representing Democrats, Republicans and third party contenders. They are incumbents and challengers in primary or general elections vying for a role in the House, where all 100 seats are up for election. Of the 86 non-incumbents running statewide, 41 of those are women, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. 
Those numbers could fluctuate over the next month or so as several districts have multi-person primaries and additional independent candidates have until June 17 to get on the ballot for November’s general elections.  
With Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger battling for the governor’s mansion, the women seeking seats in the House can help boost their gubernatorial campaigns, too. 
 The top of the ticket

Virginia elections draw national scrutiny and lots of attention from political pundits, since its state elections follow close on the heels of presidential contests. 
A year after President Donald Trump’s first election, Virginia’s 2017 House races ushered in a “Blue Wave” and laid the groundwork for a Democratic trifecta. Similarly, Virginia’s 2021 elections — a year after Democrat Joe Biden was sent to the White House —  ignited a red takeover with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s election and Republicans winning control in the House of Delegates for a term. 
While presidential or congressional midterm elections nationwide typically see higher turnouts than other election years, Virginia’s unique timing of its state elections offers insight to pundits. But it also showcases which issues motivate Virginians specifically. 
“These off-off year elections have lower turnout so it matters which side is motivated,” said political analyst Jessica Taylor with Cook Political Report. 
Though most of the past two decades have seen Virginia elect a governor of the opposite party that won the White House the year before — and thus also benefit that party in House races — both Virginia’s gubernatorial candidates have top-down benefits to draw from. 
“Earle-Sears’ biggest asset has been that Youngkin has remained popular and that the Virginia economy is doing well,” Taylor said. 
She cautioned, however, that Trump’s policies could end up hurting her down the line while benefiting Spanberger. Sweeping federal job cuts stemming from the president and advisor Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have made a big impact in Virginia and could have lingering effects, she said.
A government shutdown in Washington D.C. in 2013 shortly before that year’s statehouse elections may have played a role in Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s win, despite former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, winning the year before. 
Although the DOGE cuts are unfolding earlier in the year, Taylor suspects they could still influence voters by November. 
“Losing your job is more permanent than a furlough and a shutdown,” she said. 
Another factor, particularly as so many women are running up and down the ticket this year, could be reproductive laws. 
 Women ‘need to be in the room’

Virginia’s status as the least restrictive Southern state when it comes to abortion access is one that Democrats are working to keep — and permanently protect. 
The amendment needed to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution has only advanced on partisan lines, with Republican women lawmakers opposing it. Following the outcome of this year’s House elections, it will need to pass again before it can appear on statewide ballots for voters to weigh in. 
“These are things that directly impact us, our daughters and our granddaughters,” said House District 71 Democratic nominee Jessica Anderson. “I think (women) absolutely need to be in the room when these decisions are being made.”
All Republican delegates and senators opposed the amendment, but their party first tried to tweak it. They’d sought to insert existing state code requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortions.
While Republican women incumbents opposed the measure, they said they had their reasons. 
Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield grew tearful while describing the Democratic version of the bill as “extreme” and said that it would “strip away” parental rights. 
“How can we place such a heavy burden on young women across the commonwealth?” she asked her colleagues in January. “I cannot imagine my 15-year-old daughter having to face this decision without me.” 
Republicans had sought to insert existing state and federal protections for newborns into the abortion amendment, as well. Democrats rejected the insertions and advanced the proposed constitutional amendment as they’d written it. 
Coyner has sided with Democrats on some issues — like their constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to ex-felons who’ve served their time — but aligned with her party on the reproductive rights amendment. Three Democratic challengers — two men and a woman — will face off in a primary this June, and the victor will challenge Coyner in November. 
Del. Kim Taylor clinched her last re-election by just 53 votes; her rematch with challenger Kimberly Pope Adams is among the most competitive districts for both parties this year.
Parental rights at center of reproductive health debate

Taylor attempted to stake out a nuanced stance on reproductive health this year. Her House Bill 2562 would have shored up protections for abortions or abortion-like procedures as treatment for “nonviable” pregnancies, which lack a standard definition and are handled on a case-by-case basis by physicians. 
 A nonviable pregnancy is one that “cannot result in a live-born infant, including an ectopic pregnancy or failed intrauterine pregnancy,” as defined in Taylor’s bill. 
“We hear so often from the other side that this is a health care crisis, and that women are dying because there is an unclear standard of care,” she told The Mercury at the time. “Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures. This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
But the bill was never brought up for a vote, so it failed this legislative session by default.
Democrats, on the other hand, argue their amendment will best protect people’s reproductive needs and choices. Each Democratic woman challenger The Mercury spoke with for this story stressed their desire to help it advance.  
 Surge of Democrats

From red to blue to purple, Democrats are running candidates in nearly all 100 House of Delegates districts this year compared to Republicans, who are pitching candidates across 66 districts. Each challenger has their own reasons to take on the incumbents they’re hoping to unseat, but they’re also hoping to drive party turnout to the polls. 
“One of my jobs is to be a point guard to up-ballot candidates,” said House District 48 Democratic candidate Melody Ann Cartwright. 
She’s “not delusional” about how hard she will have to work campaigning in the Martinsville-anchored district that the Virginia Public Access Project labels “Strong Republican,” but she knows her campaign can help keep her party inspired. 
Though 2024 was a tough year for Democrats as Trump won the presidency, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried 59 of Virginia’s 100 House districts and secured the state’s 13 Electoral College votes.
While Democrats have a 51-49 majority, they hope to hold and expand it. Taking back the House could help Republicans balance the Democrats’ control of the Senate, which is not up for election this year. 
Some districts are highly competitive and offer each party a unique chance to claw back power around the state. 
In the New River Valley within Southwest Virginia, Democrat Lily Franklin nearly defeated Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, in 2023 and she’s hoping for victory in their rematch this year. Taylor and Pope Adams will go head-to-head again to represent their Petersburg-anchored district. First-time candidate May Nivar — who still must win a Democratic primary — hopes to take on Del. David Owen, R-Henrico. Anderson, from  District 71, hopes that this time she can topple Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County. 
Anderson lost by one percentage point in 2023, and this time has more investment from party organizers, she said. 
Countering this, Batten helped form an informal “purple caucus” to support fellow GOP candidates in competitive districts. 
“If any of us find some best practices or have some good ideas that we think would be useful, then we try to share those and collaborate with each other,” she recently told The Mercury. 
Republican groups are also boosting their male and female candidates in competitive districts where Democrats are vulnerable. A new series of advertisements from the Republican State Leadership Committee and Virginia House Republican Campaign Committee target delegates Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, Josh Cole, D- Fredericksburg, Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Josh Thomas, D-Prince William. 
Across all of 2023’s elections, just 975 votes ultimately determined which party landed the majority in the House — underscoring how each ballot cast could prove decisive this year. 
As excitement builds within Virginia, Jessica Taylor with Cook Political Report said she’s watching how national groups pour money into the gubernatorial election, which can help down-ballot candidates. 
Anderson said she thinks it’s “really cool” that there are so many women stepping up to lead Virginia’s government, especially the gubernatorial candidates, whom she acknowledged both have a momentous role to play, whatever the election’s outcome. 
“I want Spanberger to be our history-maker,” she said. “But, no matter where this goes, we’re making history.”

(Courtesy of Fluvanna County Public Schools)As the current superintendent of the Fluvanna County Public Schools and now in my 35th year as a Virginia educator, I have had the responsibility and privilege of impacting the education of countless students. I constantly strive to find creative ways to maximize our community’s resources as efficiently as possible. This can be especially challenging for smaller, rural communities where resources are limited.
I am proud of the bipartisan work our General Assembly has done to promote and make available a win-win solution to help address this resource challenge by reducing our energy costs 25%. Two bills, House Bill 1934 and Senate Bill 1192, passed the Virginia General Assembly this session with overwhelming bipartisan support. Both bills provide a way for schools to significantly reduce their electric bills with rooftop solar.  
Putting rooftop solar on our rural schools is cost-effective, pollution-free, and provides a locally-made source of power. Though largely untapped as a community-based solution, solar can be installed on schools much more quickly than a big power plant can be built to meet energy needs. It’s an immediate opportunity to equip school systems to maximize savings and   fund critical educational tools for Virginia’s students.
Solar for schools and nonprofits is under siege. Fortunately, there’s a simple fix.

Today, about 90 schools across more than 25 school divisions in the commonwealth have rooftop solar panels. This isn’t just a great idea  — it’s a working model spanning rural, suburban and urban communities. But we’re only scratching the surface of what we could — and should — be doing. With more than 2,250 public school buildings in Virginia, only 4% are currently benefiting from generating energy with solar arrays on their rooftops. The potential savings for Virginia’s schools is enormous! In Fluvanna, we’ve realized nearly 25% in actual energy cost savings since going solar in 2020. 
Once signed into law, these bills will unlock that potential for all communities. The legislation prioritizes public schools that invest in solar by providing them with the opportunity to sell the renewable credits that their solar facilities produce. The sale of renewable credits makes these smaller, rooftop solar installations on schools more economically viable, enabling districts like ours to move forward with projects that would otherwise sit just out of reach.
The benefits are impossible to overstate. Solar on schools equals dollars for schools and savings for communities. That’s money that can be put directly back into classrooms supporting teachers, updating instructional resources, expanding programs and modernizing technology to give our kids what they need to succeed. These are long-term savings that will benefit generations of students while easing the burden on taxpayers.
Solar also offers significant advantages in energy planning and reliability. Virginia’s energy demand is projected to grow by at least 5% each year in the Dominion Energy service territory. We need every tool available to meet that growth responsibly, and schools are perfectly positioned to be part of the solution. Rooftop solar allows schools to become energy producers, helping to stabilize the grid and reduce energy burdens.
Solar on schools strengthens resiliency. Many schools serve as community shelters during storms and emergencies. Equipping them with solar panels will enhance their ability to function when the grid goes down. It’s not just about cost savings; it’s about preparedness and crisis response.
Solar projects on schools offer great learning potential, too. Solar installations present a dynamic lab opportunity where students can learn about energy, sustainability and environmental stewardship in real time. These systems can be integrated into science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) curricula, sparking interest in high-demand energy careers and helping build a workforce ready for Virginia’s economy.
Virginia is on the path to an affordable, sustainable energy future that uses every energy lever at our disposal. Prioritizing solar installations for schools through HB 1934 and SB 1192 ensures Virginia stays on that path. It supports our schools, our students, and our state’s economy. Virginia’s public schools are ready to do their part, and the governor’s signature on these bills would make it all possible.

,DC,2025-04-23 09:10:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/poll-belief-false-measles-claims-correlated-lower-vaccination-rates,,"WASHINGTON — Americans are increasingly unsure what to believe about measles as an outbreak spreads throughout the country, according to a survey released Wednesday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.The poll shows that nearly a quarter of those asked believe a commonly repeated false claim that getting a child vaccinated against measles could lead to autism. About the same percentage of those surveyed believe it’s either definitely or probably true that vitamin A can prevent someone from contracting measles, even though it cannot.And 19% of those surveyed believed untrue statements that the vaccine for measles is more dangerous than contracting the virus.Parents who believed at least one of the three incorrect claims were more likely to have delayed or skipped some vaccinations for their children. Nearly a quarter, 24%, of those surveyed said they haven’t protected their children via vaccination, more than double the 11% of parents who responded that all three of the false statements about measles were definitely or probably untrue.Ongoing outbreakThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as of late last week there are more than 800 measles diagnoses throughout at least 25 states.The infections are spread throughout different age groups with 31% of cases in children under five years old, 38% of diagnoses in those between five and 19 years old, 29% in people above the age of 20 and 2% in those with an unknown age, according to the CDC.Eighty-five patients have been hospitalized and three have died. Nearly all of the confirmed cases, 96%, are in people who have not received the MMR vaccine or who are unsure about their vaccination status, according to the CDC.States with confirmed cases include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.Virginia reported its first case this year over the weekend, though that’s not yet included on the CDC’s website about the ongoing outbreak.Understanding linked with concernKFF’s survey shows that even though there are many people who believe untrue claims about measles or the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — there are higher percentages of people who understand basic facts about the virus and who are concerned about the ongoing outbreak.Seventy-five percent of those polled said it was incorrect that the MMR vaccine leads to autism, 81% responded it was wrong to say the vaccine is more dangerous than contracting the virus and 75% said it was false that vitamin A can prevent someone from getting measles.About half, or 51%, of those surveyed said they are at least somewhat concerned about the spread of measles. That worry was highest among Hispanic adults, 62%, and Black adults, 61%.Most of the people surveyed, 56%, knew that the spread of measles was higher this year than during prior years, though that number varied among people of different political leanings.Seventy-one percent of Democrats knew that diagnoses of measles have spiked in recent months, compared with 54% of independents and 49% of Republicans.KFF conducted the survey of 1,380 adults between April 8 and April 15 via telephone and online questions.",,,,2025-04-23 05:59:26.303250

(Courtesy photos) A federal appeals court ordered the State Board of Elections not to send information to overseas or military absentee voters about providing photo ID, granting a stay that Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs requested. It’s the latest development in the nearly six-month-old dispute over last November’s election for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court.
Federal District Judge Richard Myers II told the Board of Elections earlier this month to prepare to act on the state high court’s instructions to notify some military and overseas absentee voters they need to supply photo ID for their votes in last fall’s election for a seat on the high court to count. 
Tuesday’s  2-1 Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals order stops that action before Myers makes a decision on Riggs’ request for a preliminary injunction. 
The state Supreme Court agreed with GOP Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin that military and overseas absentee voters in certain counties should have had to provide photo ID when they cast ballots in last fall’s election. 
Griffin is trying to unseat Riggs, an incumbent Democrat on the Supreme Court. He trails by 734 votes. In an attempt to win, he wants thousands of votes in the race erased. He is challenging overseas and military voters in a handful of counties. The Supreme Court rejected Griffin’s attempt to throw out more than 60,000 votes based on his claim of incomplete voter registrations. 
The Supreme Court said overseas and military voters would have 30 days to “cure” their ballots once the Board of Elections sent out notices. 
Riggs filed a federal appeal. Myers told the Board of Elections to get to work implementing the Supreme Court order, but to not certify a winner. 
Judges Paul V. Niemeyer, appointed by President George H.W. Bush, and Toby J. Heytens, appointed by President Joe Biden, decided to grant the stay. Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., appointed by President Donald Trump, dissented.

Getty Images.The University of Toledo is suspending nine undergraduate programs in response to a controversial new higher education law that is set to take effect this summer. 
Admission to Africana studies, Asian studies, data analytics, disability studies, Middle East studies, philosophy, religious studies, Spanish and women’s and gender studies programs has been suspended starting with the 2025-26 school year “in compliance with SB1”, according to a Monday news release from the university.

Students currently enrolled in one of the programs can still complete their degree and all nine of these programs will remain available as minors. 
“I also want to be clear that these disciplines remain an important part of UToledo,” Dr. Scott Molitor, Toledo’s interim provost and executive vice president of academic affairs, said in a written statement. “Faculty will continue to teach courses that are part of minors, certificates or concentrations, as well as significant components of our core curriculum.”
Senate Bill 1 bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, and eliminates undergraduate degree programs that produce on average less than five degrees annually over a three-year period, among other things.
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill at the end of January, it quickly passed both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law March 28. It affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, and is set to take effect at the end of June. Youngstown State University faculty are trying to get a referendum on the November ballot to block S.B. 1. 
UT was already undergoing an annual review of low-enrolled academic programs when DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law, according to the university. 
“At the same time UToledo was undergoing its program review process, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law Senate Bill 1, which includes language that requires universities to eliminate undergraduate programs that have conferred fewer than five degrees annually over any three-year period,” according to the university. 
‘Nothing speaks like money.’ Republican Senator wants Ohio higher education funds tied to new law

Those nine programs had 57 students majoring in them during the spring semester and 15 students graduated from those programs during the 2023-24 school year, according to the university.
Toledo is suspending 12 additional degree programs unrelated to S.B. 1. They are: 

Bachelor of Business Administration in Organizational Leadership and Management
Bachelor of Science in Health Information Administration
Master of Arts in Philosophy
Master of Arts in Sociology
Master of Education in Educational Research and Measurement
Master of Education in Educational Technology
Master of Education in Educational Psychology
Master of Music in Music Performance
Master of Science in Geology
Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Early Childhood
Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Educational Technology
Ph.D. in Foundations of Education: Research and Measurement

“It is important to keep our academic portfolio current with the degree programs our students want and that industry needs from their higher education partner,” Molitor said. “This is now our third year of an annual process to evaluate our programs and make sure we are allocating resources to areas in high demand, which requires us to both look for new programs we should start offering and existing programs that we should stop offering.”

This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th.  Meet Candice and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
President Donald Trump’s new administration has reignited conversations about the safety of judges, as threats and instances of violence against them increase annually. In the first three months of his second term, the president and his associates have singled out multiple federal judges by name, questioning both their credentials and calling for them to be impeached.
Women judges, including those who have experienced violent attacks first hand, are working to sound the alarm on solutions to better protect judges at all levels of government.
“In order to do our jobs, we have to feel safe,” Julie Kocurek, a Travis County district judge in Texas who survived a 2015 attack, told The 19th. “We have to be able to hold the rule of law and not feel fearful. It goes to the core of our legal system and our democracy.”
Kocurek declined to comment on the Trump administration specifically and wanted to keep the conversation nonpartisan. She added that she feels the climate of hate against judges has worsened over the last decade, which she attributes in part to social media emboldening people.
Ten years ago, Kocurek was shot and seriously injured in her home driveway while with her son. Her attacker was a defendant who had been charged with tax fraud.
“I had been a judge for 16 years and never imagined that something like this would happen,” Kocurek said. “I was in the hospital for 40 days. I almost died from an infection, and had 26 surgeries while I was in the hospital. My immediate family did not want me to go back to work at all. But, you know, I soon realized that this was not about me personally. It was about my work, and I had to go back to work to show that violence will not prevail over the law and judges cannot be intimidated.”
Since that time, Kocurek successfully advocated for a court security bill in Texas, testified before Congress and detailed her experiences in an interview with “48 Hours.” Kocurek isn’t the only one.
In the last several weeks, Esther Salas, a U.S. district court judge in New Jersey, has appeared on national news programs warning that public officials, including judges, are dealing with “unprecedented attacks in the form of intimidation.” In 2020, Salas’ 20-year-old son Daniel was fatally shot at their family home. The suspect was a lawyer who described himself as an “anti-feminist,” and had appeared before Salas in court concerning his lawsuit challenging the military’s male-only draft. He was later found dead.
This month, about a dozen pizzas delivered to other judges’ homes named Salas’ murdered son Daniel as the sender of the order.
“I’ve often talked about the violence against the judiciary being a barn fire that’s been burning for some time, but it feels like people in positions of power, leadership, people with large social platforms, are throwing fuel on this fire and lumber on this fire and accelerant,” Salas said in an interview last week with ABC News’ Linsey Davis. Salas’ office did not respond to interview requests from The 19th.
Violence against judges is not exclusive to women in the profession, and multiple men have been killed in connection with their positions in public office. Figures from the U.S. Marshals Service indicate that serious threats against federal judges more than doubled between the end of fiscal year 2021 and the end of fiscal year 2023. The agency’s 2024 annual report states that while the number and intensity of threats has increased, the number of investigations conducted into threats has decreased. The report did not explain why.
In response to a request from The 19th asking for a breakdown of gender differences in the number of threats, the agency’s office of public affairs stated it did not have any additional data to provide.
Despite the data gaps, Kocurek said that the information she has received over the years suggests that women judges are more vulnerable to violent attacks.
“Especially in the criminal courts, because we handle family violence cases, where it’s predominantly men assaulting their wives or their intimate partners,” Kocurek said. “They are only starting to collect that data, but the data is showing that, yes, it is happening more against women judges than men.”
Beyond the judiciary, data capturing instances of political violence against women in public office more broadly is also limited. It is a new area of research about “four to five years old,” said Nadia E. Brown, professor of government and chair of the women’s and gender studies program at Georgetown University. Brown said that in her research she finds that women in public office tend to view threats against them as one-offs rather than as a systemic pattern. Women also may not view more subtle threats against them under the umbrella of political violence, she added.
“My co-author, Paru Shah, and I have done around like 32 interviews with women of color mayors, and they’ve all said things like, ‘Well, I don’t consider this political violence,’ but then they’ve gone on to list some egregious, horrible things. Then, as they are talking to us about it, they’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, maybe that was political violence,’ You hear them processing this in real time,” Brown said.
Kocurek, Salas and others are identifying ways to address these issues.
On April 15, Salas participated in a virtual Zoom panel called Speak Up For Justice. She encouraged the thousands of legal professionals watching to join what she described as a “civics education movement” she said is being led by U.S. District Court Judges Landya B. McCafferty in New Hampshire, Beth Bloom in the Southern District of Florida and Robin L. Rosenberg, also in the Southern District of Florida.
Separately, the federal judiciary has created a task force that will consider how to address risks facing federal judges, according to reporting from The New York Times.
Following Kocurek’s attack in 2015, the Texas legislature passed a bipartisan court security bill signed by the governor in 2017. Kocurek said that her attack highlighted gaps in how security threats are reported, in data collection and in access to security personnel for judges.
Data collected as a result of the law showed that from 2018 to 2023 there were 522 general threats on judicial officers in Texas, 29 assaults and 68 bomb threats, Kocurek said. The law also prompted the state to create a court security division supported by a U.S. Marshal who helps judges with security assessments and best practices. In Michigan, a judicial security act is currently making its way through the legislature to ensure that state judges have the same protections currently provided to federal judges, including limits on the personal information publicly posted about them.
Last year in Congress, a bipartisan group of senators introduced the Countering Threats and Attacks on Our Judges Act that aims to establish an intelligence and resource center to monitor threats against state and local judges and court personnel, as well as provide technical assistance, training, physical security assessments and guidance on court security. The bill was passed by the U.S. Senate in June 2024, but stalled in the House.
Kocurek said that she is hopeful that this bill will be passed and signed this year.
“It’s kind of therapeutic, helping people, using my experience to help others,” Korcurek said. “It makes me feel like it didn’t happen for nothing, or like I’m doing something with it. I told my son from the beginning, ‘We are not going to let this define us. We will define our story and what this will be used for.’”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 05:59:26.303250

Liu is challenging a Trump administration move to cancel his record of immigration in an online database, on April 22, 2025. (Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)In January 2022, Xiaotian Liu, a Chinese student studying at Wake Forest University, ran into an immigration issue at the Detroit Airport.
After having returned home to China, Liu was attempting to re-enter the United States to continue his studies, when he encountered what he says was a clerical issue: His entry in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System was listed as inactive. Wake Forest confirmed via email Liu’s student immigration status was still valid, but U.S. Customs and Border Protection would not let him through.
The incident was quickly resolved. Liu returned to China, waited for the error to be corrected, and re-entered the U.S to continue his studies.
But three years later, Liu, now a Dartmouth computer science doctoral student, has had his immigration status thrown into uncertainty after the Trump administration terminated his record in the student immigration database without warning — one of hundreds of students in the U.S. to face a similar action. And the incident in Detroit, the government has suggested, might have served as the pretext. 
On Tuesday, Liu, who is suing the Department of Homeland Security to reinstate his record, received an extension of temporary relief Tuesday from a New Hampshire federal judge. But the larger questions over why his immigration status changed and what the Department of Homeland Security is intending to do in the future remain unanswered. 
Judge Samantha Elliott of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire extended her earlier temporary restraining order pausing the government’s actions against Liu. She said she would issue a larger ruling later this week on whether to grant a preliminary injunction against the government. And she expressed frustration with the Department of Homeland Security’s approach, at one point describing their arguments as “a bit Kafkaesque.” 
Liu was forced to stop his research work earlier this month after the federal government deleted an entry for him in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a digital database known as SEVIS. The database allows U.S. colleges and universities to update to the federal government whether their international students are complying with the terms of their study visa, but on April 4, Dartmouth sent Liu an email stating that he had been deleted from the system and that he could not continue his research until it was resolved. He quickly filed a lawsuit with the backing of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and Ron Abramson, an attorney with Shaheen & Gordon. 
Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security did not explain Tuesday why Liu’s database entry was deleted. Liu’s entry visa has not been revoked and his F-1 student status — which guarantees his right to stay — is still active, government lawyers stressed. But they would not detail the federal agency’s decision to delete him from the database, and would not say why the government would do so if it did not also intend to revoke his immigration status.
“What is the point of terminating Mr. Liu’s record?” Elliott asked. “What’s the point? Why terminate it?”
“It’s an action within the Homeland Security’s authority,” said Glenn Girdharry, assistant director of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
In an affidavit, Andre Watson, assistant director of the National Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security, recounted Liu’s 2022 encounter in Detroit and said it had prompted the record deletion this month. 
“On January 2, 2022, at a Port of Entry, seeking admission into the United States, Liu was found inadmissible under Section 212 of the Immigration and Nationality Act,” Watson wrote. “Based on LUI’s encounter with CBP, on April 4, 2025, SEVP set LIU’s SEVIS record to ‘terminated.’” 
But Watson did not clarify what about the 2022 encounter had led to the record being revoked.
In a series of interactions in court Tuesday, Elliott attempted to get an explanation from the government as to why the record was deleted if Liu’s immigration status was intact. 
“At the risk of being flip, silly me, I believed that the government would want the record to accurately reflect and manifest the status,” Elliott said. “But what I’m hearing from your papers and your argument is that that’s not necessarily the case.”
Girdharry answered only that the Department of Homeland Security has been given the power by Congress to “develop and conduct” the SEVIS database, and that it was acting lawfully when it terminated Liu’s record. 
He repeated that Liu’s student status is not at threat currently. “Plaintiffs are asserting that the status has been terminated here,” he said. “The government says it has not been terminated. If that’s the challenge before this court, that is not a proper challenge.” 
Girdharry also suggested that Liu could always apply for a reinstatement of his F-1 student immigration should it be terminated. 
“Are you suggesting that he could apply for reinstatement of status notwithstanding the government’s argument that his status is not” affected to begin with? Elliott asked. Girdharry said yes. 
“A bit Kafkaesque,” Elliott replied. 
And Girdharry argued the lawsuit was invalid because the entity preventing Liu from continuing his studies is Dartmouth College, not the Department of Homeland Security. It is up to Dartmouth, not the government, whether to allow Liu to continue doing his research, especially because Liu still has a valid visa and F-1 immigration status, Girdharry said. 
“Any determination that he cannot do those things is not a determination of ICE, that’s a determination from the school,” Girdharry said. 
But lawyers for Liu countered that the deletion of the SEVIS record did have consequences for Liu and that the government was directly responsible for them.
To start, SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire, noted that a page on the DHS’s website suggested that a student whose SEVIS record is terminated must not be allowed to continue their research or be paid for it. Girdharry countered that the website is only guidance and that it likely applies to students whose SEVIS record and immigration status is terminated, when Liu’s immigration remains intact. 
But Kim said that guidance had already led Dartmouth College to block Liu’s studies, and that that had resulted in direct harm. Liu would be unable to continue his studies if his record were not reinstated, and would lose “all that makes life worth living,” they argued. 
At the press conference Tuesday, Gilles Bissonnette, ACLU of New Hampshire legal director, said he did not accept the government’s arguments that the SEVIS record termination does not affect Liu’s immigration status. Without that SEVIS record intact, it is difficult for Dartmouth to confirm whether Liu does still have his status, Bissonnette said. 
“The government of course suggested today that he has status,” Bissonnette said. “It’s not reflected in any affidavit (or) affirmative statement that our client has status. Not reflected in any affidavit before this court. (There’s) a failure to even stipulate that that’s the reality.” 
“As an international student, I have felt welcomed into the Dartmouth community for almost two years now, and in the United States for almost nine years,” Liu said in a press conference Tuesday following that court hearing. “It is, of course, scary to even consider that my research and my study here at Dartmouth may be suspended, but it is my hope that I can continue my research and complete my Ph.D. here at Dartmouth.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Xiaotian-Liu-press-conference-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-04-23 05:59:26.303250

“This is one of the largest affordable housing investments we’ve made in a single year,” said Wake County Commissioner Safiyah Jackson. “We know housing is the foundation for health, safety and economic opportunity. When investing in our own neighbors, the seniors, working families and individuals who live right here in Wake County, we’re strengthening our entire community.”
The 644 homes will exceed Wake County’s goal to create and preserve 500 units annually. The funding comes through Wake County’s 2025 Affordable Housing Development Program, which supports both Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and non-tax credit projects.
A mix of federal and local dollars will support the following developments:

Heritage Park Senior Phase IB (Raleigh) — $500,000
The Canopy (Cary) — $655.000
Abbey Spring (Apex) — $1.47 million
Fisher Grove (Raleigh) — $3.3 million
Chapanoke (Raleigh) — $7.1 million
Biltmore Hills (Raleigh) — $1.4 million
Friendship Station (Apex) — $480,000
Grosvenor Gardens (Raleigh) — $2.6 million

Wake County selected the top-ranked proposals through an evaluation process that considers criteria including ability to serve residents at the lowest income levels, long-term affordability and overall quality and feasibility.
Of the funded units:

208 homes will serve households making 50% or less of the area median income, or $61,150 a year for a family of four.
94 homes will serve households at 30% or less of the area median income, or $36,690 a year for a family of four.
Most developments will remain affordable for 50 years or more.

Projects receiving funding will submit final applications for tax credits to the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency in May, with award announcements in August 2025.
Wake County is projected to need 110,689 new homes to meet demand by 2029, according to a recent report commissioned by the NC Chamber Foundation in partnership with the North Carolina Home Builders Association and NC REALTORS.
Meanwhile, North Carolina is facing a five-year housing inventory gap of 764,478 units (322,360 rental units and 442,118 for-sale units).
Across the nation, there is estimated shortage of approximately 3.8 million to 7.2 million homes. Housing experts say the shortage stems from a combination of factors, including population growth, limited new construction and stricter land-use regulations.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_4253-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-23 05:59:26.303250

(Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)More states are enacting bans on “Glock switches,” small devices about the size of a U.S. quarter that can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.
Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices, but the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”
Recovered at crime scenes
The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.

The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.

Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
More law enforcement agencies reconsider use of popular Sig Sauer P320 handgun

In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department. The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”
Alabama and New Mexico
Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Democratic state Rep. Phil Ensler, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.










This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– Democratic Alabama state Rep. Phil Ensler


According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.
New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.
Red flag laws are increasingly being used to protect gun owners in crisis

“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.
Lawsuits against Glock
Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

(Courtesy of Ana Hebra Flaster)There are approximately 63,000 Latinos living in New Hampshire today, just under 5% of the population. But when we arrived as political refugees fleeing the Cuban revolution in December 1967, Latinos were hard to find, Cubans in particular. If we heard someone speaking Spanish at the grocery store, we ran in their direction and dragged them back to the house for a cafecito.  
How we ended up in Nu Hamcher, rather than Miami or New Jersey, where so many Cuban refugees had settled by then, is an odd yet typical immigrant tale. That we ended up here turned out to be gift, a stroke of luck that delivered us into a community where we would thrive and remain for five decades and counting. My new memoir, “Property of the Revolution: From a Cuban Barrio to a New Hampshire Mill Town” celebrates our immigrant journey, the strength required to uproot yourself from one world and persevere in a foreign land. Luckily, for us that was Nu Hamcher.

Like many immigrants, we followed the trail blazed by another family from home. That family, two parents and six children, neighbors from our Havana barrio, had been sponsored at a refugee processing center by a Baptist church in New Hampshire a few years earlier. When they heard through the Cuban grapevine that we’d made it out, they found us and encouraged us to come north. Lots of good factory jobs — they said — good schools, room for the kids to play, and nice people. The snow is a problem, though. And it was. The day after we arrived a blizzard dropped 18 inches of snow on Nashua, terrifying the adults and thrilling us kids.
For my parents, grandmother, and aunt and uncle, New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die felt more like a prayer than a motto. Our working-class family had just faced that moral dilemma in Cuba and had found another option — an excruciating one for a multigenerational family that lived doors away from each other. They would flee the revolution that had flipped Cuba the hell over.
Like most Cubans, the viejos, elders, had initially supported the 1959 revolution. Fidel Castro had denied any communist ties, promised free elections, and the restoration of Cuba’s 1940 democratic constitution. Instead, he ushered in a military dictatorship that turned out to be more brutal than Batista’s.
Life stopped being about living; it became about politics and proving your revolutionary fervor at work, in school, on the street. Neighbor denounced neighbor. Depuraciones, cleansings, became routine, instructing wayward revolutionaries to return to the fold by “volunteering,” working harder, sacrificing more, demonstrating their loyalty to Fidel and la patria, homeland. Food disappeared from shelves. Ration cards were issued. For the first time in the republic’s history, Cubans needed permisos, exit visas, to leave the island.
Gusanos, worms, the government’s term for people like us who opposed the revolution, were persecuted with impunity. They lost their jobs, were expelled from schools, faced angry mobs outside their homes, lived in fear.
The viejos had found a snowy haven from that political storm. Not only was New Hampshire’s motto spot on, they felt safer knowing the Canadian border was just a short drive away. If America erupted into violence and revolution, they’d be able to escape quickly. 
And a revolution looked imminent in late 1967. Vietnam War protestors seemed to revere Fidel and Che Guevara, were evidently unfazed by the lack of free speech in Cuba they would never tolerate here, and silent about the extrajudicial executions still underway back home. Many said they were Marxist-Leninists. And America’s longstanding racism had sparked race riots across the country and a Black political movement that proposed revolution as the solution. 
The months after we arrived brought us the Tet Offensive, increasing political unrest, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy. The viejos watched Walter Cronkite warily and came up with their own motto: keep the Studebaker’s tank full.
But we’d been lucky so far. Maybe it would hold. After years of waiting for their exit papers — without jobs, jobs were for revolutionaries, not gusanos — the regime had granted eight members of our family exit visas. We’d flown to the U.S. on one of the Johnson administration’s Freedom Flights, the largest refugee airlift in American history. Two Pan American flights a day flew almost 300,000 Cubans to new lives in the U.S. from 1965 to 1973. My father’s nightmare of having to put us on a boat and head to sea had not come true.
Gusanos of our era knew they’d have to leave everything behind. We could take only a change of clothes for each member of the family when we left. Our family of factory workers never had much material wealth. The true cost of leaving was breaking four generations of our family apart, knowing we’d never be able to return, that they’d probably never get out. That we’d never see them again.
But we were free. We lived in Libertad now. We were making our way at work, at school. We faced some racism and bigotry, but the overwhelming majority of Nashuans were curious about us, friendly, helpful. 
A man named Ray Flanders let us rent a house he owned without putting down a deposit. He was a foreman at the rubber boot factory and offered jobs to all the adults. “Pay me the rent after you get your first paychecks,” he said. The four viejos were working the assembly lines in no time. 
One of their co-workers, Terri, taught my mother how to drive and filled the house with laughter each time she visited. Another co-worker, Thelma, took us on epic outings to the White Mountains and showed us how to roast marshmallows and swim in freezing water. Thelma usually let me ride in her blue Volkswagen Bug, a Cuban caravan trailing behind us.
When the Studebaker my father had borrowed from the other Cuban family broke, he couldn’t afford to pay the mechanic’s bill. Peter, a first-generation Lithuanian immigrant, told him not to worry. “Pay me something each month. We’ll get there.” And they did. 
We made our way, too. My grandmother held the household together while the adults worked at different factories. My aunt, who’d snuck her Ph.D. diploma out of Cuba in the lining of her bra, was soon teaching Spanish at Nashua High School, where she taught for 30 years. My mother landed a job at a small CVS on Main Street and, about five years later, became the manager of the massive CVS at the Nashua Mall. We kids held our own at school, in the town band, and in sports.
After three years, the viejos had saved enough to buy a yellow duplex on Hunt Street. The house filled with Cubans of all ages, our family and the handful of Cuban families who joined us in Nashua. There were two dogs, the hundred or so canaries my father bred in a basement aviary, Cuban music — thanks to the records our relatives brought us from Miami — and americanitos who liked the mayhem. Abuela’s pressure cooker rattled on the stove every day and she rattled with it, warning us in stressed-out Spanish it would explode if we kept running in the kitchen.
But becoming Cuban American wasn’t easy. The viejos ached for their own viejos, still in Cuba, amid growing misery and isolation. We all faced our share of racism and bigotry, especially my father at his factory jobs. But my aunt encouraged us to feel sorry for the seborucos, blockheads, who were so ignorant they didn’t understand how amazing Cubans were, our history, literature, music. Focus on the good Americans. There are plenty. 
We’re in a different world today. For people like us, who benefited from our timing as refugees — fleeing a communist dictatorship in the middle of the Cold War — and were generally welcomed, this administration’s anti-immigrant policies fill us with both gratitude for what we were spared and refugee guilt for what newcomers face. There but for the grace of U.S. immigration law go we.
We need orderly and humane immigration policies. We lost control of our borders for too many years. But what’s happening now is sweeping up the innocent with the guilty.
Former Cuban political prisoners, dissidents, and activists who came to the U.S. in recent years legally, through a temporary parole program, have been deported to Cuba. Tens of thousands of Cubans — and Haitian, Venezuelan, and Nicaraguan — parolees are still facing imminent, sweeping deportations.
The plight of immigrants today makes me even more grateful for the New Hampshire welcome we received 58 years ago. I believe most Americans are more than capable of that welcome. Some may not know it. But when they meet an immigrant family, live near them, work with them, see them as a mother, father, grandmother, and children — just like theirs — I believe New Hampshire’s Rays, Terries, Thelmas, and Peters will surface in them, and show them the way.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/anacolumn-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-23 05:01:07.898536

The court is taking up a challenge to a First District Appeals Court decision in […],"The Gavel outside the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio, September 20, 2023, at 65 S. Front Street, Columbus, Ohio. (Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)The Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a case that centers around whether a same-sex couple shares parenting rights to children born through artificial insemination while they were in a relationship in the same way a heterosexual couple would.
The court is taking up a challenge to a First District Appeals Court decision in which the appellate court ordered a legal “would-have-been-married” test to decide whether things would have been different if the couple’s potential marriage had been recognized in Ohio.
Priya Shahani and Carmen Edmonds were in an 11-year relationship, and three kids carried the hyphenated last names of the two when they were together. Attorneys say marriage was discussed, Edmonds’ lawyer said she proposed and Shahani said yes. But a trip to Boston that could have ended in marriage did not, and their home state didn’t recognize same-sex marriage. Ohio also doesn’t recognize common-law marriages that occurred after 1991.
The U.S. Supreme Court decision in the 2015 Obergefell decision legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, and it required all states to them regardless of where they were performed. But it came after the couple went to Boston, and Shahani and Edmonds were never legally married.
When their relationship ended, however, they entered into a shared custody agreement for the three children, an agreement that is in dispute by the couple. The hyphenated names for the children were removed by Shahani after the agreement was already in place.
Attorneys want the Ohio Supreme Court to decide whether to apply parental rights to Edmonds in a way that presumes the couple would have been married had it been legal.

Paul Kerridge, attorney for Shahani, called the “would-have-been-married” standard proposed by the appellate court “unworkably speculative,” with the potential to cause a ripple effect in the legal world “because every part, every factor in that standard, would also apply to relationships that didn’t include marriage.”
“Really what the First District did here is create common-law marriage without saying that there was a creation of common-law marriage, and creating an exception to a statute without ever saying that’s what they were doing,” Kerridge told the court on Tuesday.
Obergefell recognizes marriages and allows that same-sex couples should have access to the full “constellation” of rights under marriage, including parental rights. But does not extend that right to unmarried couples, Kerridge argued.
“Marriages have licenses and they have signatures, and it’s a known entity of what kind of relationship and the change in your personal rights and obligations, that’s a known entity that you’re entering into,” he said.
While the case is based on a custody battle, Edmonds’ attorney, Jonathan L. Hilton, called custody “a poor-man’s version of parentage.”
He said Edmonds struggles to obtain medical records or school records for the children she once shared with Shahani, and didn’t receive notice or have legal standing when her last name was removed from the children’s surnames.
“So you have children who have hyphenated names — their very identity — being changed, and my client has no more rights in that situation than a babysitter,” Hilton said.
The shared custody agreement allows Edmonds to see the kids about 30% of the time, Hilton said. But if a partner of Shahani wanted to enter into the adoption process for the children, Edmonds would have limited rights.
Justices went back and forth with the attorneys about whether Obergefell applied to two people who never were legally married, and whether the shared custody agreement was equivalent to a marriage document in terms of giving parental rights.
“It seems like you’re advocating for a really impossible standard,” Justice Patrick DeWine said to Hilton. “You have one parent who says ‘I wouldn’t have got married,’ you’ve got one parent who says ‘I would’ve gotten married.’ How can a court really sort that out? Because no one actually knows what someone would have done, and if they would have been married, the rights would have been different.”
Justice Jennifer Brunner pointed to the history of the Obergefell case, in which Ohioan Jim Obergefell’s husband was terminally ill, and the two got married on a Maryland tarmac before flying back to Ohio, even though it was not recognized in their state.
“There was that issue of consent there, that both parties wanted it regardless,” Brunner said. “And what proof do we have of that consent to marry when they didn’t get married?”
Hilton argues the children’s hyphenated names, the shared custody agreement, and the engagement prove a plan was in place for Edmonds and Shahani.
“We have (Shahani’s) consent here to shared parentage, and the only way that they could’ve gotten shared parentage would be to have this kind of union,” Hilton said.
Justice Patrick Fischer pushed back, saying the supreme court was not facing a question on the custody agreement, but rather on whether parental rights should extend despite the lack of a marriage license.
“If the shared custody agreement continues, as a matter of fact, I know as a matter of law there may be a difference, but as a matter of fact, day-to-day, for the best interests of the children, anything we decide here doesn’t change a thing,” Fischer said.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Early voting is underway in this year’s May 6 primary election. An odd-year election on the heels of a presidential race doesn’t generate a lot of attention, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t important questions on the ballot. Around Ohio, voters will weigh in on local races for township trustee, city council, and mayor, as well as tax levies and liquor options.
Additionally, voters will decide whether to allow to the state to borrow $2.5 billion to fund public infrastructure.
State Capital Improvement Program
The ballot measure, known as Issue 2, is not controversial. It funds the State Capital Improvement Program which has been around since the 1980s. Money borrowed by the state helps cover municipal projects like roads, bridges, and sewers. The idea goes back before voters every 10 years to renew state authority to issue bonds. Three renewals have been approved.
If voters do so again, the state will borrow money — in this case $2.5 billion — and task the Ohio Public Works Commission with funding local projects. The commission hands out grants and no-interest loans through a competitive process.
The program is popular and bipartisan. Lawmakers from both chambers and both parties drafted the argument in favor of the issue.
“Every Ohio county has benefited from this program,” the group wrote, “which has produced more than 19,000 grants and loans for essential, locally selected projects.”

They added that projects funded through the program create construction work and don’t increase taxes.
In committee testimony, Clermont County Commissioner David Painter explained the funding process “encourages deliberation, compromise, and the development of a regional perspective on infrastructure needs.” He noted his own four-county district received $14 million in the last ten-year funding round.
“Without state support, it would be much more difficult, and sometimes impossible, for local governments to undertake these projects.”
No one spoke against the measure, so the state ballot board had to write the argument against Issue 2.
Nuts and bolts
Early voting is available every weekday from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm this week and from 7:30 am to at least 7:30 pm next week as well. Voters who want to cast a ballot early will also be able to do so the following weekend, May 3 and 4.
If you’d rather vote by mail, there’s still time to request a ballot. They must be in by April 29. Ballots returned by mail must be postmarked by May 5, and have to be received at the board by May 10.
Looking around the Ohio, several big city mayors are up for reelection this year.
In Cleveland, Mayor Justin Bibb is seeking a second term, but the primary isn’t until September. In Dayton, Mayor Jeffrey Mims, Jr. won’t appear on the primary ballot because he has only one challenger, City Commissioner Shenise Turner-Sloss. They’ll face off in November.
Cincinnati and Toledo, however, will see the incumbents go before voters in the primary. In both cases, the mayors have drawn multiple challengers in a nonpartisan race. The primary will whittle the field ahead of November’s general election.
Cincinnati’s Aftab Pureval, a Democrat, is running against Cory Bowman and Brian Frank, both Republicans. Bowman is a local pastor and half-brother of Vice President J.D. Vance, and Frank is a Navy vet who spent more than two decades working for Procter & Gamble.
In Toledo, Democrat Wade Kapszukiewicz is running for a third term after the city approved a charter amendment extending mayoral term limits. He’s facing independent candidates Roberto Torres, who served on the staff of two previous mayoral administrations, and Harold Harris, a community activist and Air Force veteran.
Columbus has several people running for school board and a three-way race for a city council seat, but no mayoral election. Incumbent Andrew Ginther’s term runs through 2027.

(Photo by Troy Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Driven by increasing reports of student misbehavior, some teachers and administrators want to make it easier for staff to physically restrain students, a practice which is only supposed to be used in emergency situations under current state law.
Most states have some limitations on when schools can use restraints and seclusion, temporarily immobilizing students and putting them in empty rooms until they can calm down. 
Before Maine passed its current law in 2021, the state was restraining students at the highest rate in the country per capita, and secluding them at the second highest rate per capita, according to federal data cited by Disability Rights Maine at the time.
These incidents disproportionately involved students with disabilities, leading disability rights advocates to push for the current law, which requires school staff to justify the use of restraint, only rely on them in cases where there was “imminent danger of serious physical injury,” use the least amount of force necessary and end interventions as soon as the danger has passed. 
But in light of increasing behavioral challenges, some administrators and teachers want the lower the legal threshold for restraint and seclusion. On Wednesday, the Maine Legislature’s Education and Cultural Affairs Committee is holding a public hearing on legislation, introduced by Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York), that would make several changes to state law.
Specifically, the proposal would broaden the definition of “physical escort,” striking the word “voluntary” from descriptions of how staff can move or touch a student. The bill, LD 1248, would also decrease the level of danger posed from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Restraint and seclusion practices across the country have been linked to trauma, serious injuries, and even death. Disability rights advocates are warning that any changes must prioritize student safety and mental health, and that the use of restraint and seclusion generally goes against both.
Before the law was passed, schools would sometimes drag students to seclusion rooms without classifying the action as a restraint, said Ben Jones, a former lawyer for Disability Rights Maine who now serves as director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a nonprofit that advocates against punitive, exclusionary disciplinary practices in schools.
Research suggests state not doing enough to help Maine districts manage student behavior

The push for relaxing the rules is coming from districts like MSAD 11 in Gardiner, where administrators say frequent behavioral incidents, especially among younger students, have left them without the tools to respond. 
Principal Victoria Duguay of River View Community School said that under the current law, educators aren’t allowed to escort students to safe spaces unless they consent — something that doesn’t always happen in the midst of a behavioral crisis.
“When a student is dysregulated to the point where they’re clearing a classroom and potentially shutting a building down, we didn’t have any tools available to escort a student to a safe room if the student didn’t want to go on their own,” Duguay said. 
She also pointed to the aspect of current law that requires a threat of “serious physical injury.”
“Not having that ability to be able to get that child to a safe place is that piece in the law that we’re struggling with, because they’re not presenting that serious physical harm,” she said.
Attorneys consulted by the district said that because most of the third to fifth graders the community school serves are young, they do not present a serious risk of injury to adults even when they lash out. 
Because of educator feedback, Maine’s largest teachers union, the Maine Education Association, is supporting this legislation, along with a few other bills intended to offer de-escalation training and mental health support in schools, said MEA President Jesse Hargrove.
“We want to make sure that we are following least restrictive interventions, but we also want to make sure that other students and staff are safe,” he said.
“The state law is an effort to sort of create some space so that the folks at the local level have a bit more flexibility to address the concerns that they are seeing within their districts and school sites.”
When asked if they are worried about the use of restraints increasing under a more relaxed law, MEA and Gardiner administrators, Duguay and Superintendent Patricia Hopkins, said they trusted educators to use the least restrictive processes possible.
However, Atlee Reilly, managing attorney of Disability Rights Maine’s educational advocacy, said he’s concerned about the potential impacts of the bill. For example, because the proposal would remove the word “voluntary” from the text that covers how a student could be physically moved, the law would no longer count involuntary movements as a restraint. 
Reilly argued that while the number of reported incidents would likely decrease, that “doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.” He added, “I think that is almost certainly going to go up.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A group of Youngstown State University faculty who are trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop a controversial higher education law from taking effect completed a major first step. 
Members of the Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association submitted 4,500 signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and a petition summary to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost Monday. The first step to getting a referendum on the ballot is to get an initial written petition signed by 1,000 registered Ohio voters. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
LaRose must verify the number of valid signatures within 10 business days of receiving the petition. Yost must also certify if he believes the petition summary is a “fair and truthful statement” of the law.
The referendum is an attempt to stop Ohio Senate Bill 1 from going into effect, which is set to become law at the end of June. 
S.B. 1 bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges. 
A referendum petition can be filed before the law takes effect and the legislation would be paused. 
S.B. 1 moved quickly through the legislature, but there was much opposition from college students, faculty, and staff. State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill on Jan. 22, it passed in both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law March 28.  
“S.B. 1 is yet another nail in the coffins of unions and freedom of speech in Ohio,” YSU-OEA President Mark Vopat said in a statement. “This is a watered-down federal approach to D.E.I. that leaves universities vulnerable because there is no clear guidance on ‘controversial topics,’ while it also attacks union rights. We expect that other public unions will be next.”
What are the next steps in the referendum process?  
If LaRose and Yost approve the signatures and summary, then the signature gathering to get the referendum on the ballot begins. 
The petitioners would need about 248,092 signatures — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. The signatures would likely be due at the end of June. 
It would then be up to LaRose to verify the signatures. If it passes those hurdles, the referendum would be referred to the Ohio Ballot Board to determine the language that would appear on the November ballot. 
The last time a referendum passed in Ohio was 2011 when voters overturned an anti-collective bargaining law.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio teachers’ pension fund board has voted to increase the money in the monthly checks given to their retirees, as well as reduce the number of years active educators need to work before retiring with full benefits.
With the cost of everyday essentials going up, every dollar counts.
“We’re all trying to keep up with inflation, right?” retired educator Melissa Cropper, who is also the president of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, said.
The education system’s retirees will get some relief this summer.
Cropper cheered that the majority of the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board voted to increase the cost-of-living adjustments, or COLA, from 1% to 1.5% for eligible pensioners.
“Having a COLA means that there’s more money in your pockets to be able to keep up with inflation, when paying your everyday bills, buying your everyday groceries, all those types of things,” she said. “It’s a move in the right direction.”
Due to a new funding policy adopted in 2024, roughly $2 billion was able to be allotted under the board’s sustainable benefit plan.
In a board meeting last week, the board’s advisor informed them of the available money, but also explained how a temporary option could include a future increase in retirement eligibility requirements.
Former STRS Chief Actuary Brian Grinnell, who handled risk management, warned that this could put the nearly $100 billion fund in jeopardy.
“They’ve gone ahead and committed to spending this $2 billion on enhanced short-term benefits, and they’re doing this in the face of financial markets that are looking very, very challenging for this year,” Grinnell said.
Since January, the state’s pension funds have lost a significant amount of money due to the volatility in the global economy, he said.
He doesn’t trust the STRS board to handle this situation carefully.
“It’s reasonable to question how much faith you should put in this board at this point in time,” he said.
For the past year, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside STRS, which is the fund for more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
Attorney General Dave Yost is currently suing to remove the board chair for allegedly colluding with an investment firm startup attempting to “contract steer” billions in a scheme that would benefit him.
“I don’t think this board has inspired a lot of confidence that they are thinking about the long term and are taking their fiduciary responsibilities to all of the pension members seriously,” Grinnell continued.
He also argued that this move by the board won’t truly benefit educators, since it only gives an additional $50 per month for each retiree.
“There needs to be a COLA for these retirees in some form,” he said. “That COLA needs to be funded, though.”
The board is setting a precedent of raising benefits while losing money, he said, which will actually hurt the majority of the pensioners.
“There is an imbalance where the funding to pay the retiree benefits is, in part, coming at the expense of the active teachers,” he said.
Cropper argued that the active teachers are getting a fair deal, since the board also voted to reduce the number of years to get full retirement benefits from 33 to 32.
“We have board members who are looking to still keep the system stable, but to find a way that they can restore benefits among both actives and retirees, so that they’re equally sharing the loss and equally sharing the gain in this process,” she said.
The STRS board is also trying to lobby the state lawmakers to increase the contribution rates from employers.
But with the controversy, and with the board’s choices lately, several Republican legislative leaders say they don’t trust the board to use the proposed additional money wisely.
“I think that the state needs to make sure that the funds are valid or sustainable and that they’re not just blowing money — if there’s any indication that they’re making bad decisions right now,” Ohio Senate Education Chair Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware, said.
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, is the chair of the Ohio Retirement Study Council, and doesn’t think any request to the legislature will be fruitful.
“I feel pretty confident in saying that an employer contribution rate doesn’t have any support in the General Assembly — or enough support,” Bird said.
He continues to monitor the STRS situation closely, he added.
“I think it’s important for my colleagues and I to remember that we established a pension system and we are in charge of it — and if we decide there needs to be changes, as a body, we should make changes,” Bird said. “I think it’s important for the General Assembly to always keep a close eye on what the five pension systems are doing.”
In previous reports, Brenner and other Statehouse leaders suggested changing the STRS board structure.
Asked whether he has any interest in reforming the pension systems and how they function as a board, Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said in March, “The short answer to that question is yes.”
He proceeded to explain that the G.A. did pension reform in the early 2010s, and it is likely the time for another fix.
“The question is, are the folks who are serving on those boards, are they truly experts in pensions?” Huffman said. “I think those are all things that need to be reviewed on those five pension boards.”
Asked if he was looking at changing the STRS board, Bird responded, “No comment.”
Previously, the state’s other pension funds rejected any change within their structure. Officers within the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (OP&F) told the lawmakers to leave them out of STRS’ chaos.

Renee Erickson chats on the Senate floor during the April 10, 2025, veto session. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Since the 1980s, the Kansas Open Records Act has mandated that all public agencies, including the Legislature, produce public records either within three business days or “as soon as possible” in response to requests for records.
But the current Legislature seems to believe those words mean “whenever we feel like it.”
And for almost 20 years, KORA has allowed public agencies to redact information from public records that, if disclosed, would amount to a “clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Such information includes Social Security numbers, dates of birth or other information that could enable identify theft.
But this iteration of the Legislature seems to think it is entitled to redact information that could traditionally be found in a phonebook, and that it may do so in a futile attempt to shield the identity of a handful of powerful Kansans but not the rest of us.
Isn’t it time the Legislature follows its own laws for the benefit of everyone and not just a select few?
 
Rule of law shudders
Wichita Sen. Renee Erickson, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency and a member of the Republican supermajority, viewed timely KORA compliance as optional this legislative session when she was faced the prospect of disclosing information submitted to the supermajority’s online “government efficiency portal.”
The portal itself makes clear that “submissions are public records that are subject to the Kansas Open Records Act.” But when Kansas Reflector made a KORA request in February for submissions to the portal, Erickson said the Reflector would have to wait, not three business days, but rather two months for a response.
Such a long timeline could, potentially, be permissible under KORA if Erickson had offered a “detailed explanation of the cause for further delay,” as the law requires.
But by Erickson’s own admission, the delay was necessitated not by the Legislature’s inability to produce the records in a timely way, but because it preferred not to. In response to Reflector’s request on March 7, Erickson wrote that the requested submissions should be kept under wraps until May 1 because they were to be discussed “during meetings to be called during the 2025 interim” before next session “as a basis for possible legislation to be considered during the 2026 legislative session.”
Erickson would later amend the timeline, indicating that the records would be disclosed April 9. But Erickson proved even that date was not “as soon as possible,” as she allowed the records to be disclosed to members of her committee in mid-March — well before April 9.
Ultimately, Kansas Reflector received leaked copies of the requested records, and their authenticity was corroborated by Erickson’s tardy disclosure. In due course, the real reason for her delay became clear: the portal was a repository for criticism of the supermajority’s legislative agenda, and it was in the supermajority’s interest to keep that fact from the public for as long as possible.
 
Consistently arbitrary
Kansas Reflector’s request yielded disclosures of more than 1,600 submissions that Kansans had made to the portal. The names and contact information for just 55 submitters were redacted, while the names and contact information for the other 1,500-plus Kansans were disclosed.
Comparing the leaked records to Erickson’s disclosure shows that Senate President Ty Masterson’s submission is one of the 55 from which the name and contact information were redacted.
Redacting the identities of anyone, a potential gubernatorial candidate such as Masterson or not, violates KORA. Redactions due to privacy concerns are authorized under KORA only when disclosure of such information poses a serious risk to the person identified and is not “of legitimate concern to the public.”
There can be no doubt that the submissions to the politically charged government efficiency portal are of legitimate concern to the public, negating application of KORA’s privacy provision on that basis alone. Moreover, disclosure of someone’s name, address and email address does not put them at undue risk when that information is most likely available through a Google search.
Additionally, every person who submitted information to the portal was required to check a box acknowledging that submissions would be subject to KORA. That means each submitter effectively waived any application of KORA’s privacy provision.
Even so, in the April 9 email in which the Erickson disclosed the requested records to Kansas Reflector, she claimed that redactions were made for “the portions of records containing information of a personal nature where the public disclosure thereof would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”
Simply put, it is not credible to claim that KORA’s privacy provision applied to Kansas Reflector’s request. Moreover, the Legislature’s attempt to shield information about certain submissions and not others is evidence that it is willing to play favorites at the expense of being fair and complying with KORA in a timely manner.

There’s a vicious downward cycle that’s been at work in North Carolina state government in recent years. And here’s how it worked:
First, conservative politicians blast quote “government bureaucracy” and enact big tax and spending cuts in response.
Next, core services like schools, mental health, transportation, and public safety – plagued by funding cuts and staff reductions — all struggle mightily to keep up with rising demands in a fast-growing state.
Next, besieged by constituent complaints, the same politicians who imposed the big cuts decry the decline in services and move to turn agencies over to private interests and/or lower standards – so that for example, class sizes can rise, or driver’s licenses have to be renewed less frequently.
Finally, claiming to be motivated to improve quote “efficiency,” the same politicians impose more tax cuts and start the whole process over again.
The bottom line: slashing funding for basic public services does no more to improve outcomes than scrimping on the upkeep of your car or home. And it’s long past time for our state to break this vicious cycle.

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) appears Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" one stop on his ""full Ginsburg"" tour of all five network Sunday talk shows in one day. (Screenshot)Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) achieved a rare feat on Easter, when he appeared on all five network Sunday talk shows: “Face the Nation,” “State of the Union,” “Meet the Press,” “Fox News Sunday” and “This Week” on the same day.
It’s known as doing a “full Ginsburg,” named for William H. Ginsburg, who was serving as the attorney for then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky when he became the first person known to have completed the circuit on a single day.
Van Hollen’s TV appearances came just days after his return from El Salvador, where he met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Beltsville who was erroneously deported last month and sent to a notorious Salvadoran prison.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported, and ordered federal officials to “facilitate” his return. But Trump administration officials, who claim Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, have not made any effort to bring Abrego Garcia stateside. They argue that the U.S., which is paying El Salvador $6 milllion to old deportees, does not have the authority to do so since he’s in Salvadoran custody; Salvadorans have said they don’t have the authority to return him to the U.S.
During his appearances Sunday, Van Hollen challenged Trump officials to “put up or shut up” in court, bringing Abrego Garcia back to face charge here instead of spreading allegations about him on social media. Van Hollen said there is no evidence that Abrego Garcia committed any crime, and that the discussion about possible gang ties is merely a distraction.
“I am not defending the man. I’m defending the rights of this man to due process,” Van Hollen said on ABC’s “This Week.”

In their brief meeting Thursday, Abrego Garcia said he has been traumatized by the experience, Van Hollen said, and that he misses his family, including his 5-year-old son who has autism, and was in the car with his father at the time of his arrest.
Several hosts asked Van Hollen whether he’d walked into a trap by visiting Abrego Garcia, who appeared in plain clothes at a hotel to meet with the senator, with cold drinks on the table. As the meeting was taking place, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele was posting photos on social media claiming that Abrego Garcia was “now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador.”
“All of that was a setup. Their people ordered the waiters to bring these things that look like margaritas,” Van Hollen said on ABC. “It just goes to show the lengths that Bukele and Trump will go to try to deceive people about what this case is all about.”
Greetings from El Salvador
While he was in El Salvador for several days last week, trying to see Abrego Garcis, Van Hollen warned repeatedly that it didn’t matter if the Bukele administration denied him a visit because while he might have been the first member of Congress to visit the country, he would not be the last.
It appears he was right about that.
Van Hollen’s trip appears to have opened the flood gates. Four House Democrats said they made the trip this week: freshmen Reps. Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon, and second-term Reps. Robert Garcia of California and Maxwell Frost of Florida.
They had returned to the U.S. by Tuesday, but while in El Salvador had written U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanding regular check-ins with Abrego Garcia, as well as access to an attorney for him and a renewed effort to bring him back to the U.S. They also demanded access to another U.S. deportee being held in El Salvador, Venezuelan refugee Andry José Hernández Romero.
The trip, which they were careful to note was not taxpayer-funded, came after Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, rejected a request from Frost and Garcia for an official congressional delegation to visit CECOT, the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo where Abrego Garcia was being held until his transfer last week.
Comer called the request “absurd.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But those four may not be the last to make the El Salvador run: Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th), whose district includes Beltsville, where Abrego Garcia lived, has said he plans to travel to the Central American nation as well. Ivey, who wrote on X that he intends to take his trip in early May, also led a letter last week from 150 Democrats to President Donald Trump asking for updates on the efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.
It’s not just Democrats. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) visited CECOT last week to take a swipe at Democrats. And the National Republican Congressional Committee, seeing what it believes is a winning strategy for the GOP, offered — tongue in cheek, presumably — to pay for any Democrats who wanted to make the trip.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-2.23.25 AM-1024x571.png,,,2025-04-23 05:01:07.898536

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Earlier this month, the Ohio House passed its version of the biennial budget, setting priorities for the state with tens of billions of dollars of spending.
The House version of the budget had many significant changes from the governor’s original budget. The House axed tax hikes on cannabis, gaming, and tobacco, the latter of which could have saved tens of thousands of lives by reducing smoking rates in the state. They also cut the state library fund by $90 million, child care subsidies by $180 million, and removed a child tax credit for families with young children that could have directly supported half a million children and grown the economy.
One provision the House preserved from the executive budget, however, was a law that would immediately revoke health insurance for 770,000 Ohioans if the federal government reduced its contribution to Medicaid at the state level.
When the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress had a goal to ensure everyone in the United States had access to affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act did this in a number of ways: covering children with their parents’ health insurance until age 26, creating subsidies for lower- and middle-class families to purchase individual insurance, requiring employers to provide health insurance to full-time workers, prohibiting denials of coverage due to preexisting conditions.
One of the biggest elements of this strategy was expanding Medicaid coverage to all Americans  with incomes under 138% of the federal poverty level, with the federal government paying 90% of the health costs for this new “Medicaid Expansion” population. This provision was challenged in courts and the Supreme Court ultimately made this optional for states. To date, 40 states have accepted the federal dollars to provide health insurance to low-income residents, including Ohio.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Today, 94% of Ohio residents are covered by health insurance, one of the state’s strongest health metrics. According to the Ohio Department of Medicaid, 770,000 Ohio residents are covered by Medicaid Expansion, about 6.5% of the state population. If these people lost their health insurance immediately, the number of people without health insurance in the state would double in an instant.
That is exactly what the Medicaid provision introduced by the governor and as passed by the House will do if the federal government reduces its share of the Medicaid expansion support by as little as a dollar. Ohio is likely to join twelve other states by adopting language that would automatically cut the Medicaid expansion population from health insurance rolls if the federal government reduces its match rate.
If this happened in Ohio, 770,000 Ohio residents would automatically lose health insurance. This would also have ripple effects through the state economy. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates this would lead to a $72 billion reduction in federal Medicaid spending over the next ten years. That’s about $7.2 billion a year in health care spending that would evaporate from the state, roughly equal to 30% of Ohio’s economic growth over the past year, gone overnight.
These costs would compound over time. People without health insurance are less likely to get preventative screenings, leading them to more frequent emergency room use and more costly treatments. Evidence shows Medicaid expansion improved financial security, promoted tobacco cessation, and reduced rates of heart disease and premature death.
Medicaid is not cheap. But the evidence we have on it suggests it pays dividends to society. Legislators should think hard about the consequences of kicking 770,000 Ohio residents back into the ranks of the uninsured.

States worry that an executive order and federal funding cuts could weaken their cybersecurity efforts. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Budget restrictions, staff issues and AI are threats to states’ cybersecurity

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
 Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Governments often struggle with massive new IT projects

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
 Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
Rhode Island state government hit by major cyberattack

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

,California,2025-04-23 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Given its failures, can California manage a transition to a carbon-free future?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/04/california-carbon-free-transition/,"The mileposts on the road to a carbon-free California are beginning to appear, but the state is already falling behind. The just announced closure of another refinery isn't reassuring.","It’s become painfully obvious in recent years that California officialdom lacks the ability to plan and deliver major projects.
While examples abound, the state’s woebegone bullet train project, its tortuous efforts to implement information technology and the financial and managerial meltdown of its unemployment insurance program are among the most egregious.
Given that sorry record, why should we believe the state’s plans to completely overhaul California’s economy by eliminating hydrocarbon-based energy will be any more successful?
Over the next 20 years, California wants to replace nearly 30 million gasoline and diesel-powered cars and light trucks with those using batteries or hydrogen. Simultaneously  California is supposed to wean itself from natural-gas-fired electric power generation and increase power output, to recharge many millions of car batteries and service houses and commercial buildings that will no longer use gas.
The mileposts on the road to a carbon-free California are beginning to appear, and the state is already falling behind.
One of the biggest elements of the transition is Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decree that by 2035 all cars sold in California must be zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs for short, with an interim goal of 35% this year.
It’s not happening.
While there had been a surge in ZEV purchases in earlier years, they have leveled off at about 25%, well short of the 2025 expectation, and show no signs of increasing. The cost of battery-powered vehicles in an inflation-conscious era, fears of mileage limitations, and shortages of functioning recharging stations are among the reasons for the sales plateau.
California can’t force consumers to buy ZEVs. Its decrees are aimed at manufacturers, including fines for failing to meet sales quotas. Brian Mass, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said in a statement, “It’s time to admit that the state has hit a wall amid a lack of confidence in ZEV adoption, as well as a statewide shortage of EV charging stations.”
Dealers and their allies released a poll indicating that most Californians are unhappy with the 2035 cutoff of petroleum-powered car sales. 
Other aspects of California’s carbon-free conversion are also lagging. Blackout fears compelled Newsom and other state officials to delay the phaseout of gas-fired power plants in Southern California and to insist that the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo remain in service indefinitely, setting aside plans for decommissioning.
Implicitly the state’s efforts to eliminate petrofuels would require the eventual closure of California’s refineries, but it must also maintain supplies of gasoline and diesel fuel until the makeover is complete, which is a tricky balancing act.
Two refineries are already being closed, raising the spectre of fuel shortages that would drive California’s gas prices, already among the nation’s highest, upward.

Commentary 
If zero-emission cars cut gasoline sales and tax revenue, how will California replace them? 

by Dan Walters 





Valero is the latest to announce a shutdown, declaring its “current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations” at its Benicia refinery by the end of April 2026. The announcement followed last year’s decision by Phillips 66 to close its Southern California refinery, two days after Newsom signed a bill requiring refiners to maintain minimum gasoline supplies.
California is a petroleum fuel island, lacking pipelines that could bring in supplies from other states. In fact, motorists in Nevada and Arizona depend on California for their fuel. If refineries continue to close, California could be forced to bring in fuel from other nations via tanker or acquire the in-state refineries by purchase or seizure and operate them itself during the transition.
Asked about Valero’s announcement, Newsom replied that the state would address “any anxiety that may be created or any market disruption that may be created by that announcement.”
That’s not reassuring, given the state’s paper-thin record of successfully managing big projects and big emergencies.

Taylor. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Supreme Court justices appeared to side Tuesday with Montgomery County parents who say the county’s refusal to let them opt their children out of classes with LGBTQ-themed books violates their right to raise their children according to their faith.
The case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, stemmed from a 2023 lawsuit filed by a group of Muslim, Jewish and Christian parents after the school board after it introduced books for classes as early as pre-kindergarten that had stories featuring transgender or same-sex characters.
When the books were introduced in the 2022-23 school year, the school system let parents who objected to the books opt their children out of classes that used the books, as they can opt children out of health education classes they find offensive. But the board reversed itself in March 2023, saying students could not get out of the language arts classes using the books, which the schools called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
But to the parents in the case, it’s a religious issue, and “Parents, not school boards, should have the final say on such religious matters,” said Eric S. Baxter, the attorney representing the parents.
The question before the court was whether “public schools burden parents’ religious exercise by compelling elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents’ religious convictions and without the opportunity to opt out?”
Two lower courts have said it does not, ruling that books are not a religious burden because they do not compel students to change their beliefs. But in 2.5 hours of arguments Tuesday, the conservative majority appeared to question that, and to side with parents’ call for an opt-out.

“The plaintiffs here are not asking the school to change its curriculum,” said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. “They’re just saying, ‘Look, we want out.’ Why isn’t that feasible? What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?”
School board attorney Alan E. Schoenfeld said it could create dozens of students not being in classes, while teachers and staff would need to create additional instruction for those students and accommodate them in other places within the school.
“I think it is infeasible,” Schoenfeld said.
Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said he was “a bit mystified, as a lifelong resident of the county, how it came to this.” He asked Schoenfeld how Montgomery County, a “beacon of that religious liberty” in a state founded on religious liberty and tolerance, had reached a point of “not respecting religious liberty, given that history.”
“I just want to give you a chance to respond to how you situate that in Maryland and Montgomery County’s history,” Kavanaugh said.
Schoenfeld said the county’s 160,000-student public school system is the most religiously diverse in the country, and the school board has a difficult job “balancing the interests of a diverse community.”
“Montgomery County did its best under these circumstances, given their curricular goals,” he said. “That seems to me a fundamentally different question, and it’s an important one, but it is a fundamentally different question about whether there’s a constitutional right to opt your child out of curriculum that you deem religiously offensive.”
Meanwhile, the liberal justices questioned whether the mere presence of the books is coercive, and where the court should draw the line if it tries to create a rule on when parents can opt their children out of a class.
Justice Sonya Sotomayor highlighted one of the books, “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” about a girl worried that she will lose time with her uncle once he gets married, until his boyfriend befriends her. Sotomayor said no one in that book or any others “are even kissing.”
“The most they’re doing is holding hands. That mere exposure to that is coercion?” Sotomayor asked Baxter.
“Our parents would object to that,” Baxter replied.

Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson grilled Baxter and Sarah M. Harris, principal deputy solicitor general representing the Trump administration, noting that parents are not compelled to send their children to public school. If they object to LGBTQ-themed materials, she said, they can homeschool their children or send them to a private school.
“Most parents don’t have that option,” Baxter said. “They have two working parents. They can’t afford to send [their children] to private school.”
“I guess I’m worried about … a world in which there is an option to send your kid somewhere else, it seems to me that these parents would be dictating what this school does,” Jackson said.
LGBTQ+ liberation vs. indoctrination 
The case has national implications on the tension between religious freedoms and schools’ attempt to present an inclusive curriculum.
As oral arguments went on inside the courthouse, advocates on both sides of the case held rallies outside the courthouse. The two sides kept mostly to themselves, but on the few occasions they engaged, the debate was largely civil.
On the left side of the court plaza was a sea of rainbows and pride flags, as several dozen advocates played pop hits, sang, danced, and performed spoken word poetry in support of curriculum that includes LGBTQ+ people and issues.
Lee Blinder, executive director of Trans Maryland and co-chair for the Coalition for Inclusive Schools & Communities, said that “young people do not deserve the message that they and their families are not a full and complete part of this society.”
“One cannot opt out of our existence because we are your loved ones. We are your teachers, your janitorial staff, your fellow students, the families of your fellow students. We are an inalienable part of the fabric of this society,” Blinder said.
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), a member of the Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, stressed the importance of inclusive curriculum in schools.

“We’re here to say that we are not just going to honor our history – we are going to make sure that every single generation is aware and taught about, and our contribution is incorporated into every school instruction,” he said. “We know this country has denied the rights and dignity of a number of people, and we refuse to stand by as it erases, not just the contributions of queer folks, but it chooses to erase us as a people altogether.”
On the right side of the courthouse plaza, a few dozen supporters of parental opt-outs in education stood and sat in the shade listening in to the oral arguments being played on speakers.
Billy Moges, director of a coalition of parents called Kids First, said that it is “our constitutional right to parent and for our kids to believe in what they believe in.”
“We do believe that justices will do the right thing. We trust that their judgment will be in alignment with their rules and with the Constitution,” she said during Tuesday morning’s rally.
When arguments concluded shortly after 12:30 p.m., Baxter felt confident that the Supreme Court was more sympathetic to the plaintiff’s side.
“The court recognized that the books themselves were problematic,” he said to reporters. “Add on to that instruction from teachers – that these books were intended to encourage kids to explore different identities, to ignite their curiosity, to teach them that they can be a boy or a girl or both or neither.
“Parents aren’t asking to stop educating their children about the world around them,” Baxter said. “What they’re asking is to stop having them be indoctrinated on things that violate their religious beliefs.”

region. John McCosh/Georgia Recorder (file)The American Lung Association’s 2025 annual air quality index gives failing grades to Georgia’s population center for smog and air pollution.
The American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” report released Wednesday ranks Atlanta third worse in ozone pollution and fourth worse in year-round counts for particle pollution in the Southeast. The association’s 28th annual report examines data during a three-year window from  2021 to 2023, a period during the transition out of a pandemic that had kept the roads clearer due to more people working from home.  
Atlanta’s grade also slips from a C to F for ground-level ozone pollution after recording 5.5 unhealthy days per year compared to 1.8 days in the 2024 report. 
Atlanta’s ozone emissions ranks 48th worst out of 228 cities across the country, which is the third worst metro area in Southeast. Atlanta ranked 67th worst nationally in the association’s 2024 findings.
The 2025 report issued Atlanta a failing grade for short-term spikes in particle pollution levels recorded above the federal standard. 
Atlanta, which received a failing grade in 2024, was ranked 34th worst out of 204 nationally and tied for fourth worst metro area in Southeast. 
The report measures levels of ozone, which is one of the components of smog that becomes worse during the summer as Georgia’s dog days set in. The program also tracks the amount of particle pollution emitted from industrial sources such as power plants.
Nearly half of the U.S. population live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, the report says.
Danna Thompson, advocacy director for the lung association in Georgia, said that poor air quality, particularly caused by ozone, poses a health risk to children and the elderly, as well as people suffering with pre-existing conditions like asthma or heart disease.
She said it’s important that commuters help reduce emissions, especially in metropolitan areas where the amount of smog is affected by the number of cars and trucks traveling along roads and highways.
“When heading into higher temperatures in the summer in the South, we certainly really encourage people to consider taking and using other forms of transportation, whether it’s biking, walking, taking trains because cars and the trucking industry do impact air quality,” Thompson said.
According to the Atlanta Regional Commission, there has been a significant reduction in air pollution emissions since 2010. ARC publishes online transportation-related emissions data, which has included Environmental Protection Agency data since 2020.
According to the regional commission, transportation contributes about 10% of air pollution in the region, while power generation and manufacturing are also major sources of air pollution.
Thompson said the lung association is concerned about the potential rollback to Clean Air Act regulations that are designed to protect the public and environment.
Last week, the Trump administration’s EPA granted a two-year exemption  allowing several power plants across the nation, including Georgia Power’s coal-firing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer, to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
Thompson said it’s tough to determine what is the largest factor that changes the levels of pollution recorded on a year-to-year basis.  
Thompson said the report highlights the need for the EPA to set up more air quality monitors in Georgia since only 27 of 159 counties currently have the equipment used to measure how safe air is.
“It’s hard to pinpoint one factor that causes the air quality to to be worse,” she said. “The ozone is like a powerful oxidant. It’s like household bleach. When it’s inhaled, ozone damages the tissues in our respiratory tract.”
The 2025 American Lung Association report’s other notable findings for Georgia include Augusta ranking among cleanest in the nation for ozone smog while also tying for fourth worst in the Southeast for year-round level of particle pollution.
Savannah was dinged from an “A” to a “B” because of higher levels of ozone smog.

The report measures levels of ozone, which is one of the components of smog that becomes worse during the summer as Georgia’s dog days set in. The program also tracks the amount of particle pollution emitted from industrial sources such as power plants.
Nearly half of the U.S. population live in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, the report says.
Danna Thompson, advocacy director for the Lung Association in Georgia, said that poor air quality, particularly caused by  ozone, poses a health risk to children and the elderly, as well as people suffering with pre-existing conditions like asthma or heart disease.
She said it’s important that commuters help reduce emissions, especially in metropolitan areas where the amount of smog is affected by the number of cars and trucks traveling along roads and highways.
“When heading into higher temperatures in the summer in the South, we certainly really encourage people to consider taking and using other forms of transportation, whether it’s biking, walking, taking trains because  cars and the trucking industry do impact air quality,” Thompson said.
According to the Atlanta Regional Commission, there has been a significant reduction in air pollution emissions since 2010. ARC publishes online transportation-related emissions data, which has included Environmental Protection Agency data since 2020.
According to the regional commission, transportation contributes about 10% of air pollution in the region, while power generation and manufacturing are also major sources of air pollution
Thompson said the lung association is concerned about the potential rollback to Clean Air Act regulations that are designed to protect the public and environment.
Last week, President Donald Trump administration’s EpA granted a two-year exemption  allowing several power plants across the nation, including Georgia Power’s coal-firing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
Thompson said it’s tough to determine what is the largest factor that changes the levels of pollution recorded on a year to year basis.  
Thompson said the report highlights the need for the EPA to set up more air quality monitors in Georgia since only 27 of 159 counties currently have the equipment used to measure how safe air is.
“It’s hard to pinpoint one factor that causes the air quality to to be worse,” she said. “ The ozone is like a  powerful oxidant. It’s like household bleach. When it’s inhaled, ozone damages the tissues in our respiratory tract.”
The 2025  American Lung Association report  other notable findings for Georgia include Augusta ranking among cleanest in the nation for ozone smog while also tying for fourth worst in the Southeast for year-round level of particle pollution.
Savannah was dinged from an “A” to a “B” because of higher levels of ozone smog.

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Five weeks before Election Day, at an evening ceremony at the office of the U.S. Department of State, America’s first-ever Arctic ambassador was sworn into his new job.
Barely 100 days later, on Jan. 20, Mike Sfraga resigned — departing his post, like other ambassadors, as Donald Trump took power.
 
America’s first Arctic ambassador was just confirmed weeks ago. Now he could be out of a job.

	Now, Sfraga’s position remains unfilled. And Alaskans and others tracking America’s stance toward the Arctic are waiting to see when, or if, the new administration will offer a clear vision or plans for the region that the U.S., its allies and rivals are increasingly eying as a zone for commerce and military activity.
“It’s feeling very quiet,” said Diane Hirshberg, who leads a research institute at University of Alaska Anchorage and is academic vice president at an international network of schools called University of the Arctic. “We’re just in this weird land of uncertainty.”
At a recent working group meeting of an international commission called the Arctic Council, Hirshberg said, the American government representative shared nothing, “other than that the U.S. reserves the right to comment at a later date.”
Experts say that Trump’s outspoken desire to annex Greenland makes clear that he’s aware of the Arctic’s growing strategic value. But they also say that his distrust of traditional European alliances and his targeting of research institutions risk undermining the nation’s interests in the region.

	“There are other nations questioning us,” Sfraga said at an Alaska legislative hearing this month. “Every one of our allies in the North and elsewhere, they’re questioning how committed we are.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who’s long prodded the federal government to develop its Arctic policy, said she thinks the new administration appreciates the significance of the region for its natural resources and importance to American national security. 
But she said she’s pushing for that awareness to be backed up with qualified personnel — new appointees to Arctic-focused positions like the ambassador job.
“At some of these Arctic conferences, I’m there,” she said in an interview. “But the U.S. delegation has to be more than just Lisa Murkowski.”
Former President Joe Biden created the Arctic ambassador position through an executive action, and it’s not set out in law — a fact that Murkowski, via legislation she introduced earlier this year, hopes to change.

	She said she’s also submitted names to the Trump administration to consider for the post and is concerned that if the decision is delayed, the new ambassador nominee could end up being a campaign donor chosen “as, kind of, a political favor.” 
Murkowski said she’d love to see Sfraga reappointed to the position.
Biden originally nominated Sfraga, an Alaskan geographer who’d worked at a think tank and in Alaska’s university system, to the ambassadorship in early 2023. 
Murkowski recommended Sfraga for the post and lobbied for his confirmation.
But it took more than 18 months for the U.S. Senate to take an up or down vote. Some Republican senators, led by Idaho Republican James Risch, criticized Sfraga’s relationships with officials and institutions from China and Russia.
Sfraga said in an email that filling his old post is in America’s best interest. 
“The United States requires a Senate-confirmed ambassador so we can inform, influence and appropriately lead Arctic-related issues and policies throughout the region, clearly articulate U.S. Arctic goals and objectives, and ensure our policies and efforts are coordinated and advanced at home,” he said.
Asked whether he’d take the job back if chosen by Trump — as suggested by Murkowski — Sfraga thanked the senator for her “unwavering support.”
“It is now time to consider other opportunities to advance U.S. and allied partners’ interests in the Arctic, and Alaska’s unique role in the region’s future,” he said.
Alaska’s sole member of the U.S. House, Republican Nick Begich III, said in an emailed statement that an Arctic ambassador supports a strong presence in the region, “which is vital for national security.”
“I will continue to work with the executive branch and members of the Alaska delegation to advocate for an Arctic policy that includes leadership staffing as a component of our national security strategy,” Begich said.
The State Department, in an emailed statement to Northern Journal, did not directly answer a question about if and when the new administration plans to replace Sfraga. But it did say that the Office of the Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Affairs “remains funded and operational.”
That’s in contrast to the Wilson Center — a 55-year-old think tank that once employed Sfraga when he was the founding director of the center’s Polar Institute. 
The center, which focuses on foreign policy, has been almost entirely shut down by the new administration, with more than 100 employees placed on leave and just a handful of congressionally mandated positions remaining, according to the New York Times. The Polar Institute’s current director did not respond to a request for comment.
At the U.S. Department of Defense, meanwhile, the administration has filled one top Arctic-focused position. Last month, Steven Schleien, a longtime department official, was named deputy assistant secretary for Arctic and global resilience — with responsibilities that include Arctic security, ocean issues and critical minerals.
One other person that experts see as a potentially influential voice on the administration’s Arctic policy is Julia Nesheiwat. 
Nesheiwat currently has no formal role in the administration. But she’s a former homeland security adviser to Trump and a former member of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, and her husband, Mike Waltz, is Trump’s national security advisor.
Nesheiwat recently traveled with Waltz, Vice President J.D. Vance and other top administration officials to Greenland. She also held a meeting with Republican Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy at an energy conference in Texas last month.
Murkowski said she’s spoken about Arctic policy with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and her former U.S. Senate colleague. 
She also sent the president and other top administration officials a letter last month outlining her Arctic-related priorities — including the appointment of a special presidential assistant focused on the region, and the creation of a new deputy assistant secretary for Arctic affairs at the State Department.
Murkowski, who’s publicly clashed with Trump at times, acknowledged that some in the new administration “would love to deep-six anything that I might suggest.”
“But I know that you have people who are genuinely interested in advancing good policy,” she said. “I think they’re looking for suggestions.”

Andy Barr confirmed his run for U.S. Senate Tuesday by unveiling a video.
He later announced his candidacy in person, introduced by his young daughter Mary Clay to a crowd of supporters gathered on the lawn of an old mansion in Richmond.

Entering his first statewide race, the six-term congressman from Lexington stressed his bona fides as both a Kentuckian and Trump loyalist.
After his announcement speech, Barr told reporters he had asked Trump for his endorsement. “I have, and I’d be honored to have it, and I continue to work to earn it. That’s what I said to the president,” Barr said.
“I’m in a unique position as a member of the U.S. House to actually advance the agenda, to defend the president, to fight for … these America First policies.” 
Kentuckians will send someone new to the U.S. Senate in November 2026 to fill the seat that Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell will be leaving after 42 years.
Barr already faces former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron in the Republican primary to succeed McConnell. Cameron, who has twice run statewide — winning the attorney general race in 2019 and losing the 2023 governor’s race to Democratic incumbent Andy Beshear — announced his candidacy in February moments after McConnell announced he was retiring. Also mulling entering the Republican primary is Lexington businessman Nate Morris.
Barr starts his race with a fundraising edge. He reported raising $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2025 and has $5.3 million on hand, according to federal campaign finance reports. Cameron reported having raised $508,000 for his Senate run as of March 31.

On the Democratic side, state House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, has announced. Frequently mentioned as a possible candidate is Rocky Adkins, a senior adviser to Beshear and former state House Democratic floor leader.
Barr told reporters he had spent the first few months of this year assessing his statewide support “and everywhere we turned it was a green light.”
“We’re not looking past the primary, but ultimately, the general election electorate is going to select the next senator from Kentucky.  … I know that this Commonwealth of Kentucky overwhelmingly elected President Trump and Kentucky deserves a United States senator who will support President Trump and his agenda, and he knows that I am with him.” 
In announcing, Barr echoed some familiar Trump themes. He denounced “insane DEI initiatives,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that Trump has banned in the federal government and is moving to end elsewhere. Barr also picked up on Trump’s presidential campaign’s emphasis on transgender issues, vowing to “lock up the sickos who allow biological men to share locker rooms with our daughters.”

Describing  himself as “an eighth-generation Kentuckian, the grandson of World War II veterans,” Barr said he is “a man who loves my family and friends, who lives and breathes everything Kentucky, bourbon, horses and Kentucky basketball.”
Republican legislators attending Barr’s announcement included Sen. Phillip Wheeler of Pikeville, Sen. Scott Madon of Pineville, Rep. Kim King of Harrodsburg and Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe of Lexington.
Barr said he was holding the event in Madison County because conservative voters there “always have been and always will be the firewall of our campaigns.”
Barr was first elected to the U.S. House in 2012, defeating Democratic incumbent Ben Chandler. Currently, he is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairman of the Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
In December Barr lost a Republican caucus vote to be chairman of the powerful Financial Services Committee, which oversees U.S. banking  and monetary policy. He had earlier said a House committee chairmanship would preclude his running for the Senate, McClatchy reported.
In the weeks leading up to Barr’s announcement, the congressman was among Republicans facing pressure from their constituents to have an in-person town hall over growing frustrations with Trump’s agenda. Last month, more than 900 people gathered for a town hall at the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington, but Barr declined to attend. He did have a telephone town hall days later. 
The Republican primary looks to be contentious between Barr and Cameron, particularly as they seek a coveted endorsement from Trump. Cameron had Trump’s backing for his failed 2023 race. Barr has consistently emphasized his support for the president’s agenda and for his billionaire adviser Elon Musk. At a White House event earlier this month, Trump said while acknowledging Barr’s attendance: “Good luck with everything. I hear good things.”  
A possible third GOP candidate, Morris, the Lexington businessman, has gained the eye of Trump allies, including the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Morris’ support for the president’s tariff plans was included in a recent White House press release. 
Kentucky Democratic Party Chair Colmon Elridge in a statement said Barr in Congress has done “absolutely nothing” while the Trump administration “cripples our economy, sends prices skyrocketing, targets Kentucky’s signature industries and threatens to gut health care that 1.5 million Kentuckians rely on.”
“Today, he managed to launch his U.S. Senate campaign with a two-minute video that grovels for Trump’s endorsement and ignores the very real problems Kentuckians face every day,” Elridge said.
Barr’s Senate candidacy now opens the race for Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District — a seat in central Kentucky that Democrats are hoping to flip. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) previously listed Barr’s current seat as one of the districts it views as in play heading into midterm elections in 2026. 
On Tuesday, the DCCC said Barr’s decision creating an open seat makes Kentucky’s 6th District “even more winnable,” noting that Democrat Beshear carried the district 60-40. “Kentuckians deserve a representative who will put their interests first — fighting to lower costs, create good jobs, and protect their health care, not another rubberstamp for their D.C. party boss’s agenda of tax breaks for billionaires,” said the DCCC statement.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)A controversial bill to support arts programs but that left more than a dozen without expected funds passed a near-final hurdle in the Senate on Monday.
On a 29-21 vote, the Senate approved House Bill 9, with a reminder from Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula, of the source of the funds for the programs.
“These projects are powered by coal,” said Boldman, who carried the bill in the Senate.
HB 9 appropriates $953,500 for cultural and aesthetic grants, including money for museums, at least one library, a history project, dance company and other arts groups.
Originally, around 75 groups asked for grants of $12,500 to $13,000 each, but that’s not how legislators allocated the dollars.
Earlier this session, sponsor Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, sparked criticism from people in the arts community after he suggested groups whose representatives didn’t testify at the Capitol about their programs were “slackers” and shouldn’t get funding.
“They’re running a business, and they can’t even take five minutes for a ‘give-me’ check?” Fitzpatrick, chairperson of the subcommittee, said earlier.
Some arts leaders said they didn’t know their appearance was mandatory.
Staff from the Montana Arts Council, which administers the program for the state, told lawmakers that they had mistakenly communicated to the groups that their attendance was not required, and attendance would not impact funding.
Nonetheless, legislators in the subcommittee unanimously agreed to cut funding from groups that didn’t show up in person to testify and reduce funds for groups that submitted only written testimony.
Lawmakers subsequently made only slight adjustments to the bill, and on the Senate floor Tuesday, Boldman stressed that the funding allocations are up to legislators, who are not a rubber stamp.
“It’s not a lot of money, but it’s still public money, so we do take that seriously,” Boldman said.
She said if groups didn’t appear either remotely or in person, then their applications weren’t funded, and 17 fell into that category.
However, Boldman described the funded projects as “awesome” and representing counties across Montana.
She described the process in response to a question from Sen. Jacinda Morigeau, D-Arlee, about how funding decisions were made.
Morigeau said some of her constituents had reached out to tell her the process wasn’t clear this year.
“I just wanted to stand up on their behalf and say that it is a real detriment to some of these small rural, rural, rural programs, that they weren’t funded,” Morigeau said.
However, Morigeau also said she would encourage them to apply again in two years.
Sen. Bob Phalen, R-Lindsay, wanted to know if some of the establishments that received funding were “still displaying obscenities.”
Phalen said he wasn’t referring to any specific project but to a bill he sponsored in 2023 to curb obscenity.
In response, Boldman said she wasn’t aware of any establishments showcasing obscene material.
Earlier reporting by the Daily Montanan found the applicant for one group requesting money was Fitzpatrick’s wife, and it was among those that received more money than originally proposed, and the only one to receive more than twice its original request.
Fitzpatrick, though, earlier told the Daily Montanan that he didn’t have a conflict of interest to disclose, at least not any more than he could be seen to have one with any other number of groups in his district.
On the Senate floor, Boldman said she too is connected with some of the groups, such as a children’s theater in which her son participates.
Sen. Christopher Pope, D-Bozeman, said he supported the bill, but he also didn’t want to see arts organizations stricken from the bill in the future, having seen “quality organizations being crossed off.”
However, Sen. Denley Loge, R-St. Regis, said the grants help small communities such as his, and he appreciates the idea that those who want support show up.
“It shows that they have to have a little skin in the game of time and involvement,” Loge said.
The bill earlier passed the House on a 58-39 vote, and it needs to pass another vote in the Senate.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-23 00:01:14.978552

Dunleavy vetoed House Bill 69 last week, citing cost concerns and the lack of policy measures he endorsed. With the House and Senate meeting in joint session, the vote to override Dunleavy was 33-27, sustaining the veto. Forty of the Legislature’s 60 members were needed for an override. 
In its final version, HB 69 would have increased the state’s base student allocation, core of the K-12 funding formula, by $1,000 per student. That would have resulted in $253 million more per year for public schools, if fully funded.
Last year, the Legislature voted overwhelmingly in favor of a smaller, $174 million formula increase. Dunleavy vetoed that bill as well. Lawmakers then failed by a single vote to override the governor’s decision.
Unlike in 2024, when education supporters packed the Capitol to urge an override, there was no major protest accompanying the override vote. A single pro-override sign-waver stood outside the Capitol for about 30 minutes during lunchtime, then departed amid a light drizzle.
As the joint session got underway, Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, spoke first. 
“It is with great reluctance that I stand here today to support the governor’s veto,” he said. “As everyone is well aware we have a major budget deficit. Not only in the current year that we are in, some $150 million, but we also have a substantial amount for the coming fiscal year.”
Hoffman said that while he supports a $1,000 BSA increase, lawmakers must address raising new revenues first. The Senate is currently considering revenue measures, including changes to the state’s oil tax and corporate taxes. 
Hoffman said revenue measures could make a $1,000 BSA increase affordable.
“If we truly say that education is our No. 1 priority, we should stand behind it fiscally,” he said.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, spoke in support of overriding the veto to provide much-needed school funding.

“Year after year of flat funding is resulting in harm to our children. We are punishing them for the mistakes that we as a Legislature have made, and it is not fair,” he said.
Many lawmakers spoke of school districts facing severe budget deficits, staff and program cuts, and school closures. 
“The consequences of underfunding are being felt deeply. A meaningful increase to the BSA would help prevent the devastating cuts our districts are now being forced to make,” said Sen. Elvi Gray-Jackson, D-Anchorage, who supported the veto override. “Funding public education is not a game.”
Other lawmakers objected to the lack of education policy reforms in the bill, as Dunleavy pressed for during a news conference announcing the veto on Thursday. 
“I’m objecting to forcing people to contribute more without any discussion of performance measures,” said Rep. Mike Prax, R-North Pole, who voted to sustain the veto. 
Rep. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay, spoke in support of overriding the veto, protecting the Permanent Fund dividend, and raising new state revenue. 
“This bill is expensive, and it still isn’t enough. With the frozen funding and grants running dry, the future is uncertain, but we can’t build our future on deficit spending either,” she said. “We can’t take the PFD, which is often a matter of life and death in rural Alaska. When our savings run out of money, Alaska, lights go dark. It is time to stop hoping for high oil prices or more visitors on cruise ships who will save us. We are out of options. It is time to ask without fear, how will we pay for this? And it’s time to clearly say, we need to raise new revenues, and we shouldn’t be scared of that.” 
During his speech against the override, Hoffman said that the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve — the largest remaining state savings account — was not intended to pay for recurring expenses.
Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and co-chair of the House Finance Committee, argued against Hoffman’s statement a few minutes later.
“There’s been esteemed members of the Legislature who’ve noted that this is an affordability question, and I don’t agree with that,” he said.
The House’s version of the operating budget — including a $1,000 BSA increase — has a deficit of $67 million, Josephson said. In contrast, the CBR has a balance of $2.8 billion.
“That’s 2.4%. So I can’t go to my constituents and say, this is just unaffordable. Because it’s not. It’s just a question of will, that’s all,” Josephson said, arguing that savings can be used to pay for education.
The deficit in the House’s draft budget may be larger than Josephson stated, because it contains a cut whose constitutionality has been questioned, and it does not include deficits in the capital budget or the supplemental budget, two separate documents.
After more than an hour of speeches, members of the House and Senate voted 33-27 to sustain the governor’s veto of House Bill 69. 
The override vote was almost identical to the votes on the original bill, which passed the House and Senate by a combined vote of 32-25. 
Reps. Elexie Moore, R-Wasilla; Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks; and Mike Prax, R-North Pole, were absent from the original House vote and acted to sustain the veto. Sen. Donny Olson, D-Golovin, voted against the original bill but in favor of the override.
Afterward, he walked past reporters and did not answer questions about why he changed his vote.
The tally fell along caucus lines for members of the House, with members of the House’s multipartisan majority — two Republicans, five independents and 14 Democrats — voting to override and all 19 members of the House’s all-Republican minority voting to sustain.
Among members of the Senate, Sens. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, and Bert Stedman, R-Sitka, voted to sustain the veto alongside all six members of the Senate’s minority caucus. The remaining 12 members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority voted to override.
After the vote, the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, spoke with reporters and expressed her disappointment with the Legislature’s failure to override the governor’s veto for the second year in a row. 
“Previously, when we had the funds, we lacked the political will,” she said. “I believe that there is great political will at this point to try to do something about how we’re funding our schools, or failing to fund our schools, and we lack the funds. So I think this outcome was somewhat predictable, but that doesn’t make it any less disappointing.”
In a statement on social media, Dunleavy thanked lawmakers for voting to sustain his veto.

“Their action shows a clear understanding of our fiscal situation and the fact that the bill had zero policy to create a better educational outcome for our students,” he wrote.
He added that legislators now have “a clear path” to consider an alternative bill he proposed on Friday.
The governor’s bill includes a smaller funding increase and policy provisions he prefers.
“We’ve got 30 days to get the job done. Let’s finish it. We can do this,” said Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.
Members of the House minority also offered comments in support of the governor’s alternative.
“We still have a lot of airstrip left,” said Rep. Bill Elam, R-Nikiski and a vote to sustain the veto. “We haven’t completely landed all of this. We can continue. We have some opportunities.”
But Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the Senate majority’s lead negotiator with the governor, said that at least some of the governor’s ideas are nonstarters.
Speaking to reporters, he offered an example: a section of the bill that would allow first-come, first-served open enrollment at public schools. That doesn’t make sense, Wielechowski said, because it could keep local students from enrolling at the school closest to them.
More broadly and significantly, Wielechowski said there appears to be a fundamental disagreement in multiple sections of the bill about the amount of control the executive branch should have over local schools.
“I don’t know how we can get over that,” he said.
Last week, Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, told reporters that in his view, it’s significant that school districts are not requesting the kinds of policy changes that the governor is seeking.
“There are some things in there that we can coalesce around, but we still have a ways to go and be able to reconcile policy differences,” he said.
If the failed override does mean no permanent funding increase this year, a one-year funding bonus remains possible. The House’s draft operating budget includes a one-time, $253 million funding bonus equivalent to the vetoed formula.
That would be $79 million more than last year’s budget, which contained a $174 million one-time bonus, but the House’s proposed amount is subject to approval by the Senate and Dunleavy, who has line-item veto power. Senate budget leaders have said they plan to pass a budget without a deficit.
In a news conference last week, the governor said that if lawmakers present a deficit-free budget with one-time funding, he’d be willing to discuss the issue.

Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for BETThe 2025 Georgia legislative session has concluded, so it is time to take a moment and reflect on a bill that should have passed but did not: House Bill 237.
Within the first 30 seconds of Young Thug’s 2018 song “Anybody” he raps, “I never killed anybody, but I got something to do with that body.” Later in the song Thug continues, “Getting all types of cash, I’m a general true…” This was just one of the lyrics that the Fulton County prosecution presented, arguing that “general”  demonstrated Thug’s leadership role in the YSL gang. During Georgia’s longest trial, Judge Ural Glanville allowed 17 sets of lyrics from Young Thug and other co-defendants to enter the trial.  
It’s a troubling trend. Prosecutors around the country have used rap lyrics as evidence in criminal trials, despite the fact that rap lyrics—like movies, books, and lyrics from other musical genres—are often fictionalized. Yet, rap lyrics—often written and performed by Black artists—continue to be weaponized by prosecutors as criminal evidence in court.
A solution is House Bill 237, which didn’t pass the 2025 General Assembly session but remains alive for the 2026 session. With Democratic and Republican sponsors (one being the chairman of the Creative Arts and Entertainment Committee), the bill would limit the use of creative expression as evidence, ensuring fairer court proceedings and reducing potential bias. If Georgia can offer tax incentives to the entertainment industry, it is surely time for the state to safeguard the creative expression it seeks to attract. Indeed, California passed a similar law and Louisiana amended its evidence codes regarding admissibility of character evidence. In Louisiana, this means that artistic expressions, such as rap lyrics, cannot be used to demonstrate that the defendant is violent or capable of committing a particular crime but can instead be used to establish intent, knowledge, or motive.  
Georgia lawmakers should pass HB 237 or similar legislation in 2026 to protect free speech, limit the prejudicial use of creative expression in courtrooms, and ensure fairer trials.  
The Young Thug trial demonstrated that rap lyrics, often unrelated to the facts of the criminal case at issue, create juror bias when they’re used as evidence. The injustice extends beyond just trials: Lyrics also may be used as evidence in probation violation parole revocation proceedings in Georgia’s courts. 
HB 237 takes a necessary step toward limiting the prejudicial use of creative expression in criminal proceedings. First, it applies to several forms of creative expression—not just music but also poetry, performance art, and symbols. Second, it establishes a reasonable balance of interests by preliminarily marking creative expression as inadmissible unless prosecutors can demonstrate a direct connection between the creative expression and the crime or violation at issue. This prevents jurors from unfairly associating an artist’s fictional words with actual unlawful activity. This is particularly important with rap lyrics because rap is a genre that often references violence and various types of crime, as well as using expletives and racial epithets. Allowing such prejudicial content in the courtroom risks causing a jury to view the defendant in a less favorable or more stereotypical light than they otherwise would.
Critics argue that HB 237 will prevent prosecutors from using crucial evidence. However, the bill does not impose a blanket ban on lyrics or creative works in court. Instead, it ensures that creative expression is used only when it is directly relevant to a case. This distinction matters. Without it, courts are allowing lyrics to be introduced essentially as character evidence—which is generally disfavored in legal proceedings because it unfairly influences jurors. Importantly, HB 237 also does not add unnecessary steps to the criminal process. Judges already regularly receive and rule on pretrial motions to determine admissibility of evidence before trial. This bill simply uses an already existing judicial procedure to ensure that rulings are focused on facts—not biased stereotypes. 
Georgia is positioning itself as a national entertainment hub, reporting $8.55 billion in entertainment-related economic output in fiscal year 2022 alone. But if the state values this economic impact, it must also protect the rights of artists who are the backbone of the entertainment industry. Whether it’s music, literature, or film, art is not a confession. Georgia should recognize that. HB 237 should make a much needed re-appearance in the next legislative session.

More than 50 members of United Campus Workers of Kentucky, West KY NOW, Murray State Alliance and the Murray State University College Democrats participated in the event.
Brian Bourke, a professor and program coordinator in the Higher Education and Student Affairs master’s program at Murray and a member of United Campus Workers, said he hopes the university community realizes the potential dangers that international students are facing under the Trump administration. 
“During the rally, I did hear some people who stopped by the table expressing shock and dismay that a member of our community had their visa revoked,” Bourke said. “It also demonstrates that Murray State is part of a broader world of higher education in the United States, and that the bad things don’t only happen at the bigger name institutions we tend to hear about in the news.”
Murray State University College Democrats wrote an open letter last week calling on the university administration “to make public statements about their commitment to the safety of all members of the MSU community.” 
Katelyn Gardner, a junior and secretary of the campus Democrats, said, “International students and workers provide so much good to our university, and they deserve to be advocated for. It’s up to us to provide our support and call on university officials to commit publicly to offer their support as well.”
She said it’s important for organizations to advocate for international students because the political climate can make it risky for the students to advocate for themselves. 
“With both the letter and the rally, we hope that university administration will take more responsibility for student and staff safety and wellbeing,” Gardner said. “We hope for more information and guidelines to be given to students and staff so that they have a better understanding of their rights, and they feel safer and better supported at a school that they worked incredibly hard to be at.”
Student Government Association President Ali Khatib, a Palestinian-American, told the rally that international students are being punished for voicing their opinions, including opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza. “I really think we’re in for some scary times, and I hope that more and more people can be aware of what’s going on.”
Inside Higher Ed reports that more than 1,500 students from nearly 250 colleges have had their visas revoked by the Trump administration, but their identities and why they’ve been targeted are still largely unknown.
Earlier this month, the University of Kentucky reported a “small number” of graduate students had their visas revoked by the Department of Homeland Security. Officials from private Campbellsville University told Inside Higher Ed that some of its international students had their visas revoked but declined to say how many.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5258.heic,,,2025-04-22 22:05:29.552500

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska continues to grapple with fiscal uncertainty, the Alaska Permanent Fund remains at the heart of the conversation. Its performance and structure profoundly affect our state’s budget, the future of the Permanent Fund dividend, and the long-term economic health of Alaska. Yet its structure — specifically the division between the Earnings Reserve Account and the principal — is no longer serving us well. In fact, it’s creating a slow bleed of our spendable savings. Proposals to merge the two accounts into a single constitutionally protected fund are not just about simplifying accounting. They are about correcting a dangerous flaw in how we draw money from the Permanent Fund and effectively creating a spending limit on the fund.
To understand why, we need to briefly unpack how the fund works today.
The fund is divided into two accounts: the principal, which is constitutionally protected and cannot be spent without a vote of the people, and the Earnings Reserve Account, which holds realized investment earnings and is fully spendable with a simple majority vote of the Legislature.
Since 2018, Alaska has followed a Percent of Market Value draw system to sustainably use fund earnings. The formula allows for a 5% annual draw based on the average total market value of the entire fund — both the principal and the ERA. However, there’s a fundamental problem: While the draw is calculated using the full value of the fund, the money can only be taken from the ERA. The Legislature is legally prohibited from touching the principal, which means the full value of the fund is theoretical when it comes to actual cash available.
This creates an imbalance that threatens the very sustainability the Percent of Market Value system was designed to protect. Here’s why: Realized gains from investments, like selling a stock at profit, flow into the ERA, where they become available to spend. But unrealized gains — paper increases in asset values — primarily remain in the principal. The problem is that most of the fund’s growth has been in unrealized gains, which are locked away. Meanwhile, the Legislature continues to draw 5% of the average total fund value every year — but only from the ERA.
This means the ERA is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. In years of market volatility or lower realized returns, this pressure becomes even more acute. And because the ERA is fully spendable with a simple majority vote, it’s vulnerable to political pressure. The temptation to overdraw is always there.
Merging the ERA with the principal into a single, constitutionally protected fund fixes this flaw. It doesn’t just simplify fund management; it changes how the Fund can be accessed. All earnings – realized and unrealized – would remain in the unified fund. The only way money could be withdrawn would be through a constitutional Percent of Market Value draw.
This is not a minor shift. It would be the most significant fiscal reform in Alaska in a generation. It creates a hard cap on spending from the fund, one tied directly to its performance and sustainability. No more treating realized gains as a checking account. Instead, the entire fund is protected, and spending from it is limited to what is sustainable over the long term.
In the end, this reform is about protecting the Permanent Fund, the PFD, and Alaska’s fiscal future. The fund was created to turn a temporary resource boom into a permanent financial legacy. But that legacy only survives if we guard it against political pressure and short-term thinking.
This is more than a fiscal policy debate. It’s about protecting the fund for future generations, ensuring the PFD survives, and building a system that supports long-term stability. Merging the accounts creates the discipline Alaska needs — and the legacy Alaskans deserve.

It was the monitor’s 22nd visit to the prisons, and revealed both signs of improvement and lingering or worsening problems for the two facilities. The monitor noted that the populations at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake were “significantly higher” compared to the last visit in October 2024. As of April 18, there are 78 boys at Lincoln Hills, 34 youth at Mendota, six girls at Copper Lake, and four at the Grow Academy, according to weekly population reports. The total on-grounds juvenile population is currently 122, up from the 95 who were in custody in early January. 
Average staffing vacancies which typically hovered around 16%-40% were lower, and the monitor stressed the need to address youth on administrative confinement, particularly those waiting to be transferred to another facility. 
Despite the issues, the report found that the Department of Corrections (DOC) is in substantial compliance with 45 (or 90%) of the 50 provisions identified in a court-ordered consent decree that resulted from a 2017 lawsuit over conditions at the youth prison. With the new monitoring report, four more provisions of the consent decree were brought into substantial compliance.
“This report showcases the hard work and commitment of our staff at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake,” said DOC secretary Jared Hoy in a statement. “Tremendous progress has been made over the past seven plus years and we are looking forward to realizing a new model for juvenile corrections in Wisconsin.” The Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center began accepting girls for the first time, allowing the population at Copper Lake to be cut in half. Transfer times for boys were also reduced, and treatment teams have helped youth understand the root causes for anti-social behavior.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The report noted that physical improvements, such as replacing heat exchangers and deck upgrades to training facilities, were made since the last visit. Wifi strength has increased in the school and other living units, making it easier for youth to access recreation and learning programs.
Youth in confinement are provided with a special education teacher, as well as a general education teacher. New classrooms have been added to the Skills Development Programs, and teachers are attending youth growth team meetings and other activities. Some incarcerated youth did complain about teachers not being on the units most of the time, and only receiving paper packet work or chromebooks. A random viewing of video by the monitor showed teachers in the units. Youth also played kickball and were in the music lab during the monitoring visit. The facility still lacks a welding instructor, a program which youth appear to enjoy. The monitor was also concerned about vacancy rates in light of the growing population at Lincoln Hills. 
Living units were clean, and youth interacted with the monitor respectfully. Some housing units weren’t visited because the youth were rambunctious, but all units appeared clean and organized. Youth were calm and talkative with monitoring team members and one another, according to the report. Some played cards, ate lunch, made phone calls or watched television. When interviewed by the monitor, the youth were largely positive. They said they enjoyed new menu items, the music lab, but complained about food portion sizes. They also wished there were more jobs for them to do around the facility, and wanted the kickball unit to be switched to basketball. 
“Some youth stated that staff were abusive, and some youth really liked the staff and said they treated them well,” the monitor wrote. “Youth took pride in how clean their rooms and units were.” There were also complaints about restraints, including  waist belts, that have been used when they are out of their rooms. Youth felt the use of restraints was unfair, and that sometimes they weren’t told when violations were received. 
In 2022, DOC received funding to move forward with a state-run juvenile facility in Milwaukee County. Land was approved on West Clinton Avenue and the design has been  finalized and work began in the summer of 2024. The 32-bed facility is scheduled to be completed in late 2026. Another Type 1 facility is being designed in Dane County. Opening the new facilities will be a major step towards the Legislature’s goal of closing Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake, which have had troubled reputations for abuse and violence against youth housed there as well as staff members.

Wes Moore (D) on Tuesday. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Lawyers representing men and women who were abused as children while in state custody said newly signed legislation will lead to court challenges and a wave of lawsuits over the next five weeks.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders on Tuesday signed House Bill 1378 into law, which will cut in half potential awards to victims that were promised just two years ago in legislation that was hailed for giving survivors another chance to have their day in court.
But that led to claims by thousands of men and women who were sexually abused while in state custody, opening the door to potentially budget-crushing financial awards and sparking the rush to pass HB1378, which takes effect June 1.
D. Todd Mathews, an attorney with Bailey & Glasser, said his firm would be part of a challenge to the new law.
“We will vigorously oppose this clearly unconstitutional bill, in order to protect the Survivors, as the State and Governor Moore have clearly failed them,” Mathews said in an email.
Washington, D.C.-based Bailey & Glasser is one of nearly two dozen firms representing more than 4,500 plaintiffs. The coalition of firms has been in active negotiations with the Maryland Attorney General’s office since 2023.
Mathews and Ryan S. Perlin, an attorney at Baltimore-based Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin, said the newly signed law could face several potential constitutional challenges.
“It’s all but a certainty that this will be challenged,” Perlin said Tuesday morning.
With a June 1 effective date, survivors have until May 31 to file a lawsuit under the old law, which caps damages at $1.5 million per occurrence for private institutions and $890,000 per occurrence against government entities. On June 1, those caps fall to $700,000 and $400,000, respectively.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Perlin said those reductions, as well as the five-week filing window, will likely be challenged, along with the difference in how the law treats lawsuits against private and public institutions.
The bill also caps the fees that can be paid to attorneys representing survivors.
“That will have a chilling effect, making it harder for survivors to find a lawyer who will represent them,” said Perlin, whose firm announced last week that it had filed a new group of lawsuits against Towson-based Calvert Hall College High School under the current law
The bill was one of 142 signed into law at the second ceremony following the 2025 session. That second tranche of new laws included bills affecting expungement of criminal records, the Second Look Act and legislation to aid federal workers whose jobs have been eliminated by President Donald Trump.
Moore did not comment on the Child Victims Act changes during remarks delivered before the bill signing. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the office repeated a statement from last week, that “acknowledged the trauma” survivors have faced, but said the bill would “continue to allow the survivors to seek justice while preserving the long-term fiscal stability of the state.””
Lisae Jordan, executive director and counsel at Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said she hoped the state would make more services available to people who were abused in state facilities.
“House Bill 1378 will save the state a lot of money, but it remains to be seen whether some of the savings will be used to help prevent future abuse or to provide services for survivors who can’t prove their case in court,” Jordan said in an email. “Helping people who were sexually abused while in state custody doesn’t require a lawsuit, but it will require more resources.”
The muted comment at Tuesday’s signing was a vastly different affair than two years ago when Moore praised passage of the Child Victims Act and throngs of survivors traveled to Annapolis for the bill signing.
That 2023 law eliminated time restrictions during which survivors of institutional sexual abuse had to file lawsuits. It also set the $1.5 million and $890,000 caps on awards per “occurrence” of abuse — a term over which plaintiff’s attorneys and some lawmakers disagree.
At the time, the focus was on the substantial number of cases expected to arise out of the Catholic church sex abuse scandal, and the Archdiocese of Baltimore filed for bankruptcy protection in advance of the 2023 law taking effect.
At the same time, hundreds of cases against the state, including the Department of Juvenile Services, began to surface. Lawmakers were warned in January of billions in potential liabilities from an estimated 3,500 cases. Those alone would have dire budgetary consequences.
Since then, a coalition of attorneys has said they have nearly 6,000 cases. And those cases are believed to be just the start.
Two weeks ago, Levy Konigsberg, a New York-based law firm that is part of the coalition, filed lawsuits on behalf of 221 men and women in connection with sexual abuse allegations at 15 state juvenile detention facilities. The lawsuits bring the number of claims handled by Levy Konigsberg alone to roughly 2,000, according to the firm.
Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), who sponsored the 2023 bill, stepped in to author the changes in HB1378, which he called an attempt to ease the potential financial burden to the state while giving survivors the opportunity to seek justice.
“This bill does nothing to change the amounts [government] is going to pay out,” said Perlin, who said lawyers will rush “thousands of cases” to the courthouses in the next five weeks in order to come in under the current, higher caps.
That rush of cases could potentially slow the judicial system and its existing workload of criminal and civil cases to a crawl.
It is likely that victims’ claims and legal challenges to the new law will move simultaneously.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stacey Jernigan approved Prospect Medical Holdings’ plan to begin turning new patients away in Delaware County on Wednesday and to stop providing most services by Friday. 
The emergency departments at Crozer Chester Medical Center in Upland and Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park will stop receiving patients by ambulance but walk-in patients will be accepted for up to a week.
In a hearing on the request, lawyers for a nurses union asked for assurance that the company would pay wages and pension contributions owed since Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
Another lawyer representing several Delaware County municipalities and the school district where one of the hospitals is located argued that the company had not given the required notice that it would stop providing emergency medical and ambulance services. 
“Closing a hospital system of this size is an absolute massive undertaking, and as you would expect, there is chaos, especially given that staff and patients in the community really believed that there would be a hero … stepping up,” Patient Safety Ombudsman Suzanne Koenig testified, adding that the staff remain dedicated to ensuring an orderly transfer of longer-term patients to other facilities.

Prospect has owned Crozer Health System since 2016 and closed two of its four hospitals in recent years as the California-based parent company faced financial peril. On Monday, it notified more than 2,600 employees that it would close its remaining two hospitals. It is one of the largest employers in the county. 
Attorney William Curtin, who represents Prospect in the bankruptcy case, said company officials worked tirelessly with the assistance of the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office to work out a deal to give the hospitals to a new owner in exchange for assuming their liabilities. 
“At the end of the day, your honor, it came down to funding, and there just wasn’t funding there to support a transition or to support a long term future for these hospitals,” Curtin said.
Pennsylvania and the philanthropic organization The Foundation for Delaware County provided more than $40 million in funding to allow the hospitals to continue operations as Prospect negotiated with the University of Pennsylvania to acquire the hospitals.
While Penn offered to inject an additional $5 million for the purchase of certain assets and assumption of leases, it would have also added to Prospect’s debt and the money would not be available until the deal was closed, Curtin said.
“So essentially, the $5 million was going to be too late, and it was unfortunately going to be a bridge to nowhere, because there was … nowhere to go,” he said.
In response to Prospect’s announcement Monday, Delaware County issued an emergency declaration that provides greater flexibility in hiring, procurement, emergency medical services dispatch, and in tracking and potentially recouping expenses related to the ongoing hospital closures. The county filed a motion opposing approval of the closure plan.

“To be clear, Delaware County is extremely disappointed in this outcome, and in the actions of Prospect in every step of this process,” county officials said in a statement. 
Previously owned by Los Angeles-based private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, Prospect was saddled with $1.3 billion debt as its owners took more than $645 million in dividends and fees, according to ProPublica.
Nicole Stallings, president and CEO of the Hospital + Health System Association of Pennsylvania, said that while it is unfortunate that no agreement was reached to allow Crozer to continue operating, hospitals are “consistently called upon to help when access to care is in crisis” and “will undoubtedly step up and take care of those in need regardless of ability to pay.”
She noted that half of the commonwealth’s acute care hospitals operate at a loss, according to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Cost Containment Council. Crozer Health System was losing $12 million a month, according to Prospect.
Stallings said the association is ready to work with policymakers and payors to address the underlying challenges pressuring hospitals and protect Pennsylvanians’ access to care.
The closures will leave Delaware County, with 576,000 people, only two hospitals. It is the fifth most populous county in the commonwealth.
Andrew Costa Kelser, who represents the Philadelphia area health care pension fund and the local affiliate of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, questioned Chief Restructuring Officer Paul Rundell about wages and pension payments.
“I think our first priority right now is patient safety, and we’re focusing on that. And so as I sit here today, I can’t answer anything other than focusing on patient safety issues,” Rundell said.
While Judge Jernigan denied the union’s motion for additional language in the closure plan to assure the payments, she said the question remains a “giant issue” in the resolution of the bankruptcy.
“There’s going to be hell to pay if people don’t get paid their post-petition wages and pension obligations,” Jernigan said. “I’ve gotten assurances from the debtor that these employees will get paid their wages or their salaries as long as they continue to work.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1483938846-gavel-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 21:00:19.030062

Election officials began counting ballots at the Jackson Fire Department’s downtown station after the polls closed at 7 p.m. Turnout in northeast Jackson caught officials by surprise, requiring the delivery of more ballots, which seemed to bode well for Horhn, who carried Ward 1 by wide margins in the April 1 primary.

“This is America,” said Carter, speaking from the South Louisiana ICE processing center, a privately run women’s detention center, where Özturk, a Tufts University student originally from Turkey has been detained since late March. “This is not some communist state.”
Carter was at the Evangeline Parish lockup as part of a congressional delegation that was visiting to observe the living conditions at the facility and meet with immigrants detained there. Along with Öztürk, Carter also met with a constituent, Wendy Brito, a New Orleans-area mother and wife of a U.S. citizen who ICE detained at a routine check-in with the agency.
Joining Carter was U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who has been outspoken against Trump’s immigration policies, and three Democratic lawmakers from Massachusetts —Sen. Edward J. Markey, Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Rep. Jim McGovern — where Öztürk lives.

Khalil and Öztürk’s arrests and detentions have drawn international outcry, with critics accusing the Trump administration of trampling on immigrants’ free speech rights and ignoring the rule of law. Khalil missed the birth of his first child Monday after being denied a temporary release.
Both were in the country legally. Neither has been accused of any crime. But they are now locked up and facing removal. Their arrests are in response only to their political activity. Khalil was involved in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, and Öztürk co-authored a critical op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper.
In the past two months, the Trump administration has targeted several other international students and academics who have participated in pro-Palestinian activities at American universities. Last week, the Louisiana Illuminator reported that the administration has canceled international student visas of more than a dozen people studying at colleges and universities in the state.
“They are setting the foundational floor to violate the due process and free speech of every person who calls this country home, whatever your status is,” Pressley said. “It is shameful and it is a sham … It will not go unchecked.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-23 00:39:23+00:00,CT Mirror,Finance panel backs bill to shrink CT transportation debt,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/finance-panel-backs-bill-to-shrink-ct-transportation-debt/,A key committee OK'd bills that would reduce CT transportation construction debt and phase out property taxes on vehicles — in the 2030s.,"The legislature’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee approved bills Tuesday that would reduce Connecticut transportation construction debt and would gradually phase out property taxes on motor vehicles — in the 2030s.
But even with that long-range strategy, the property tax phase-out faces an uphill struggle, having sparked objections from Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and from the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
The Democratic-controlled finance panel, which must complete action on all its bills by the close of business Thursday, is expected to take up several revenue proposals Wednesday, including a new measure to create a state income tax credit for low- and middle-income families with children.
Those revenue bills, along with a spending plan adopted Tuesday by the Appropriations Committee, will form a blueprint to guide final negotiations with legislative leaders and Lamont on a new state budget for the next two fiscal years.
Capping transportation reserves and paying down debt
One bill, enacted with bipartisan support Tuesday, would cap reserves in the budget’s Special Transportation Fund at 18% of the STF. Any other unspent dollars would be used to pay down transportation debt.
Based on a proposal from state Treasurer Erick Russell, the measure stems from large surpluses in recent years in the transportation fund, which represents about 9% of the $26 billion overall state budget. Besides covering operating expenses for transit programs and for the Departments of Transportation and Motor Vehicles, the fund also pays the debt service — principal and interest — on the hundreds of millions of dollars Connecticut borrows annually for highway, bridge and rail construction projects.
The STF, which gets most of its funding from sales and fuel tax receipts, finished with surpluses approaching or surpassing 10% in each of the past three fiscal years, and the Lamont administration projects a $159 million or 7% surplus this fiscal year.
The STF reserve, which holds these annual surpluses, swelled beyond $970 million last June, according to the state comptroller’s annual reports, a cushion larger than 45% of last year’s entire transportation fund.
Gasoline station owners and fuel distributors began to press state officials to cut gasoline taxes or provide some other relief, given the huge unused revenues.
Legislators agreed to last spring to use $534 million of the reserve to pay down transportation borrowing early — a move Russell projects will save Connecticut $680 million in interest costs over the next decade.
Tax phase-out faces strong objections
The bill approved by the finance committee would maintain the 18% cap permanently and continue to use excess reserves to pay down construction debt.
Majority Democrats adopted a second measure Tuesday over Republican objections that would gradually phase out property taxes on motor vehicles, a levy that generates nearly $1 billion annually for cities and towns. 
But “there will be no revenue loss to the towns,” said Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford, co-chairman of the finance committee.
That plan to keep towns whole hinges on state government continuing to rack up the huge budget surpluses it has averaged since new fiscal caps were established in 2017. The average cushion has been $1.8. billion or 8% of the General Fund.
Legislators have used those surpluses over the past eight years to build the rainy day fund and to make more than $8.5 billion in supplemental pension payments, in addition to the more than $3 billion in required pension contributions it makes annually.
Extra pension payments generate more earnings and slow the growth of the mandatory payments. Lamont’s budget office estimates the state will save $700 million annually on required payments next fiscal year because of all the surplus dollars its dedicated to the pensions since 2020.
But what if those large surpluses and extra pension payments continue in the future? The phase-out bill says that, starting in 2028, any savings on required pension contributions should be redirected toward eliminating the property tax. 
For example, if $100 million in pension savings is achieved, and towns are still collecting $1 billion in property taxes, then the state would have communities reduce that burden to $900 million — and send cities and towns $100 million to offset their revenue loss.
Fonfara conceded this process likely would take many years, but the state has been successfully building big surpluses since 2017.
That savings system, though, has come under increasing criticism from majority Democrats in the House and Senate, who say it has left too few dollars to invest in education, health care, town aid and other core programs.
Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, ranking Senate Republican on the finance committee, said called the municipal levy on motor vehicles “a burdensome tax, an annoying tax, a stupid tax.”
But Fazio, who joined Republicans in voting against the bill, said it hinges on making payments to towns that would be outside of the normal budget process, including the spending cap.
Lamont’s budget director, Jeff Beckham, expressed similar concerns in testimony before the committee.
And the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, which has long argued that the state relies too heavily on property taxes to fund services at the local level, said any plan to end motor vehicle taxes should be part of a more comprehensive reform that gives communities other options for raising revenue.
The municipal lobbying group also has charged, on many occasions, that state government often reneges on pledges to transfer funds to cities and towns, leaving local property taxpayers in the lurch.
“This bill does not reduce the current revenue needs of towns and cities but shifts the burden to the state and makes towns and cities more dependent,” CCM wrote in its testimony.
Other bills adopted Tuesday by the finance committee would:

Establish a 25% tax credit, capped at $500, for businesses that contribute to employees’ Connecticut Higher Education Trust account.


Create business and income tax credits for farming businesses that invest in certain machinery and buildings. The credit is equal to 20% of the amount farmers spend. The measure also would increase the exemption from municipal property taxes for farm machinery from $100,000 of assessed value to $250,000. 


Expand the types of businesses that may earn a state tax credit for making student loan payments on behalf of their employees starting in 2026. The state caps this program and does not issue more than $10 million in credits per year.


Authorize up to $30 million in borrowing in each of the next two fiscal years to create a new program to help municipal school districts renovate or repair public school buildings, grounds and other infrastructure.


Establish a $500 state income tax credit for owners of a licensed family child care home starting in 2026.


Allow cities and towns, starting in October, to expand an existing property tax abatement program for police, firefighters and emergency medical technicians killed in the line of duty. The benefit would also become available to surviving domestic partners of these first responders. The measure also creates a $2,000 state income tax deduction for certain payments to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical service providers.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Tuesday that would require local school boards to develop policies allowing students to leave campus during school hours for religious instruction.
SB 278, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, would mandate that school districts establish procedures for students to attend religious classes off-site for elective credit, provided certain conditions are met. The bill passed 25-6 and moves to the House for consideration.
“We passed a law in Alabama in 2019 allowing school districts to enact policies. Since that time, very few school districts have adopted release time policies … parents are approaching superintendents and school boards throughout the state and are being told no,” Shelnutt claimed as he introduced the bill to the floor.

Under the bill, which Shelnutt framed as a “parental rights and religious freedom bill,” participation in religious instruction would be optional and require parental consent. The bill would mandate that organizations providing instruction provide transportation to and from school and that they be liable if anything happens to a child. The bill would also prohibit local funds from being used to provide religious instruction.
Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, asked about teacher qualifications and program accreditation for the off-site religious classes and whether instructors needed to be certified.
“If I’m Muslim, and I want to go to a mosque to get this done — so the school board has to go speak with the person who’s over the mosque to make sure that they’re accredited and certified in their program?” Singleton asked.
Shelnutt said this would be decided locally, saying “that would be up to the local school board if they want to set their policy.”
This led to further exchanges about whether local boards would vet programs across different faiths, such as instructors at a mosque or various churches. Shelnutt maintained local boards set the policy.
“I’m sure there will be differences in the local school boards and how they set them up,” Shelnutt said when pressed on potential inconsistencies across the state’s 139 districts.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, asked for assurance that local policies could not discriminate against specific religions.
“The policy cannot isolate whether it be the Jehovah Witnesses or whether it be the Seventh Day Adventists or be the Methodists … the policy would have to cover for each of those, is that correct?” Albritton asked. Shelnutt said the policy “cannot be restricted” and parents ultimately choose participation.
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, asked about liability, particularly regarding child safety, referencing past issues within religious institutions. She asked who holds liability under programs if something negative happened to the child.
“A child could break his or her leg or hurt themselves? Who holds that liability? With these off-campus type entities,” Coleman asked.
Shelnutt said that the “sponsoring entity holds all the liability, and the state law already states that,” which would absolve the school system.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, questioned the need for the bill, given existing religious education avenues and school choice laws.
“Why don’t you give the local school board the option to vote this in if they even want to do it for their particular school system?” Figures asked.
Shelnutt maintained they are giving the local school boards “local control” by “giving the local school board control of coming up with the policy.”
Shelnutt also added an amendment before the bill’s passage to ensure that school boards with pre-existing release time policies would not be required to change them, which was adopted 26-4 with one abstention.
A House committee rejected a similar bill earlier this month.

“These cuts, layered on top of previous reductions to research and programmatic funding, would result in the completed elimination of initiatives critical to Utah’s well-being, such as HIV/AIDS prevention, tobacco control, maternal health programs, vaccine distribution efforts, and rural health services,” the Utah Public Health Association said in a news release issued Tuesday.

Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to cut one-third of the Department of Health and Human Services’ discretionary spending, or $40 billion, according to a preliminary budget document the outlet obtained. 
“The 64-page document calls not only for cuts, but also a major shuffling and restructuring of health and human service agencies,” the Washington Post reported. “Agencies are allowed to appeal to HHS for changes but have been told they cannot change the bottom line, according to a federal health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.”
It will ultimately be up to Congress to decide whether to implement the cuts. 
Carrie Butler, executive director of the Utah Public Health Association (a nonprofit that advocates for public health policy), expressed concerns Tuesday that if federal public health budgets are slashed, Utah would feel the impacts — which she said would reverberate beyond public health issues and threaten the state’s economic well-being.
“Utah remains one of the most economically resilient states in the nation, and that strength is directly tied to the health of our population,” Butler said. “When we stop investing in public health — particularly preventive health — we stop investing in our economy.”
Dozens of ‘public health heroes’ laid off across Utah as Trump cuts COVID-19 funds short

Long-term consequences of cutting “prevention and intervention programs are well-documented,” the Utah Public Health Association said, pointing to “untreated chronic disease, higher healthcare costs, reduced workforce productivity, and avoidable human suffering.” 
“The aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic have already made these patterns painfully clear,” the association said. “Data show sharp increases in late-stage cancer diagnoses, delays in diabetes detection, and rising rates of unmanaged chronic disease due to disruptions in preventive care.” 
Butler said Utah health officials are “particularly concerned” about proposed cuts to rural health programs, maternal health services, early childhood education and other “foundational supports that all Utahns rely on — directly or indirectly.” 
“Neglecting these priorities will only shift costs downstream, where we’ll pay more in ER visits, lost workdays, and worse health outcomes overall,” she said. 
The Utah Public Health Association urged state leaders and Utah’s congressional delegation to “speak out against these devastating cuts.” It also urged them to “prioritize sustained investment in the programs that keep our communities healthy and our economy strong.”

Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, advanced 33-16, with all 33 Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature uniting around the measure. LB 89 was introduced on behalf of Gov. Jim Pillen as one of his 2025 priorities.
Kauth said her bill was a “testament” to the ongoing fight for women’s rights and equality, including in sports, and that it was “astounding that women are having to relitigate this discussion to hold on to these hard-fought rights.”
“Women’s rights to privacy, safety and opportunity should never be considered secondary to the rights of men,” Kauth said.

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a nonpartisan progressive, led the opposition to LB 89. She said supporters had a “whole crayon box of life” yet were choosing to use only “two colors” and were acting like “gender cops.”
“Trans kids existing in a restroom in a fourth grade classroom, it doesn’t hurt anyone,” Hunt said. “But forcing them out, singling them out, humiliating them, that does cause harm. We don’t get to legislate someone’s identity just because some people feel uneasy.”
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston filed an amendment seeking to only focus on sports. While it did not come up Tuesday, he and Kauth said they would work together on a path forward ahead of the second-round debate.
Riepe has repeatedly said that if the bill were limited to sports, it would have his support. Thirty-three votes are needed to shut off debate and invoke “cloture” after a set amount of time.
The bill advances to the second of up to three rounds of debate. It will face up to two hours of debate during the second debate.
What the bill would require
Under a proposed committee amendment, adopted 33-11, sex would be defined as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.

Public schools and postsecondary institutions would be required to pass policies complying with the law if they don’t already have such language. Bathrooms and locker rooms would need to be designated as “male” or “female” only, unless they are single occupancy. Family use bathrooms would have been an additional option.
Public school sports would be restricted to students’ sex assigned at birth, for males or females only, unless coed/mixed. There would be an exception if there is no female equivalent team (such as football). Private schools competing against public institutions would need to do the same.
A doctor would need to verify a student’s sex before they could participate in single-sex sports under the amended LB 89.
State agencies would also need to generally enforce any applicable rules, regulations or duties according to someone’s sex, which Pillen already required in a 2023 executive order that he said would continue until a bill passed detailing single-sex requirements for certain services, facilities or sports — such as LB 89.
‘Mind your own business’
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha asked the reverse question to Kauth of young trans children and their families, many of whom he said he met with and feel as though their lives could be “upended.” He said some parents are thinking of leaving Nebraska “to keep their kids alive, to keep their kids in their life, to keep them happy.”

State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha said a sign on a bathroom door would not stop someone who wants to cause harm, and State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha questioned the possible economic consequences of the bill.
“To me, the simple solution is to mind your own business,” said Juarez, a former school board member for Omaha Public Schools. 
Juarez quipped that after the 2025 session, she hopes she doesn’t need 40 hours of therapy, referencing Kauth’s 2023 bill that put in a requirement of “gender-identity-focused” therapy for any minor seeking gender-related care.
Multiple opponents questioned how the bill could be enforced.
‘Level playing field’
Kauth asked what the “magic number” was for how many women or girls needed to feel scared or hurt before the Legislature should act.
“There is no number of women who should be discriminated against,” Kauth said.
State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk said that as his daughters were growing up they weren’t comfortable undressing in the locker room with other girls or one another. He said he didn’t know “how we can say that these other things are fine.”

State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City said LB 89 was not about “exclusion,” which many other supporters echoed.
“It’s about ensuring our daughters, sisters and friends have a level playing field to compete, succeed and shine,” he said.
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said nothing of her support for LB 89 was “rooted in hate or discrimination,” and she walked through major milestones in women’s rights, from the first women’s rights convention in 1848 and the right to vote in 1920 to the Equal Pay Act in 1963 and the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.
“I stand in support of LB 89 not because I hate anybody,” Storer said. “But I stand here in honor of the women that came before me.”
State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the Education Committee chair, said differences between male and female student-athletes were “settled,” pointing to Nebraska high school track and field records online. He said Title IX, prohibiting sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding, required federal action. 
‘It’s not that easy’
Riepe and Tom Brandt of Plymouth, Republicans who declined to vote for a narrower proposal limited to K-12 sports and spaces in 2024, did so this time around.
Brandt had previously voiced concern that the 2024 version did not cover parents of young children or caregivers of people with disabilities who were not the same sex. LB 89 provides an additional exception to the bathroom requirements in these cases.
Riepe, throughout the 2025 session, has swung between “leaning” for or against the bill and in January had described himself as a “doubting Thomas” for the bill.
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
On Tuesday, Riepe said his amendment was a “personal compromise” that addressed his shared concern of “preserving” the integrity of interscholastic K-12 sports. However, he said he didn’t think that concern justified using state law to “micromanage” bathrooms or locker rooms and that expecting beer leagues beyond interscholastic was “unreasonable.”
He said the agency section in the bill “opens a can of worms” that lawmakers needed to further understand. Kauth has said the intention is, for example, prison housing assignments.
“‘Standing with women,’ it sounds strong, it sounds so American, but it’s not that easy, and it’s much more serious and much more complicated,” Riepe said. 
Riepe added that an “attorney friend” of his last week told him: “When it comes to equal rights, your equity ends where my freedom begins.”
If the bill is not narrowed during the second-round debate, Riepe said he is “prepared” to oppose LB 89. That would likely require Kauth to substitute a placeholder amendment she has with Riepe’s language. If progressives block that process, he said he would vote for the bill without his amendment.
‘Strike a balance’
The federal landscape was also very different this time around compared to 2024, with President Donald Trump and his officials threatening to pull federal funding if schools allowed transgender students to participate in sports according to their gender identity, not sex.

In response, both the Nebraska School Activities Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association decided to restrict sports participation to student-athletes’ sex assigned at birth.
The Nebraska association, for example, had a nearly decade-old rigorous Gender Participation Policy that would allow transgender students to apply if they could, in effect, prove their gender identity. Trans girls also had to demonstrate that they had no “physiological advantage” and had started hormone treatments or completed sex-reassignment surgery.
Fewer than 10 students had applied for participation under the NSAA policy before its “indefinite” end earlier this year, after Trump’s order. Supporters said just one student was “one too many” if it jeopardized other students’ opportunities or privacy.
Riepe was among senators who favored the NSAA route, and multiple state senators had proposed putting the requirements into law, including State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln.
Kauth has repeatedly said that executive orders can be overturned and that the NSAA guidelines were not adequate.
“LB 89 aims to strike a balance between fairness, safety and equality,” Kauth said. “It’s a thoughtful and necessary measure that reaffirms the rights of women and girls in Nebraska to opportunity, privacy and safety.”

Republican Rep. Mark White of East Memphis, chairman of the House Finance Committee, said House and Senate versions approved earlier in the day were too far apart for passage.
The Tennessee Legislature adjourned for the year Tuesday evening without taking further action on the bills.
One of the key sticking points was that the Senate bill was amended to enable an advisory board to select replacements for elected Memphis board members removed by the state, a provision considered unconstitutional. It differed from the House version.
White said he wants a “strong oversight board” and that a compromise would weaken the measure. He declined to have competing House and Senate measures sent to a conference committee to work out a compromise.
Tennessee lawmakers file Memphis Shelby Schools “hostile takeover” at last minute

“We prefer we keep the bill alive,” White said, adding he would work on the legislation through the summer and bring it back next year for consideration.
The House and Senate passed separate bills Tuesday creating a management group to oversee Memphis Shelby County Schools despite complaints that setting up a “takeover” board could prove to be unconstitutional.
White’s decision came as the legislature moved toward adjournment for the year.
Earlier, White told colleagues the change is needed after decades of poor performance by the school district and board, including a billion dollars in deferred maintenance and under-used buildings despite a $1.8 billion budget.
The advisory board, which would be funded locally instead of by the state, would supersede the elected board on budgets, contracts exceeding $50,000 and some policy. Under one plan, it would be responsible for reviewing the entire system and making an improvement plan.
Separately, the legislature approved $6 million for a forensic audit of the school district. But Republicans, who hold supermajorities in the House and Senate, refused requests to complete the audit before embarking on the new format.
Later, White said waiting a year would enable the audit to move forward before an advisory board is created.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, who carried the Senate version of the bill, laid most of the blame for poor performance on school board members, saying students are “hanging in there like a crackhead’s last tooth.”
White and Taylor denied the plan is a “takeover,” with Taylor instead describing it as “a list of cascading interventions” 



Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County, who carried the Senate version of the bill, laid most of the blame for poor performance on school board members, saying students are “hanging in there like a crackhead’s last tooth.” 


Votes in both chambers didn’t come without opposition from Memphis lawmakers who said the state should allow voters to select new school board members, instead of giving the state’s education commissioner authority to remove board members and the district director. 
Democratic Sen. London Lamar of Memphis was among numerous Shelby County lawmakers who spoke out against the measure. In response to Taylor, she said, “Memphis is not the last tooth in a crack addict’s mouth.”
Lamar and other Shelby lawmakers compared the plan to the state’s Achievement School District, which is being phased out after a decade and more than a billion dollars spent. They also accused the state of usurping local voters.
“It’s not our job to take the power away from the local school board,” Lamar said.
Lamar later called the outcome a “victory for local control.”
Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson of Memphis, a consistent critic of the Achievement School District for five-plus years, said the bill’s provision allowing the state to turn schools over to charter operators shows that the plan is designed to benefit hedge funds and corporations.
Shelby County school systems have gone through several stages in the last decade, including dissolution of Memphis City Schools and creation of suburban districts such as Collierville and Arlington, all of which left Memphis Shelby County Schools with a large concentration of low-income students.

The Memphis Shelby County School Board also removed its director recently, creating more conflict within the district and giving lawmakers ammunition to single out the school system, even though the bills applied to schools statewide.
Republican Rep. Kevin Vaughan of Collierville in Shelby County told colleagues he had shifted views after initially thinking lawmakers should wait until the audit is complete before taking action.
“We’ve got to turn the ship around in southwest Tennessee,” Vaughan said. “We’re doing a disservice to children who are not getting a fair shake.”
The legislation also lifted income caps on the Education Savings Account program in Shelby to enable more families to qualify for funds to enroll children in private schools. Recipients can use about $9,500 in state funds to go toward tuition.
Democratic state Sen. Jeff Yarbro predicted such a move would cause confusion and lead to a lawsuit.

Proposed state cuts may halt that growth,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/04/student-enrollment/,"The UC has grown its enrollment of California undergraduates by 16,000 in the last five years. University officials say they won’t be able to continue that growth if state funding is cut.","In summary
The UC has grown its enrollment of California undergraduates by 16,000 in the last five years. University officials say they won’t be able to continue that growth if state funding is cut.


The University of California will enroll fewer new California students if planned state cuts are implemented, college officials told state lawmakers during a hearing today on the system’s finances.  
“University of California cannot afford to continue increasing enrollment with less funding, it just can’t,” said UC’s top academic officer, Katherine Newman, at an Assembly budget subcommittee hearing. “If the state cuts the university by 8%, we will be forced to decrease enrollment for the fall of 2026 admission cycle.” 
The comments are the strongest indication yet that the proposed budget cuts for UC and the California State University that lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom agreed to last year may limit the ability of new students to enter California’s public universities. The fiscal belt-tightening  is a response to forecasted multi-billion-dollar deficits in California. For UC, the proposed state cuts add to the climate of fiscal uncertainty: The Trump administration has sought to lower the system’s federal research funding by hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

UC faces half-billion-dollar budget shortfall and increases tuition for new nonresident students 

by Mikhail Zinshteyn 





The UC has grown its enrollment of California undergraduates by 16,000 in the last five years, fueled by a swell of state cash as lawmakers grapple with voters’ demands to open more seats at the state’s marquee public higher-education system. The Legislature has also in recent years been adding $30 million annually to UC’s state support so that it enrolls fewer out-of-state students and more in-state students at its three most popular campuses, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego. That funding is at risk of being deferred in 2025-26.“So blowing up class sizes, reducing advising, limiting opportunities for our students: This is not a recipe for the continued success at the University of California, and we would not want to go in that direction,” Newman said. If the UC ends its enrollment growth, it won’t happen until next year. That’s because the UC has already admitted students for the coming fall term.While other state agencies were cut by nearly 8% cut in last year’s budget, UC and Cal State were given a year to plan for their share of the permanent cuts. Those would total roughly $770 million annually if lawmakers and Newsom agree to them this June as part of negotiations for the 2025-26 budget. UC’s share would be about $400 million.But an Assembly legislative analysis calculated that other state agencies are experiencing much lower cuts — around 2% or 3%. As a result, the proposed cuts to UC and Cal State would represent more than half of the $1.5 billion in state spending decreases planned for 2025-26 in Newsom’s January budget proposal. About 50 members of the Assembly signed letters opposing the proposed university cuts, the meeting agenda said. Legislative budget leaders also sounded the alarm on the cuts in February in a letter to Newsom’s Department of Finance. 
“However, given numerous General Fund pressures facing the state, it is unclear whether the Legislature will have the ability to restore the cuts,” the agenda for today’s hearing said.The chair of the Assembly’s budget subcommittee on education finance, David Alvarez, a Democrat from Chula Vista, asked UC senior officials how much the state could cut and still leave student academics largely unaffected, including graduation rates and other endeavors that “ensure that student access remains the same.”
For UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, the answer was about $30 million, much less than the roughly $73 million in state cuts the campus would absorb under the current plan.  Systemwide, the UC’s 10 campuses could tolerate an ongoing cut of $125 million, said Seija Virtanen, a UC government relations official.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washingtonians’ medical debt will not be included in their credit reports, under a bill signed into law on Tuesday. 
Having medical debt can create a spiraling effect and prevent people from getting approved for car or home loans or apartment rentals. Medical debt can also cause providers to deny services to patients with outstanding bills or dissuade people from seeking care. 
Senate Bill 5480, sponsored by Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, intends to mirror efforts at the federal level that have been thrown into question. It will prohibit collection agencies from reporting overdue medical debt to credit agencies. The bill will take effect on July 27. 
In January, the Biden administration finalized a similar federal rule before President Donald Trump took office. It was set to take effect in March, but it is currently on pause by the Trump administration and faces legal challenges. 
The new state law is intended to help people like Christopher Raymond, who was diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma at age 16. 
To get the treatment Raymond needed to survive, his dad was forced to retire and cash out his pension, which amounted to $60,000. 
Originally from Everett, Raymond’s family moved to California so he could receive the treatment he needed, which lasted two years and required a stem cell transplant, which was not covered by his dad’s insurance. The move made him eligible for Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, which covered his treatments. 
Despite the coverage, he and his family faced extreme hardships and had trouble paying for necessities such as food and utilities. 
“There was a point where it got really bad that I was eating those quarter chicken legs you would get from the grocery store and it would be my only meal I could have for the day,” Raymond said. 
Raymond is now 28 and has been cancer-free for the past 10 years, but says his family could’ve been pushed into extreme debt for his treatments, which cost upward of $6 million before accounting for insurance payments. 
“I shouldn’t be punished for having cancer,” Raymond said. 
His experience is shared by many who have undergone similar health issues. 
When this happens, people might stop or delay treatments because they can’t afford them or because their insurance companies don’t approve the care. People, at times, also lose everything they own to continue their treatments, or they end up dying of cancer. 
Roughly six in 10 Washington adults say they could not pay an unexpected $500 medical bill, and about 30% say they live in a household with medical debt, even with health insurance, according to a report done by the Northwest Health Law Advocates. 
Audrey Miller García, government relations director at the American Cancer Society, explained that families can still have to pay debt they accrued from treatments if their child dies of cancer.
Even when someone survives cancer, they may still need treatment for the rest of their lives. These follow-up treatments are expensive, and depending on the insurance coverage a person has, the care can land them in thousands of dollars worth of debt. 
Raymond still gets billed.
“My lifelong care after cancer is always going to be met with more insurance bills,” he said. 
He says he’s been due for a CT scan for over six years, but is worried about going into debt because he cannot afford the scan even after his co-pay. 
“You shouldn’t be punished for having cancer, you should get through it and be able to not worry about having to live, because it’s not enough to just survive, you need to live too,” Raymond said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1724-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 20:05:36.969953

(Courtesy of Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council)A 600-foot-long rock wall built without permission along the shoreline of Quidnessett Country Club became the signature criticism of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council last year.
But as environmental advocates hammered the coastal agency for contemplating the country club’s retroactive request for forgiveness — which the council eventually denied — a Warwick property owner’s own illegal seawall escaped similar public outrage.
A hearing Tuesday before the CRMC thrust the spotlight onto Sali Siharaj, who built a shoreline retaining wall along his property overlooking Greenwich Bay two years ago, without permission from coastal regulators. Despite multiple written warnings, two separate threats of fines totaling $18,000, and multiple meetings with CRMC staff, the illegal stone wall still stands.
North Kingstown country club on rocky terrain in quest to keep illegal wall

Which is how what has been an administrative enforcement case till now has risen to the attention by the 10-member, politically appointed council. 
The council voted Tuesday to require Siharaj, and his real estate company, ODI Realty LLC, to bring his property in compliance with state coastal regulations. The enforcement order offers a 45-day window for Siharaj to submit a restoration plan that would tear down the existing stone wall and restore vegetation, or else face financial penalties.  
The council’s unanimous vote doesn’t actually preclude Siharaj from having any kind of protection against shoreline erosion on his property. After removing the existing, illegal wall, Siharaj can opt to proceed with what coastal regulators have determined is an appropriate protection against shoreline erosion: a “hybrid” wall with stone on the bottom and vegetation on top.
Unlike the Quidnessett property, which borders the most environmentally sensitive type of state waters where any permanent structures on the shoreline are prohibited, regulations governing the shoreline abutting Siharaj’s property near Buttonwoods Beach are not so stringent. Some development is allowed, but it must first be reviewed and approved to meet with state coastal requirements.
CRMC staff originally suggested the hybrid alternative when Siharaj first applied in 2022 for a permit for shoreline work at his Budlong Farm Road property. But before Brian Harrington, CRMC senior environmental scientist, finished reviewing the application, Siharaj hired contractors to begin clearing vegetation, landscaping, excavating, and building a stone wall.
Enforcing state coastal regulations more broadly has been a pain point for the state coastal agency, highlighted in an April 10 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA’s report blamed agency staffing shortages for the “varied” enforcement success over a five-year review period. It recommended additional hires — an agency request which has gone unanswered in recent state budget years — as well as developing an online permitting system to streamline and track enforcement.
“It takes the agency a long time to work these cases through the process,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview prior to the hearing Tuesday. “I think more than anything, it speaks to lack of enforcement capacity at the CRMC.”
According to letters to the CRMC from his attorney, Siharaj was unaware he needed CRMC approval before work could begin, and was out of the country when construction was happening. 
Thorp was skeptical of the plea of ignorance.
“Even if coastal property owners don’t know coastal rules, most contractors doing the work are pretty well aware,” Thorp said. 
Council member Kevin Flynn questioned why CRMC staff had not taken enforcement measures against the contractor, who continued to excavate and build the stone wall on Siharaj’s property, along with a separate, also illegal wall on his neighbor’s section of shoreline, despite being told to stop.
“A contractor who willingly ignores cease and desist orders is part of the problem to me,” Flynn said during the meeting.
Anthony DeSisto, the outside counsel for the CRMC, responded that the property owner, not the contractor, is responsible for violations of state coastal regulations.

Missed deadlines
Siharaj was allegedly brought up-to-speed on the infraction by November 2023, when his former attorney, Paul DeMarco, met with Harrington to work out a resolution, Harrington told the council during a Feb. 11 hearing on the case. They agreed to have Siharaj and his contractors submit a new restoration plan for the shoreline to coastal regulators by April 2024, with work to be completed the following month. Extended deadlines went unanswered. Siharaj’s engineer finally submitted a plan on Feb. 7, 2025, days before a Feb. 11 hearing on the case before the full council.
The council agreed to postpone any enforcement action by 60 days to give agency staff time to review the recently submitted engineering documents.
The plan by Warwick-based Joe Casali Engineering Inc. did not meet the agreed-upon terms of restoring the shoreline and revising the rock wall to a hybrid stone-vegetation mix. Instead, the engineering proposal sought an after-the-fact approval for the stone wall as-is, according to an April 22 written addendum from Harrington.
Subsequent requests by coastal regulators to submit an appropriate restoration plan went unanswered, according to Harrington’s report. 










A contractor who willingly ignores cease and desist orders is part of the problem to me.

“The staff gives applicants the benefit of the doubt,” Thorp said. “Oftentimes, they try to be accommodating, to work with applicants and their attorneys as best they can to resolve things without having to go to enforcement. Unfortunately, that sometimes results in more back and forth, in hindsight, than should have been allowed.”
Mary Shekarchi, a Warwick attorney and sister of House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, is now representing Siharaj. She told the council at its hearing Tuesday that she was unable to reach Siharaj for weeks despite multiple attempts and forms of communication. She finally made contact with his son last week, and learned Siharaj was out of the country. Another, unnamed representative from ODI Realty signaled willingness to comply with state coastal regulations and instead build an environmentally appropriate hybrid retaining wall, Shekarchi said.
 Joe Casali, principal of the engineering firm with his name, will be submitting a plan for the alternative shortly, Casali told the council Tuesday.
The “deconstruction” proposal is being coordinated with the engineer for Siharaj’s neighbors, who must similarly restore the shoreline and take down their own illegal stone wall. Because the two barriers are connected, built by the same contractor, it makes sense to coordinate restoration efforts, Shekarchi said. 
Siharaj did not attend the meeting, and could not be reached for comment. City tax records show he bought the three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath house for $365,000 in November 2010, transferring it to his real estate company, ODI Realty LLC, for $0 in December of the same year. The property was valued at $744,700 as of 2024.
Three miles south at Quidnessett, the rock wall remains, despite the council’s January denial of its attempt to reclassify the waters — a workaround which could have allowed for a permanent barrier. Coastal regulators are still reviewing the required restoration plan to return the shoreline to its original state.
Thorp remained adamant that the best solution to inadequate and protracted enforcement action was to overhaul the agency completely, getting rid of the politically appointed council and empowering the staff with final decision-making power.
“The council would have been justified in starting enforcement action tonight,” Thorp said in an interview after the meeting. “They already gave an extension back in February. The more enforcement actions like this get delayed and delayed, it takes away some of the deterrent effect of enforcement.”

,DC,2025-04-22 23:40:53+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,FDA seeks to phase out 8 common food dyes,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fda-seeks-phase-out-8-common-food-dyes,,"WASHINGTON — Trump administration health officials announced Tuesday they hope to eliminate eight petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply before the end of next year, though they haven’t received guarantees or written agreement from food companies.Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary detailed efforts to phase out the dyes during a press conference alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the department’s Washington, D.C., headquarters.“Let's be honest, taking petroleum-based food dyes out of the food supply is not a silver bullet that will instantly make America's children healthy, but it is one important step,” Makary said.The FDA’s proposal would revoke authorization for Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B while setting up the agency to work ""with industry to eliminate"" Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1 and Blue No. 2.FDA will also authorize new, natural food dyes in the months ahead.Kennedy said the Trump administration has an “understanding,” but not an “agreement” with food companies that use the dyes, before deferring to Makary, who said that “you win more bees with honey than fire.”“There are a number of tools at our disposal. And so I believe in love, and let's start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes,” Makary said. “But we are exploring every tool in the toolbox to make sure this gets done very quickly. And they want to do it. They want to do it.“So why go down a complicated road with Congress when they want to do this? They don't want to deal with the patchwork of 30 different state plans.”Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president of public affairs and communications at the National Confectioners Association, released a written statement that didn’t appear to agree entirely with the FDA’s proposed phase-out, however. “FDA and regulatory bodies around the world have deemed our products and ingredients safe, and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue,” Gindlesperger wrote. “We are in firm agreement that science-based evaluation of food additives will help eliminate consumer confusion and rebuild trust in our national food safety system.”Removing additivesDuring the press conference, Makary held up watermelon, beet and carrot juices in clear containers, encouraging food companies to use those as dye, instead of the ones that may be removed from the market.“We are simply asking American food companies to replace petroleum-based food dyes with natural ingredients for American children, just as they already do for children in other countries,” he said. “American children deserve good health.”Makary said he believes there are several health conditions associated with petroleum-based synthetic dyes in food, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, cancer, genomic disruption, gastrointestinal issues, and allergic reactions.Kennedy said his goal as HHS secretary is to remove all additives in food served in schools “that we can legally address.”The department, Kenedy said, will also work with Congress and President Donald Trump to increase labeling for food ingredients that Kennedy called addictive, including sugar.“There's things that we'll never be able to eliminate, like sugar. And sugar is poison and Americans need to know that,” Kennedy said. ""It is poisoning us. Is giving us a diabetes crisis.”Health effects unclearMartin Bucknavage, senior food safety extension associate at Penn State University, said during an interview with States Newsroom that petroleum-based synthetic food dyes are derived just to get the color.“It's not like it's just a nasty chemical that they're putting in there,” he said. “It's something that's been taken, it's been chemically made, modified and then purified, so that it is just that chemical that provides that color. And then those colors have been studied.”Similar to the complicated nature of nutrition studies — which can have a challenging time separating out a person’s genetics, exercise and environmental factors from one specific part of their diet — research on food dyes hasn’t been conclusive, Bucknavage said.“In some cases, it does have an impact on hypersensitivity, but not in all cases,” he said. “And not all studies are basically showing the same thing. So there's a lot of variability that exists out there.""And I'm not saying, 'Listen, we shouldn't go through and study these things more and get better information on them.' We certainly should. But again, it's not an easy thing to do. Some of these studies take time and take a lot of money and sometimes the results are kind ... more variable in terms of the results.”States regulating dyesThe FDA’s announcement wasn’t the first time the federal government or state lawmakers have sought to ban food additives or synthetic dyes.The Biden administration announced in January that the federal government would ban Red No. 3 in food beginning in 2027 and from medicines in 2028. Makary said during the press conference Tuesday the current administration plans to ask companies to phase out that dye sooner.California lawmakers approved a bill in 2023 that will ban Red No. 3, propylparaben, brominated vegetable oil and potassium bromate from food starting in 2027.The following year, legislators in the Golden State approved another measure that, starting in 2028, will ban six food dyes — Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 — from being sold in schools.Those two state laws followed the California Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment releasing a report in 2021 that concluded “scientific literature indicates that synthetic food dyes can impact neurobehavior in some children.”Virginia lawmakers approved legislation earlier this year that Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed in March to ban some artificial food dyes in public schools, starting in July 2027.In deeply red West Virginia, Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill a few days later that will prevent seven artificial dyes from being sold in grocery stores starting in 2028 or included in school lunches starting in August.Arizona and Utah have implemented laws of their own addressing food dyes.The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on strengthening health standards, reports that legislators in several states, including Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington have introduced bills that could ban certain food dyes or chemicals.Melanie Benesh, EWG vice president for government affairs, wrote in a statement about the FDA announcement that the federal agency “has known for decades that synthetic food dyes are linked to health problems, particularly in children, but has failed to act.”“We’re pleased the administration is following the lead of states like California and West Virginia by finally announcing their intent to ban dyes,” Benesh wrote. “We’re grateful that states like California and West Virginia have forced the FDA to make food safety a bigger priority.”Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the self-described food and health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest, wrote in a statement released Monday that Americans ""don’t need synthetic dyes in the food supply, and no one will be harmed by their absence.""“The most important thing to know about food dyes is that their only purpose is to make food companies money,” Lurie wrote. “They are purely cosmetic, serving no nutritional function. In other words, food dyes help make ultra-processed foods more attractive, especially to children, often by masking the absence of a colorful ingredient, like fruit.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-04-22 20:05:36.969953

A national investment firm has pledged to open a $2.8 billion computing center in South Carolina’s Upstate.
NorthMark Strategies inked a deal with Spartanburg County to bring its supercomputing operations to a former Kohler manufacturing plant and warehouse.
“Of the more than 100 locations across the country we considered, Spartanburg stood out for its strong community, skilled workforce, dynamic economy and strategic advantages,” NorthMark Strategies President Jen Byrne said in a statement. “Our investment in this high-performance computing center solidifies our commitment to building for future growth and being prepared to meet the growing demand for (high performance computing) capabilities.”
The company plans to transform the facility into “one of the most advanced (high performance computing) facilities in the world, leveraging cutting-edge technology to support complex computational tasks in machine learning, data analytics, and complex systems modeling.”
A $2.8B computing center proposed in the Upstate would generate its own electricity

The project, previously referred to publicly as “Project Moc-1” while the deal was negotiated, comes as South Carolina grapples with how to meet the energy needs of a growing population, manufacturing base and an influx of power heavy data centers.
These data centers, housing rows of servers, are focused on the storage of vast amount of data. High performance computing, on the other hand, is about analyzing large amounts of data, which would cause a typical computer to freeze up, at high speeds.
It can do this multiple ways, either with the use of a custom-built supercomputer or a cluster of individual computers all working together, to give the user more computing power than a standard, single computer. North Carolina State University, for example, offers one such cluster.
NorthMark’s clients turn to the company with their complex engineering problems. NorthMark’s computing centers power the company’s various simulation and artificial intelligence tools that its clients can use to design and troubleshoot whatever they need.
“We don’t just fund ideas — we help test, refine, and improve them,” according to NorthMark’s website.
“With NorthMark Strategies establishing operations in Spartanburg County, South Carolina continues to add to its already impressive technology industry. We celebrate this remarkable investment in the Upstate and all it will mean for our state and our people,” Secretary of Commerce Harry Lightsey said in a statement.
NorthMark’s center will be different from massive centers under construction by Google and Facebook parent company Meta in a second way.
Those centers each require hundreds of megawatts to operate.
But NorthMark will connect to a nearby natural gas pipeline and use the fuel to make its own power, County Councilman David Britt previously told the SC Daily Gazette. The center is not expected to use more energy than the site’s former tenant, Kohler, which closed in 2024 after 66 years.
While the reported investment figure is immense — the second largest single investment in state history — the company will employ just 27 full-time workers. NorthMark has not disclosed what these jobs will be or the potential salary for these positions.
$15M effort to train SC students on supercomputers starts at USC

To lure in the company, Spartanburg County offered a reduced property tax rate of 4% for 40 years.
By state law, manufacturers without such an arrangement pay a 6% rate. (Industrial property owners previously paid a 10.5% rate, but state laws passed in 2017 and 2022 effectively lowered it to 6%.)
The county also is offering special credits allowing the company to further buy down its tax bill — a $1.5 million annual credit for the first 20 years and $2 million for the 20 years after that.
NorthMark is not seeking any tax incentives or grants from the state, according to a company spokeswoman.
The company is renovating the facility in three phases, starting with a 350,000-square-foot former warehouse on site and ending with the former 500,000-square-foot manufacturing plant.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 20:05:36.969953

They were hunting for garlic mustard, a fast-growing invasive species, as part of an Earth Day trash bash organized by Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation.
Erica Place, communications and outreach manager for the foundation, said instead of human-generated trash, the group was hunting for “garbage plants.” 
The invasive species has been reported in almost all states and across Canada, but was originally introduced to North America as an herbal antiseptic and erosion controlling plant, according to The Nature Conservancy. 
Garlic mustard, sometimes called poor man’s mustard or hedge garlic, emerges early in the spring, which allows it to outcompete other plant species. 
This leads to a loss of plant biodiversity and the destruction of forest ecosystems, not only from the plant’s above-ground growth, but also from a toxin in its roots that can inhibit soil fungi.

Areas with garlic mustard invasion had not been identified at Brenton Slough, a more than 1,100-acre property purchased by INHF in partnership with Polk County Conservation, which meant volunteers were also on a scavenger hunt for the plants. 
“You would be hard-pressed to enter any Iowa woodlands and not find garlic mustard,” Place said to volunteers before they hiked further into the slough to begin their hunt.
Garlic mustard has round, somewhat crinkly leaves with lots of veins and, per its name, a pungent garlic aroma. In the first year of its life cycle, the plants are small “rosettes” on the ground, but in the second year, they send up a tall stalk with white flowers and prolific seeds. 
The plant looks similar to common blue violets and stinging nettle, which volunteers found plenty of on their first pass through a forested area. 
 
It’s edible
Many foragers will pull garlic mustard and use it to make things like pesto, pastas, or stir fries.


“This is one of those things where you want to find some to feel accomplished, but it’s a good thing not to find any,” Place said and led the group to a different area of the slough to keep looking. 
Most of the volunteers chose to participate because their workplaces incentivized volunteer hours, and they decided to cash in on an opportunity that brought them outdoors on a pleasant Tuesday afternoon.
Kate Davies, a volunteer from Des Moines, has participated in several “trash bash” events put on by the City of Des Moines, and said she enjoys being involved in conservation work. As a mother to two children, she said she wants to make sure the nature she enjoys will “still be around” when her children are older. 
Joe Jayjack, the external affairs director for INHF, said volunteer events like this accomplish two main goals. Practically, it takes a big group of people to do the work of pulling and identifying invasive plants like garlic mustard or honeysuckle. He said the events also bring people out to the natural spaces around them.

“And it helps people care,” Jayjack said. “I think the more that people learn about these things, the more they’re likely to care about protecting special spaces like this.” 
Most of the volunteers were at Brenton Slough for the first time. Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation is finishing raising a total of $8 million in order to transfer the land over to Polk County Conservation. INHF bought the property from the Brenton family with the intention of holding it until it could raise enough money to transfer the property to the county conservation group, who will maintain and open the reserve to the public. 
“It’s a really really interesting place,” Jayjack said. “The slough is kind of a wetland ecosystem. It backwaters off of Beaver Creek and it’s just amazing for water quality … and for wildlife habitat.” 
Jayjack said the plan is to keep the area pretty wild, with minimal infrastructure of a parking lot and some mown trails. 
Walking around the slough, volunteers found garlic mustard beginning to carpet the forest floor. They pulled what was possible, making sure to bring up the roots as well to fully kill the plant, and Place noted the areas with garlic mustard infestation. 
“That’ll be really helpful for Polk County Conservation to concentrate their efforts when they take control of the property,” Place said to volunteers.

More clean up events
Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation has volunteer events throughout the year, but several upcoming events will remove garlic mustard and other “garbage plants” from wildlife areas near Pella and Waukon. 
Central Iowans can also participate in trash bash events, organized by the City of Des Moines, through the end of the week in areas around the metro. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources encourages Iowans to celebrate Arbor Day on Friday by planting trees or learning about the tree species around them. 
DNR has a registry of some of the biggest trees in the state and resources on identifying the most common trees in Iowa. 
Additionally, the department has residential tree distribution events in Greenfield, Iowa Falls and DeWitt, where Iowans can purchase landscape-sized trees at an extreme discount.

(Photo by Darren Cooper/Getty Images)The legislative-mandated search for efficiency in Utah universities is already changing how campuses are conducting work and the faces in their staff and faculty rosters. 
The budget cuts have also led one institution to part ways with programs that have lately been controversial in academia, including ethnic studies, women and gender studies, and queer studies.
Gearing up for a May deadline to present “strategic reinvestment” plans, Weber State University shared in a town hall on Monday with faculty and staff a preliminary path to cut the necessary $6.6 million to comply with HB265, a recent law requiring Utah universities to cut 10% of their instructional budget to later invest in other high-demand areas.

The Weber State plans are still unofficial, but are contemplating terminating 11 administrative positions, 10 staff roles, and 28 faculty in addition to closing its West Center, which offered testing services, tutoring and computer labs. 
The plans also entail eliminating 89 courses to save about $285,000.
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

Early on, when HB265 was just a proposal, Weber State University president Brad Mortensen formed a committee to develop quantitative and qualitative criteria to assess programs, Bryan Magaña, a spokesperson for the institution, said on Tuesday. 
“Data sets looked at a variety of factors: number of majors, number of graduates, retention outcomes, faculty-to-student ratio, median income of graduates in each field, projected job growth in each field, and much more,” Magaña wrote in an email. 
Majors to be eliminated include different language programs, like French, German, and a professional and technical emphasis of the school’s bachelor in English. Also some science programs will be cut, according to the plans, including applied environmental geosciences, applied physics and mathematics. 
There are also seven certificates that may be discontinued, including biotechnician, ethics, facilities management, jazz studies and music entrepreneurship. 
Meanwhile, eight minors are set to be eliminated — ethnic studies, French for the professions, German for the professions, linguistics, public administration, queer studies, Spanish for the professions, and women and gender studies. 
The ultimate decision is up to the university president, Magaña said. “However, he sought insight and worked closely with the deans of each college, who looked at their own efficiencies and assessed programs based on the detailed models provided by the HB 265 Committee.”
Some other majors and departments are to be consolidated — the school is planning on having six economics majors instead of four, combining the elementary education and special education programs.
Utah is planning on cutting inefficient college programs — some Republicans are not fully on board

Weber State is also creating three secondary teaching majors to consolidate what were previously 31 separate programs — the new secondary science education major would encompass physics, chemistry, physical science, biology composite and Earth science teaching programs; a new social science composite education major would consolidate political science, sociology, geography, psychology and history teaching; and the new world languages education major would include French, German and Spanish teaching. 
According to the presentation, the funds cut in this effort may later be used to partner with technical colleges, collaborate in academic programs “that respond to workforce and societal needs,” develop new credential programs, and create additional systems to increase online course offerings. Also, to hire new faculty for “high-yield” programs and other student success initiatives.
14 programs at USU may face the same fate
Utah State University has to make a reallocation plan for $12.6 million of its budget for courses, a task the institution has been aggressively pursuing. 
The university declined to speak about the cuts until the plans are final. However, on a strategic reinvestment website, the institution made a list of the first 14 programs that may be affected in the reallocation process.



Let us know what you think...


 


Most of the programs on the list are part of the university’s EEJ College of Education and Human Services, including programs on ASL interpretation or teaching programs, as well as community and public health, family life studies, rehabilitation transition, and psychology data science and research methodology. 
Other programs include environmental engineering, theater, national environmental policy act and agriculture communication. 
“Decisions to discontinue educational activities have been based on an iterative, data-informed process with specific focus on the criteria in HB 265, contextual information offered through the deans and USU community feedback, and USU’s anticipated strategic direction for reinvestment,” the website reads.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerOn the first Earth Day in 1970, pockets of student groups and activists organized more than 12,000 teach-ins and events across the country that marked the beginning of a new era of federal environmental regulations, like the Clean Air Act, and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.Fifty-five years later, the holiday has become more corporate than radical, but to Ethan Tapper, who gave the devotional address to the House of Representatives Tuesday morning, the day is still an important opportunity to recognize that past and all the work that lies ahead.“I think of Earth Day as this ritual where we honor the people who have given us the legacies,  the good environmental legacies that we now stand on,” Tapper said in an interview. Tapper, a true Vermont multi-hyphenate is a forester and author who has amassed a social media following of more than 47,000 on Instagram and TikTok for his casual explainer videos about forest phenomena, from what makes a tree alive to mystery forest scat. He’s also in a ten-piece punk band, the Bubs. On Tuesday, Tapper read to legislators from a section of his first book, “How to Love a Forest,” that details a walk in the woods with a fellow forester, one who tends to the land as an “expression of care and compassion in a world of exploitation and short sightedness.” In the excerpt, Tapper describes the responsibility of managing a landscape as “building a better legacy for those who may someday follow, whoever they are.”For Tapper, that includes a proactive, hands-on approach to forest management: actions like cutting down trees, moving plants around, and even spraying some herbicide every now and then. Leaving a forest totally untouched, is not an act of compassion, he says.He foresees a new era of environmentalism in that vein on its way. “For a long time, a lot of these really powerful environmental movements have been basically just about stopping doing things,” Tapper said. “But this new era of environmentalism is about doing less of the bad stuff and also more of the good stuff, and being willing to actually step into our role as stewards of this planet.”In the knowState leaders and environmental organizations used Earth Day as an opportunity to defend Vermont’s climate change initiatives in light of a suite of recent actions made by President Donald Trump.Among other federal moves, an April 8 executive order from the Trump administration singles out Vermont for its efforts to hold energy producers financially responsible for contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. At a press conference at the Statehouse, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark doubled down on her commitment to fight the executive order, which is aimed at state climate laws that the president believes threaten “American energy dominance.”“We marked our calendar 60 days from April 8, because that’s when we expect that the (Department of Justice) is going to act in response to this executive order,” she said in an interview. “There’s probably a number of things they’re considering, and whatever it is, we will be ready.

Peter Welch, D-Vt., visited Mohsen Mahdawi in a Vermont jail Monday, sharing a snippet of their conversation to social media.And on Tuesday, more than 100 people rallied at the Statehouse to call for his release and what they characterized as the federal government’s circumvention of due process. Mahdawi, a Palestinian student organizer at Columbia University who lives in the Upper Valley, was arrested by federal agents in Colchester last week during an interview for U.S. citizenship. Masked federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle, and he was later detained at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans. Lawyers for Mahdawi quickly filed a lawsuit arguing his detention was unlawful, and a federal judge in Vermont ordered that he not be taken from the state. A hearing in his case is scheduled for Wednesday morning. Vermont House adopted a resolution Tuesday “objecting to the manner and circumstances” of Mahdawi’s detention and calling for him to be “released immediately.” Read more about the ongoing response to the detention here.— Ethan WeinsteinMinisters attend a press conference called to denounce last week’s detention of Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, April 22. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerOn the moveThousands of Vermonters could see their medical debt wiped away under a bill headed to the governor’s desk. The legislation, S. 27, would use $1 million in funds appropriated to the Treasurer’s Office to erase $100 million in Vermonters’ medical debt. It would also prohibit credit reporting agencies from taking into account Vermonters’ medical debt when determining their credit scores. “With medical debt, it often happens to you when you have no control,” Vermont Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who has spearheaded the proposal, told lawmakers this month. “You don’t have the ability to say, ‘I’m going to delay this care or delay this treatment.’ You don’t have the ability to shop around. You’re being taken by ambulance to a hospital and the procedure’s happening to you.”The bill leverages the fact that medical debt can be purchased for pennies on the dollar — roughly one penny per dollar of debt, in fact. Thus, a $1 million investment could erase about $100 million of debt. The legislation has received unanimous support from both chambers of Vermont’s General Assembly. The bill passed the Senate last month, and House lawmakers voted it out Tuesday. The bill, now poised to become law, would place Vermont among roughly 20 states and cities that have used public funds to eliminate residents’ medical debts. Read more about the legislation here.— Peter D’AuriaVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Local forester, TikTok-celeb and punk rocker opens Earth Day session at the Vermont House.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ethan-tapper-1-20250422.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

State laws are not a threat to American energy,” she said. Senate President Pro Tem Phil Baruth emphasized on Tuesday that Trump’s policies have created uncertainty within Vermont’s energy, housing and climate resiliency initiatives. “We passed the Climate Superfund, the flood safety, pollinator protection bill, S.25, banning toxic forever chemicals … all of those things were groundbreaking, as is the renewable energy standard and the Global Warming Solutions Act,” Baruth said. “All of those things are under attack. Every single one of them.”READ MORE
He said that while climate protection laws have historically faced opposition from state Republicans, some may attempt to distance themselves from the Trump administration’s “wholesale attack on the environment.”While some state Republicans initially opposed many climate solution bills, Baruth said there has not been much demonstrated follow up, which he takes to mean “that the stronger minority has looked at those laws and the support for them, and in some cases, decided to pull back.”Baruth, Clark, Hierl and all of the speakers present at the meeting stated their confidence in the ability of Vermont lawmakers. Baruth said that over the past decade, Vermont has passed numerous laws to ensure a healthy environment and to uphold the mantra “protect and defend.”20 million Americans — at the time, 10% of the population of the United States — gathered at the first Earth Day event in 1970. Despite Earth Day’s previous bipartisan support, the current U.S. leadership seeks to reverse the progress of past administrations, Hierl said, by allowing corporations to “maximize their profits at the expense of our health and our communities.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  State leaders defend climate change initiatives despite Trump administration’s threats.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0950-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

The Public Utilities Commission voted 2-1 to deny the company’s application, but Summit immediately pledged to reapply with a “reduced scope.”
It was the second South Dakota denial for Summit, which has been seeking a permit to build a portion of its proposed $9 billion pipeline through South Dakota since 2022. The commission denied the company’s first application in 2023, after which the company modified its route and reapplied.

Pipeline news in Iowa
Why hasn’t a pipeline bill come to Senate floor? Lawmakers blame opposing parties

The pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where a Summit official has acknowledged some carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. The project seeks to capitalize on a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Its path forward was complicated by the South Dakota Legislature’s passage of a carbon pipeline eminent domain ban, which was signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
A spokeswoman with the company vowed Tuesday in a prepared statement to refile an application for the project that “reflects a reduced scope and continued engagement with landowners and plant partners.”
The move further delays the pipeline in Iowa, where regulators have granted a permit to Summit Carbon Solutions but stipulated that the company needs permits in the Dakotas before construction can begin.
Opposing landowners celebrate
Too many landowners at key points along the proposed route vowed to never sign an easement agreement for the project, rendering the application incomplete and ill-prepared for the permitting process to continue, said Commissioner Kristie Fiegen during the meeting.
“Summit’s route is uncertain at this point,” Fiegen said. “We really don’t know the route. We don’t know the timeframes. We don’t know their plan.”
PUC staff said the permit could be denied because “substantive changes” will be needed to the application if the company can’t move forward with the route it has on file. Denying the application would then be “the cleanest path forward,” according to the staff’s filed recommendation.
Attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project, said the application is impossible because “there’s nothing they can do to change these folks’ minds.” Seventy-nine South Dakota landowners declared they would never sign an easement, according to one of the commissioners.

“Is there another route?” Jorde said. “Yes, but not in this application.”
Property owners opposed to the pipeline applauded the commission’s decision. Ed Fischbach, a vocal critic of the project, said in a news release that the decision acknowledges “the company has run out of road to build” and frees landowners “to get on with their lives and businesses.”
But Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, who carried the successful eminent domain ban during the legislative session, said she has “a hard time believing” the project is over, especially if federal tax credits remain available.
The decision affirms that South Dakota is “open for business, but not for sale,” she said.
“If you have a great project and want to get it done in South Dakota, you should come in and do it the South Dakota way and people should be able to say yes or no to your project,” Lems said.
Summit officials ‘remain committed’ to state
The Public Utilities Commission instructed Summit earlier this month to present a plan to illustrate how the company can move forward – or not – under the new state law barring its use of eminent domain. At its previous meeting, the commission denied Summit’s request for a pause in permit proceedings.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project. A bill to ban eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines is being considered in the Iowa Statehouse.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke opposed South Dakota regulators’ decision Tuesday, calling it “a prejudice” to the company pushed by opponents.
“You should ask yourselves why they’re fighting so hard to have this application denied and sent back,” Koenecke told commissioners. “I’d submit to you that the answer is likely they know it’s harder to restart.”
Commissioner Chris Nelson dissented from his colleagues Fiegen and Gary Hanson, arguing that Summit’s declaration that “they’re not going to challenge” the eminent domain ban, in addition to minor changes to the pipeline’s planned route, are enough for the project to move forward.
Summit filed paperwork with the commission this month stating that it would rather work with its current application and route than seek court orders or refer the ban to the voters, adding that “threatening legal action is counter-productive to attempting to do business in good faith in the state.”
In a prepared statement, the Summit spokeswoman said company officials are “disappointed” in the commission’s decision but “remain committed” to South Dakota and the project.
“Without it the ethanol industry, farmers and land values in the state will all suffer,” she said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Members of the federal government’s ocean-mapping corps and Alaskans training for the merchant marine would continue to receive Permanent Fund dividends while away from the state, under a bill approved last week by the Alaska House of Representatives.
House Bill 75, from Rep. Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan, is the first piece of legislation from a freshman lawmaker to pass either the House or Senate this year.
If approved by the Senate and signed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, it would create new exceptions to the requirement that Alaskans be within the state in order to receive the dividend.
HB 75 would keep college students’ spring breaks and fall breaks from counting against their allowable absences from the state, and members of the “uniformed services,” rather than just the U.S. military, would receive exceptions as well.
That changed definition would allow members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, which operates the federal government’s fleet of mapping ships and conducts other scientific missions, to continue receiving dividends even if deployed away from the state.
HB 75 also allows the Permanent Fund Dividend Division to fingerprint its employees for federal criminal background checks and allows the general public to opt out of paper mailers for notices.
The House passed the bill 35-5, with five members of the Republican House minority opposed. None explained their reason during an eight-minute-long bill debate. It advances to the Senate for consideration.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) FARGO, N.D. – Matt Perdue, government relations director for the North Dakota Farmers Union, on Tuesday told U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that staff cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture have farmers worried they won’t get the help they need in securing federal loans. 
“Earlier this year, we had a farm loans webinar. That same webinar last year had 17 attendees. This year it had 107 and I think that is an indication of the financial stress and uncertainty out there,” Perdue said. “I think it also is an indication of how important FSA (Farm Service Agency) farm loans are for producers when times get tough.”

Rollins, who held a roundtable discussion with farm groups in Fargo on Tuesday, said she understands the concerns as USDA shrinks its workforce but she tried to offer some reassurances. 
She said USDA workers were told last week, “If you are FSA or frontline or with the farmers, you are not eligible to take early retirement.” 
Rollins, invited by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., listened to the discussion from ag groups, state officials and North Dakota State University representatives at a gathering on the NDSU campus. She said it was her first visit to a land grant university.
Rollins announced during the event that USDA was releasing $340 million in disaster assistance for farmers and rural communities impacted by natural disasters. 
The aid includes $5 million for North Dakota rural electric co-ops affected by wildfires during drought conditions last fall. 
President Joe Biden had approved a major disaster declaration for North Dakota in December. 
Rollins also repeated an announcement from last week of a new sugar tariff. She said that through Sept. 30, products with more than 65% sugar content will face an additional tariff of 33%. 
“President Trump loves to deploy tariffs,” Rollins said.

Rollins planned to visit a processing plant for sugar beets, a key specialty crop in the Red River Valley. 
Tariffs, trade and how specialty crops might be treated in farm bill were among the topics covered. Specialty crops such as potatoes, dry beans and sunflowers are a big part of agriculture in North Dakota. 
Congress has not been able to reach an agreement on a new farm bill, last year extending the previous version. 
Gary Shields, executive director of the Northland Potato Growers Association, relayed a message from the National Potato Council about the possibility of specialty crops being left out of the next stopgap farm legislation.
“The big message is that specialty crop funding needs to be included,” Shields said. 
On trade, North Dakota Agriculture Secretary Doug Goehring said the last four years have been disappointing for ag trade and the United States should “reengage with the world.”
Rollins said she could not believe how “stunningly bad” the United States was treated on the world stage. 
Participants also emphasized the importance of decreasing regulation on farmers. 
Ryan Ellis, a farmer and president of the North Dakota Grain Growers, described the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement of the Endangered Species Act to be “terrifying.” 
Rollins was scheduled to get a closeup look at ag research at Grand Farm, a public-private collaboration west of Fargo near Casselton.

Jim Pillen-pushed proposal to merge two Nebraska state agencies into a unified department in charge of water resources has moved on to its final lawmaking stage.
On Tuesday, Nebraska lawmakers advanced Legislative Bill 317 on a voice vote. It calls for combining the Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment and Energy into the new Department of Water, Energy and Environment.
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth.  (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
Introduced by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, LB 317 would rename the current DEE director as the new DWEE director. The current DNR director would be renamed “Chief Water Officer” under the new department.
Pillen earlier this year named the merger as one of his legislative priorities, saying his changes would help the state be more proactive instead of reactive with water policy. 
Upon clearing the second round of debate, Pillen on Tuesday praised LB 317 as a “commonsense” piece of legislation that “reduces the scope of state government operations.”
 A ‘rebranding’ 

The bill was selected as a priority bill of the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee, though it has not been smooth sailing. Some people testifying at a February committee hearing argued the merger could divide rather than increase attention on water. 
Tuesday, questions continued.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said she was not inherently opposed but did not have enough information to determine if the idea was good or not. She said the merger was billed as a means to be more efficient but that she did not see efficiencies spelled out.
“So it’s a little difficult to say, ‘Oh yeah, this makes sense,’” Cavanaugh said.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln said it would be more accurate to call the bill a “rebranding.” She said the bill lacked a clear account of cost savings.
Pillen plan to merge two agencies hits rough waters at legislative hearing

Said State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha: “Why are we doing this if it doesn’t save money?”
State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, a supporter, said she was optimistic that cost savings would come as administrative roles are clarified.
An updated financial impact statement attached to the bill said that costs — including a new website, letterhead and placards — could be absorbed into the current budget (an earlier estimate projected a $200,000 cost).
Currently for fiscal year 2024-25, state and federal appropriations for the two departments total about $203 million, according to the impact statement. It said that over time, efficiencies of a merger are expected to result in a savings. 
 Amendments

The bill advanced with two amendments, LB 1124 by Conrad and FA 116 by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. Brandt described them as neutral or friendly. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha used the debate to push lawmakers to reconsider the size of the proposed Perkins County Canal in western Nebraska through two amendments, to the cost savings of $61 million on the first and $150 million on the other.
Both amendments were defeated.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would repeal state law governing the day labor industry in Florida was approved in a House committee on Tuesday and now will move to the full chamber for consideration.
The proposal (HB 6033), sponsored by North Florida Republican Rep. Shane Abbott, is necessary, he says, because Florida’s Labor Pool Act, passed in 1995, is duplicative of federal labor law.
A Senate staff analysis says the state law “provides for the health, safety and well-being of day laborers throughout the state and outlines uniform standards of conduct and practice for labor pools.”
Abbott has said that Florida day labor employees (including those working in construction, hospitality, janitorial, and agriculture) are protected because Florida has its own version of OSHA, the federal Occupational Safety Health Administration.
There is one problem with that, Rich Templin of the Florida AFL-CIO told the House Commerce Committee.
“There is no state OSHA,” he said, referencing to the situation in 2021 when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called upon the Legislature to set up a state-run agency to supersede the federal OSHA because of COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the Joe Biden administration.
The Legislature passed such a bill, and DeSantis signed it in November 2021, but as WTSP reported at the time, the whole process of creating a plan “could take anywhere from two to five years,” and the law does not appear to have ever been implemented.
“A vote for this bill is literally taking away rights and protections of over a million workers in the state of Florida, including people in your district,” Templin said Tuesday. “When these labor pools realize that they’re not governed by state law anymore, bad things are gong to happen. And those workers are going to wonder how did this happen, and they’re going to look to you.”
Violations
One of the groups registered to lobby in support of the legislation is Pacesetter Personnel Services,which was the subject of a federal class action alleging labor violations in Florida, including failing to provide water and bathrooms on the job, overcharging for transportation, and failure to pay for time spent waiting for assignments. A federal judge in the fall of 2023 dismissed the plaintiffs’ complaints but said they could refile later..
“They’ve been sued for denying workers access to water, bathrooms, and fair pay, and now they want use to legalize that abuse,” said Jackson Oberlink of the progressive group Florida For All. “If you vote yes on this bill, you are siding with them, and I don’t think that’s who you want to be.”
“These workers already face low wages, unsafe conditions, and a high risk of wage theft,” added Jonathan Webber of the Southern Poverty Law Center. “The Labor Pool Act fills key gaps where federal law is silent or inefficient.”
Miami-Dade County Democratic Rep. Kevin Chambliss said that he has encouraged young men he knows who need work to participate in day labor pools. “If you’re there at 5:00 in the morning, if you’re there all week, I promise you at some point you’re going to be able to go out for work and at some point hopefully you’ll be able to be picked up by a company.”
Whether the bill will pass into law this year is in question, however, after the Senate bill (SB 1672) was temporarily postponed in the Senate Fiscal Policy Committee on Tuesday. There are no longer any committee meetings scheduled before the 60-day session is slated to end on May 2.

The legislation is a response to a flurry of lawsuits brought against Louisiana nursing homes, whose owners are prolific donors to legislators and other state elected officials, over the last two years. 
Just one California-based law firm, Garcia & Artigliere, has 66 lawsuits pending against nursing homes across the state. They would be curbed if the legislation becomes law, said Matthew Coman, the firm’s attorney in New Orleans who handles its local cases. 
In addition to sponsoring the bill, Seabaugh was hired as an attorney to defend a Bossier Parish nursing home operator against a Garcia & Artigliere lawsuit the legislation could restrict.  
“The fact is, unlike trial lawyers, I actually try to pass bills that cost me business,” Seabaugh said when asked to comment on his involvement in one of the lawsuits. 
“If the bill passes, people in the future don’t hire me,”  he said. “I’m perfectly happy to pass bills that cost me business.”

Advocates for senior citizens are opposed to the legislation, saying it will prevent improvements to Louisiana’s already poorly-rated nursing home industry. 
“What this means is, if your loved one is in a nursing home and is injured due to abuse or neglect, you and your family might be paying for their injuries instead of being able to properly seek legal restitution,” said Andrew Muhl, state advocacy director for AARP Louisiana. 
The Louisiana Nursing Home Association, a trade group that represents nursing home owners, did not respond to multiple calls and emails with questions for this report. 
Medical malpractice
Pressly, the co-author of the bill, said the state needs to rein in health care lawsuits that are circumventing the state’s existing medical malpractice restrictions. 

In Louisiana, most lawsuits brought against a health care provider for injury or death have an award cap of $500,000 outside of costs related to future medical care. Of the $500,000, only $100,000 has to come directly from the health care provider. The remaining $400,000 comes from a state fund set up to cover those expenses. 

Coman and his law firm get around this medical malpractice cap and have won multimillion dollar verdicts for their clients by suing nursing homes management companies alongiside the nursing homes themselves. 

Coman contends the management companies are not direct health care providers and therefore not covered by the medical malpractice cap. The Pressly and Seabaugh legislation would make it explicit in the law that management organizations are health care providers covered by malpractice limits. 
“I think it’s important that we shore up the medical malpractice act,” Pressly said. 
Bob Dean Protection Act
A similar bill was derailed in the legislature last year after it became known as the “Bob Dean Protection Act,” a reference to the disgraced nursing home owner who moved approximately 840 residents from his nursing homes to an ill-equipped, former pesticide warehouse for shelter during Hurricane Ida in 2021. 

Dean’s shelter in Tangipahoa Parish was without air conditioning and unsanitary. Residents were not provided with adequate food, toilets, bedding and showers, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, which performed an emergency evacuation from the warehouse. 
Some of the residents’ deaths and declines in health have been attributed to the site’s atrocious conditions. About half of the residents sent to the warehouse joined a class-action lawsuit to obtain financial damages from Dean. 

Coman, who worked on the lawsuit from Dean’s residents, maintains this year’s legislation, like last year’s version, would make such court actions impossible. Dean’s residents and their surviving family members, who are already upset about the sizes of their awards, would have seen far less compensation, he said. 
“It would eviscerate a cause of action and an ability to sue for a claim of damages across the board,” Coman said of the Pressly and Seabaugh bill. 

Pressly disagrees. The limits his legislation would place on nursing home lawsuits would not have applied in the Dean case because Dean’s behavior was so egregious, it is considered “intentional” and “criminal,”  he said. 
Bed sore lawsuits

Since last year’s legislation was scuttled, Coman’s clients have won two verdicts from Louisiana juries against nursing homes. 

One awarded $3.5 million to the surviving relatives of nursing home patients who died after living at Chateau St. James Rehab and Retirement in Lutcher. A separate $2.1 million award was given to Bonnie Bennett, whose father, Raymond Davidson, died after living at Heritage Manor West in Shreveport. 
Bennett’s lawsuit and the one that Seabaugh is defending against a nursing home are similar. 

Bennett alleged her father developed bed sores on lower back, buttocks and groin because his Shreveport nursing home did not have enough nurses on staff at the facility. Those conditions allegedly led to his death, according to her lawsuit. 

Seabaugh is one of a handful of lawyers defending the Old Brownlee Community Care Center in Bossier City against another lawsuit from Kimberly Remedies.  

Remedies’ father, Frank Hooper, was transferred to a hospital after a two-week stay at the nursing home. She alleges he developed bed sores and “severe sepsis”  during his time at the home, which contributed to his death a few months later, according to her lawsuit. The care center has denied the accusations. 
Seabaugh has said there is a risk of several nursing homes in Louisiana closing if the state doesn’t try to limit damages from such lawsuits. The facilities don’t have adequate insurance to fight these types of legal actions, he said. 

“It will bankrupt every nursing home in the state,” Seabaugh said. 

Strong political connections 

Nursing home owners are largely dependent on public the state Medicaid program, which is overseen by the Louisiana Department of Health. As a result, the owners are very active in politics and among the most generous political donors to legislators and governors alike. 

A WVUE-TV Fox 8 investigation found the nursing home industry spent $3.2 million on political contributions to  state elected officials over four years from 2017-20. Facility owners are also paying lobbyists who work during the legislative session more than $375,000 this year, according to state records. 
The Bossier City nursing home Seabaugh is defending is also part of CommCare Corp., a statewide nursing home network former Louisiana House Speaker Jim Tucker leads.

Coman’s law firm is pushing back, however. State records show Garcia & Artigliere donated $25,000 to Cajun PAC II, a political committee benefitting Gov. Jeff Landry. The contribution came on June 25, 2024, less than a month after the legislature adjourned its regular session last year without passing the nursing home protection legislation. 

The California law firm also hired four Louisiana-based lobbyists ahead of the legislative session this year. They include Alton Ashy, who is close to the governor, for at least $100,000, and former state Sen. Rick Ward for at least $25,000, according to state records.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nursing-home-1024x577.png,,,2025-04-22 19:07:21.395925

The legislation, spearheaded by Treasurer Mike Pieciak, would erase an estimated $100 million of Vermonters’ medical debt.

Woodman Page, R-Newport City, explains details of a medical debt relief bill on the floor of the House the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, April 18. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThousands of Vermonters could see their medical debt wiped away under a bill headed to the governor’s desk. The legislation, S. 27, would use $1 million in funds appropriated to the Treasurer’s Office to erase $100 million in Vermonters’ medical debt. It would also prohibit credit reporting agencies from taking into account Vermonters’ medical debt when determining their credit scores. “With medical debt, it often happens to you when you have no control,” Vermont Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who has spearheaded the proposal, told lawmakers this month. “You don’t have the ability to say, ‘I’m going to delay this care or delay this treatment.’ You don’t have the ability to shop around. You’re being taken by ambulance to a hospital and the procedure’s happening to you.”The bill leverages the fact that medical debt can be purchased for pennies on the dollar — roughly one penny per dollar of debt, in fact. Thus, a $1 million investment could erase about $100 million of debt. Pieciak estimated that the legislation could eliminate medical debt for about 60,000 Vermonters. The $1 million investment would come out of $20 million in general funds appropriated to the Treasurer’s Office to pay off bonds before their maturation date. According to the Joint Fiscal Office, if that $1 million was used for its initial purpose, the state could have saved about $50,000 in interest. Rep. Anne Donahue, I-Northfield, speaks about her personal experiences with mental health during discussion of a medical debt relief bill on the floor of the House at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, April 18. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe legislation has received unanimous support from both chambers of Vermont’s General Assembly. The bill passed the Senate last month, and House lawmakers voted it out Tuesday. The bill, now poised to become law, would place Vermont among roughly 20 states and cities that have used public funds to eliminate residents’ medical debts. To wipe away Vermonters’ health care debts, the bill directs the state to partner with a nonprofit, Undue Medical Debt, which would work with health care providers to purchase the debt. It’s not clear whether all hospitals or health care providers would sign up to participate. But Devon Green, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, said earlier this year that her organization supports the bill “wholeheartedly.”Vermont’s program would prioritize people whose debts are older than 18 months old. The debts must be considered uncollectible by health care providers, and the individuals must fulfill one of the following criteria: Either their debt must be 5% of a household’s annual income, or the individuals or households have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level — currently, $60,240 for a single person or $124,800 for a family of four. Residents would not need to apply to have their debt canceled and would be enrolled automatically and notified if their debt is erased.Mike Fisher, Vermont’s chief health care advocate, told lawmakers this month that the bill was an important step forward in helping Vermonters find relief from health care debt. “We think whenever anybody brings concerns about medical debt and advances the conversation about medical debt in the public, that’s a good thing,” Fisher said. “So we appreciate the Treasurer’s Office for bringing this forward.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Legislature passes bill to erase medical debt.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/woodman-page-1-20250418.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.


In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

Martinez was one of 42 people who applied for the job to lead the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education since the search began in December.
The post Outgoing Chicago schools head tapped for top Mass. job appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PEDRO MARTINEZ, the superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, is on track to become Massachusetts’s next education commissioner after a 9-0-2 vote of the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education on Tuesday.Praising Martinez’s work closing achievement gaps for students in poverty, multilingual learners and students of color, as well as his history of “standing up for kids” in politically challenging environments, board members who backed Martinez described him as the right person for this moment when the state is at odds with the federal government and the Bay State’s standing as an educational leader is shaky.“There’s a proven track record of success in extraordinarily unideal contexts,” Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler said.Two board members — Dálida Rocha and Mary Ann Stewart — abstained from the vote, having said earlier in Tuesday’s meeting that they planned to cast their votes for Lily Laux, executive director of Economic Mobility Systems and former deputy commissioner of school programs at the Texas Education Agency.Martinez was one of 42 people who applied for the job to lead the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) since the search began in December, and he was one of three finalists. The other two were Laux and Jack Elsey, founder of the Michigan Educator Workforce Initiative.The state has been without a permanent commissioner since its former leader, Jeff Riley, stepped down in March 2024. The K-12 department was run intermittently by longtime DESE deputy Russell Johnston, who stepped down at the end of last month to take a superintendent job in Pennsylvania. BESE hopes to have its new commissioner in place by July.Martinez has led the Chicago Public Schools, the fourth-largest district in the country, since 2021. In December, the CPS school board voted to fire him without cause after a public dispute with the Chicago Teacher’s Union and Mayor Brandon Johnson. Martinez is set to leave the district as superintendent in June.According to local reporting, Johnson and Martinez clashed over how to pay for a new teachers contract. Martinez refused the mayor’s request to take out a $300 million short-term high-interest loan, saying it could downgrade the district’s bond rating status and saddle it with costs that would divert future funds to be able to hire more teachers and counselors.During his interview before the Massachusetts board last week, Martinez said he was proud of his track record of pandemic recovery in the Chicago schools, which he said were in “disarray” when he arrived.“The children were just barely coming back into classes. There had been walkouts by the union and staff every year for three years in a row. There was no trust with our parents. There was no trust with our school leaders,” he said. “So the first year, I was able to stabilize the district and just build trust … By the end of the second year, we were leading the nation in recovery for literacy, led by our Black students and second by our Latino students. Our high schools hit record levels across graduation rates, credits earned, and that continued until my third year. And this is a district that leads the country — 70% of our graduates go to college, 73% persist.”Martinez himself is a graduate of Chicago Public Schools, having immigrated to the area at 5 years old from Mexico. He is the oldest of 12 children, and told the board about his childhood growing up in poverty, as his father worked two jobs and his parents never advanced beyond an elementary school education.Throughout all his answers during the public interview last week, a persistent theme was on closing achievement gaps between students in poverty and well-resourced schools — something that Board Chair Katherine Craven said “we have been stalling out on in Massachusetts for several years,” in explaining why she was voting for Martinez.Martinez said he would “always be a proponent for all students” but that “systems are designed” for well-resourced, higher-income students, but not for students in poverty, English learners or students with disabilities.“I think the most strong attributes of both his career and his comments were Superintendent Martinez’s focus on children in poverty, his bedrock belief that poor children can learn, and that low expectations are what need to be driven out of the educator space as firmly as possible,” board member Michael Moriarty of Holyoke said.DESE is struggling to reorient itself after its long-term accountability system was dismantled by voters last fall, and high school students no longer have to pass the MCAS exam in order to graduate. Members of the board have approached the topic of redesigning district accountability with apprehension, but Martinez called it a “huge opportunity.”“You talk about this vision of students being biliterate and bilingual, graduating with certifications and being able to go into high wage, livable jobs. Kids going to college with college credit, kids having the capacity to get into highly selective colleges, or our special needs students, getting them into work programs because their parents want them to be independent. But yet, the accountability system at the federal level is not aligned to that. It’s not aligned to that at the state level as well,” Martinez said. He added, “When the North Star is confusing, it creates challenges.”Before working in Chicago, he also served as the superintendent of the San Antonio Independent School District and superintendent of the Washoe County School District in Nevada.When he was in San Antonio, Martinez publicly clashed with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott over COVID-19 safety protocols. He said before the pandemic hit, the largely low-income district was considered the fastest improving district in the state.“I was doing well in San Antonio — pandemic hit, but we were ready for it,” he said. “I had to stand up with some fights that, this time, it was with the governor, with the district attorney, who didn’t believe in our children masking, and didn’t want to prioritize our teachers for vaccinations. And I fought that hard.”San Antonio schools returned to in-person learning after they were shut down in the spring of 2020, with the fight over which safety protocols to use in the classrooms.“That was a very public fight. You can look it up. But again, I got through that,” Martinez said.Martinez was fired from his job as superintendent in Washoe County in 2014 after two years on the job, according to the Reno Gazette Journal. The Gazette Journal said the school board then backtracked, saying it was only an administrative leave, and Martinez filed a wrongful termination suit.Of the experience, he said during his interview, “The new board came in, wanted to redirect funds that we were really putting aside that were getting great success and increasing graduation rates. Got into a big dispute with them. I stood our ground. I had complete support of the governor and staff at that point, but, unfortunately, wound up having to separate from there.”A number of board members praised Martinez as someone who stands up for students and “seems to be coming out ahead” every time he faces controversy. They said having someone who can handle tough situations will be important in this political moment.Massachusetts receives over $2 billion in federal education funding per year, a number that the state cannot fully replace, and officials are bracing for possible cuts from the Trump administration.Additionally, state education officials say they’re worried the Bay State’s continued focus on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives could draw President Donald Trump’s attention and ire.“Given our current educational climate, both within the state and with the federal government, we need someone who can stay standing and continue fighting the good fight and continue our path forward in the commonwealth,” board member Ericka Fisher said.The post Outgoing Chicago schools head tapped for top Mass. job appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pedro-Martinez-DESE.png?fit=1024%2C707&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Photo courtesy of Drake University)An organization involved in litigation with universities across the U.S. has filed a federal complaint against Drake University in Des Moines, alleging one of its scholarship programs violates federal anti-discrimination law.
The Equal Protection Project, a branch of the Legal Insurrection Foundation, submitted a civil rights complaint Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights against the private university. The organization, which  says it is “devoted to the fair treatment of all persons without regard to race or ethnicity,” claims in the complaint Drake is violating Title IV by limiting eligibility of one of its scholarship programs, the Crew Scholars Program, to students of color.
“Drake is expanding DEI activities at a time when the State of Iowa and the federal government are scaling back,” said William Jacobson, founder of the Equal Protection Project, in an emailed statement. “Regardless of where one stands on the DEI debate, discrimination based on race violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Iowa state law, and Drake’s own non-discrimination rules. Drake should open up the scholarship to all students without regard to race.”

Drake University spokesperson Ashton Hockman said in an email the university cannot comment at this time, as it has not received any communication from the U.S. Department of Education.
The Crew Scholars Program is described online as an “academic excellence and leadership development program for incoming students with a passion for diversity” that provides $500 annual scholarships to participating students.
According to the civil rights complaint, the scholarship program limits participation to students of color. The complaint cites as evidence a university website link and screenshots showing the program description including the language “The Crew Scholars Program at Drake University is open to incoming domestic students of color in any major.”
A different website describing the scholars program eliminates references to race in who is allowed to apply.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act forbids “intentional discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin” in any program that receives federal support, the complaint stated, and as Drake University receives federal funding, it is in violation of the law. Referencing the U.S. Department of Education’s Feb. 14 “Dear Colleague” letter, the complaint stated that regardless of its reasons for offering a “discriminatory program,” Drake is still violating the law.
“Accordingly, we respectfully ask that the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights promptly open a formal investigation, impose such remedial relief as the law permits for the benefit of those who have been illegally excluded from Drake’s various programs based on discriminatory criteria, and ensure that all ongoing and future programming at Drake comports with the federal civil rights laws,” the complaint stated.
Drake has reiterated its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion multiple times as state and federal actions have required universities to pull back on such programming, including implementing new programming to ensure all students feel like they belong and speaking out against decisions that negatively impact campus and Drake students.
Drake President Marty Martin published a letter in early March telling students they are all welcome at the university despite contrary messages such as legislation to repeal the inclusion of transgender and nonbinary people in civil rights protections. Martin called the law “one among many current state and federal efforts that seek to turn our differences into division.”
“This is a moral failure against which we stand in opposition,” Martin said in the letter. “It is our duty to respect, support, and affirm anyone in our community targeted by these actions.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Mary-Murphy Walsh shouted into a megaphone across Blackstone Boulevard, her voice gradually rising to a roar as a chorus echoed back in her direction.
“Out here on the picket line/Butler must have lost its mind,” Walsh and Butler Hospital workers sang as they marched in single file on opposite sides of the boulevard in Providence’s East Side.  
Walsh, a labor organizer with SEIU-1199, led about 200 unionized employees of Butler Hospital in an informational picket Monday, with workers arriving and departing in waves as they finished or started their shifts at Rhode Island’s only private, nonprofit psychiatric and substance abuse hospital. 
On a walking path situated in between the boulevard’s opposite lanes, passersbys including dog walkers, a pack of Brown University runners, and other amblers turned their heads toward the picket’s noise. The busy road’s passing cars honked often. A kid on his bike stopped to watch and tap along with the drumbeat played by picketers.
Contrasting the workers’ almost celebratory sense of solidarity were their sobering complaints. According to the union, incidents of violence against staff have risen 41% since 2022. A union survey suggests that 95% of Butler caregivers think Care New England, the hospital’s parent company, “is not doing enough to keep them safe at work.”
Catherine Maynard, a registered nurse in the hospital’s geriatric unit, said in a statement ahead of the picket that a 2023 injury acquired while restraining a patient herniated discs in her back. 
“Two years later, I still work with pain and, at 29, I may be dealing with back problems for the rest of my life,” Maynard wrote.
SEIU 1119 has four contracts with Butler which cover professional and clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff. All four contracts expired on March 31.
Workplace violence, union members say, is exacerbated by staffing shortages and low wages. Butler employs a little over 1,000 people annually, according to reports filed with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2023. Right now, the hospital has about 116 open positions. 
Workers are also dissatisfied with their wages. Under the recently expired contract, mental health workers started at $18.27 an hour. Housekeeping and dietary staff started at $16.08, clerical workers started at $19.76, and professional staff and registered nurses started at $32.50.

6.2% wage hikes offered
Starting wages could increase about 6.2% under Butler’s recent proposals depending on employee classification. A mental health worker’s initial wage could rise to $19.40 by 2028, under a proposal illustrated in hospital documents released April 2. Existing mental health workers could see incremental increases over the course of the four-year contract, from around 13% to 16%, for a total of about $23 or $24 hourly. 
Under Butler’s April 2 proposal, starting wages would rise as follows by April 1, 2028:

Housekeeping and dietary staff would start at $17.06 an hour.  
Clerical workers would start at $20.97 an hour.
Professional staff and registered nurses would start at $34.49 an hour.

The proposed starting wages, according to the hospital, “represent the highest opening wage increase offer from Butler in over 10 years of negotiations.”
Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and chief operating officer, said the six-hour picket occurred despite the hospital’s “ongoing commitment to open and constructive negotiations,” in a statement Monday.
“From the start, Butler’s leadership has been fully engaged in the bargaining process,” Marran said. “We recognize the importance of wages, benefits, and workplace safety, and we have worked diligently and in good faith to address these issues. Our goal remains a fair and equitable agreement that supports our employees while upholding the exceptional care our patients deserve.”
Part of the hospital’s initiative to be transparent in negotiating included a website, ButlerInfoForYou.org, expressly designed to share information on the negotiation process. The domain was registered on Jan. 30, shortly before contract negotiations were to begin. It includes the hospital’s proposed terms and revisions for each of the four contracts. According to a site calendar which lists meeting dates, the most bargaining talks were on April 15.










Our goal remains a fair and equitable agreement that supports our employees while upholding the exceptional care our patients deserve.


– Mary E. Marran, Butler Hospital president and chief operating officer


The website also includes a question and answer section in which the hospital responded to questions, such as “Why can’t Butler Hospital retain staff to work the inpatient units?” and “Why is it that when a nurse manager gets assaulted, the cops are called and patient gets arrested but when an mhw [mental health worker] is assaulted, no one bats an eye?”
Ian Lacombe, a registered nurse in Butler’s emergency department who has been with the hospital for over two decades, described the union’s next steps in an emailed statement Tuesday. 
“Our goal is to reach a fair contract agreement and we look forward to returning to the bargaining table on April 29,” Lacombe said. “But we refuse to settle if we are unable to make concrete gains that significantly improve staffing and safety concerns that continue to put us in harm’s way. Our patients come to Butler in need of mental health and substance abuse support but we can’t adequately meet their needs due to short staffing. We do not want to strike but are prepared to take that step to protect our patients from the current environment.”

Punched, pushed, kicked and headbutted
Problems with inpatient violence are not new at Butler or psychiatric institutions elsewhere. An OSHA filing recounts a Jan. 29, 2021, incident in which a patient flipped a table, “began wielding colored pencils as weapons,” and spit bloody phlegm in one employee’s eyes.
During 2024, OSHA logs show that Butler workers were punched in the groin, struck in the chest, pushed against walls, and kicked in various body parts. Another employee received three headbutts to the nose. A patient flung a dinner plate at an intake coordinator. A staff nurse was grabbed from behind and choked by a patient. One patient tried to attack another, and when an employee intervened, the aggressor bit down on the worker’s tricep, destroying his diabetes monitoring device.   
Many recorded incidents occurred during attempts to restrain patients, but not all. The OSHA logs relay an incident from Feb. 24, 2024, when an “unprovoked” patient “repeatedly punched [an employee] in the face, nose, mouth and right eye.”
Marran wrote in her statement that “safety is non-negotiable” at Butler. 
“Like all Care New England hospitals, we have comprehensive protocols in place to protect staff and patients from workplace violence,” Marran stated. “Our nurses, clinical teams, and security personnel are trained in de-escalation techniques, and high-risk behavioral health areas receive enhanced support and staffing. We do not tolerate violence in any form. Our staff are committed professionals who work tirelessly under challenging circumstances, and we will continue to advocate for their safety and well-being.”
Patient violence toward staff, a common occupational hazard in psychiatric settings, intensified during the pandemic. A 2022 article in the journal AIMS Public Health noted that, during the pandemic’s heights in June 2020, psychiatric hospitals workers reported the highest rates of inpatient violence, with 57% of workers having experienced it. The authors’ analysis of previous research noted that the more beds were occupied in health care settings, the more likely it was that patient aggression would occur. 
“Although the clinician’s right to refuse treatment of violent patients is allowed by law, many practitioners still treat all patients who need our help, regardless of their actions or abusive potential,” the article noted in its conclusions. “Unfortunately, no matter what data are presented, medical and psychiatric facilities consistently stand out as some of the most dangerous workplaces in the United States.”
Documents shared by the union give even more specific details on incidents, including 111 assaults recorded thus far in 2025. These workplace incident reports include dialogue, actions taken by staff, and at times, hint at patients’ struggles, like on Jan. 27, when a patient packed her bags and headed for the door, yelling that she didn’t need to be at the hospital. Two staff members closed the door to prevent her escape, and the patient pushed them both. The workers were not injured.
According to the log, after the patient had been dosed with the strong tranquilizer thorazine and her parent notified of the incident, she came up to the worker she had pushed into a wall, and apologized.

With an unemployment rate of 2.7% in March, down from 2.8% last month, Montana has now seen six straight months of rates under 3%.
The governor’s office and Department of Labor and Industry continue to praise the low seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, the third stint below 3% since the Federal Reserve began measuring the rate in the 1970s.
Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, Montana saw an unemployment rate below 3% for two full years from October 2021 to October 2023.
It ticked up slightly from then to 3.1% in December of that year, before slowly ticking down. March marked the 45th consecutive month of unemployment at or below 3.4%.
“For six months, Montana’s unemployment rate has remained below 3%, with nearly two job openings for every unemployed worker,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a press release. “Through our efforts to lower taxes and remove red tape, we’ve have created an environment that empowers entrepreneurs and businesses to invest and create good-paying jobs for Montanans across our state.”
The unemployment was 1.5% lower than the national rate, which came in at 4.2% in March. The state’s unadjusted unemployment rate of 3.0% ranks 5th in the U.S. 
The state said the labor force in Montana decreased by 572 workers last month. Data shows the state has added 1,500 payroll jobs over the last month.
﻿﻿
Forty-four of the state’s counties currently have unemployment rates below 4%, and 19 of them have seen net job gains over the last year year, according to data from the Department of Labor and Industry.
Gallatin County has seen the largest drop in employment over the last year with 348 fewer people employed this year compared to last. Missoula county, however, has seen the most growth with 860 additional people becoming employed.
Unemployment rates remain higher on the state’s seven Native American reservations – ranging from a non-seasonally adjusted rate of 4.7% on the Flathead Indian Reservation up to 13.1% on Rocky Boy’s reservation. All seven reservations have seen net job decreases in the last year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HS1A0114-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 19:07:21.395925

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)Five international Rutgers University students and a recent graduate of the state school are suing the federal government for abruptly terminating their records in student visa status database, saying it has upended their lives and left in doubt whether they can remain in the United States. 
In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, the students say the effective termination of their F-1 student status bars them from working, stops them from continuing their studies and immediately makes them vulnerable to arrest, detention and deportation.
“I am afraid to leave my home out of fear that I will be detained. I feel that I am in a home prison,” one of the students said, according to Tuesday’s filing (it does not identify them by name).
At the center of the dispute is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, a federal database that colleges and universities use to track students’ compliance with their immigration status and share that information, like address and educational progress, with federal officials.
The 42-page complaint claims the federal government purged more than 1,000 SEVIS records since Jan. 20 — the day President Donald Trump took office for his second term — effectively putting an end to the student status and the benefits that come with it. The complaint names U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials as defendants.
The students are seeking a temporary restraining order that would prohibit the government from arresting, detaining or deporting them while the case is active. The risk these students face of detention is “currently very serious,” the attorneys wrote, pointing to others whose F-1 visas were revoked and were subsequently arrested by ICE. 
Jessica Rofé, director of the Constitutional Rights Clinic at Rutgers and an assistant law professor, is one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.
“The abrupt termination of their SEVIS records and status without meaningful process or justification in an attempt to coerce them to hastily depart upends their academic and career trajectories, disrupts our communities, and is an affront to due process,” Rofé said in a statement.
More than 23,000 international students attended New Jersey colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Institute of International Education. New Jersey ranks 17th in the country for accepting international students, who spent nearly $1 billion last year.
Getting a visa or protected status is a complicated process, with confusing forms to fill out and several requirements to fulfill to remain in good standing. An F-1 visa grants a student the status to remain in the United States as long as they’re studying or on a temporary work assignment, and are compliant with the law. Students can lose their status by failing classes or doing unauthorized work.
When ICE terminates a record in the system, that student is no longer protected. People can apply for reinstatement, but there is no way to appeal the SEVIS status change. 
Rutgers, Rowan, and Montclair State universities have seen roughly two dozen students notified of their visa status termination, according to NJ Spotlight News. Inside Higher Ed reported that more than 1,680 students nationwide have been notified of their SEVIS termination. 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that he began revoking the visas of students and visitors if “they’re taking activities that are counter to our foreign, to our national interest, to our foreign policy.” He said visa holders charged with a crime should automatically lose their status. It’s part of the Trump administration’s overarching plan to mass detain and deport undocumented residents and some people with legal status, particularly going after those connected to pro-Palestinian protests at universities. 
The attorneys representing the Rutgers plaintiffs  — the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey Foundation, the Rutgers Immigrant Community Assistance Project and Gibbons P.C. —noted they haven’t been charged with crimes or done anything to fall out of standing when ICE closed their records.
They charge that the misuse of SEVIS is key to the Trump administration’s plan to circumvent the law and “drive international students out of the country without due process and in violation of DHS regulations.” And if the government believes that students are deportable, the proceedings should take place in immigration court, the complaint states. 
The lawsuit describes a sweeping task force created within the Department of Homeland Security using data-mining tools to analyze the social media of 1.5 million students in attempts to deport them on charges that ordinarily would not be justified. It also alleges that students from China and India are being disproportionately targeted.
Without work authorization, the plaintiffs say they are unable to pay their expenses and face losing their homes. One student said they’d run out of money within two months, and another said they have a family abroad that relies on them for financial support.
Tuesday’s filing is the latest in a flood of lawsuits from students fighting the termination of their status. In New Hampshire, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to reverse the status of a Dartmouth student from China whose status was revoked.

Emilio M. Puente is suing the City of Iowa City in U.S. District Court for the Southern District or Iowa, claiming violations of the federal Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Puente worked for the city as a police officer from April 2019 through February 2022 and was awarded a number of commendations for bravery and high-quality performance, according to his lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that in November 2019, a fellow officer sent a department-wide email from Puente’s police email account that mocked Puente’s own Latino ethnicity in some way. The content of the email is not described in the lawsuit, but the lawsuit claims Puente’s superiors declined to investigate the matter.
When a similar incident occurred involving the unauthorized use of a Caucasian officer’s email account, the police chief sent out a memo indicating such behavior would not be tolerated, the lawsuit claims.
In July 2020, Puente and another officer pursued a fleeing suspect through a grassy area in their vehicles, according to the lawsuit. Puente alleges he was disciplined for driving through the grass while the other officer, a Caucasian, was not.
In November 2021, the lawsuit claims, Puente participated in the arrest of a suspect who was being “assaultive and resistant” which resulted in Puente delivering “two controlled strikes to the suspect.” Later, the suspect’s mother drew the department’s attention to a video, circulating on social media, of the arrest.
That led to an internal affairs investigation and Puente’s use of force was allegedly deemed reasonable by an instructor on the use of force and by an instructor on how to deescalate conflicts. Despite that, Puente alleges, he was told in February 2022 that the chief of police would be firing him and that “he would never again work in law enforcement unless he resigned.”
Puente claims he followed the advice of his union representatives and submitted a letter of resignation, but that at the time he made the decision, he was under the influence of pain medications for a leg injury.
“Because of his forced resignation,” the lawsuit asserts, Puente’s “disability pay was discontinued immediately and he was left without income.”
The lawsuit alleges that after a May 2022 Civil Service Commission hearing on his discipline, police department management made a statement to the press that Puente had committed misconduct by violating the city’s use-of-force policy, publicly impugning his character.
A month later, Puente claims, another video surfaced on social media showing one of Iowa City’s Caucasian officers striking a handcuffed female “more than seven times with his closed fist.” That officer, Puente argues, “was never disciplined” for the actions depicted in the video, nor did the department open an internal investigation.
That same Caucasian officer, the lawsuit claims, is depicted in yet another video that shows him beating an individual who posed no threat. Again, the lawsuit alleges, that officer was not subject to discipline or any sort of an investigation.
While Puente “was forced to resign and lost his disability income, the other officer was publicly defended by the ICPD,” the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for racial or ethnic discrimination and disability discrimination.
Puente’s attorney filed a similar claim against the city in July 2024. That lawsuit was challenged by the city, which noted that the suit was filed almost six months before Puente had obtained the necessary right-to-sue letter from the U.S. Department of Justice. Technically, that lawsuit remains open and active, although the new lawsuit states that it is “intended to cure any possible defect” in the 2024 filing.
Lawyers for the city have declined to comment on Puente’s allegations.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/police-sheriff-law-enforcement-squad-car-light-bar-getty-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 19:07:21.395925

The legislation makes drafting a bill without a lawmaker’s permission and advertising the legislation a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by one year in jail and a fine of up to $6,000.
The bill passed 94-1 with a floor amendment by Rep. Ben Robbins, R-Sylacauga, that clarified that the person publishing the bill was requested to do so by a legislator.
“I got recommendations from the county commission association to add this,” he said.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, was the only vote against the bill. He said he could not support it because of confusing language.
“I can’t support it the way it is written because you may catch somebody that’s trying to do the right thing and help you out,” England said.
The bill goes to the Senate.

Ron DeSantis' appointee to the University of West Florida Board of Trustees. (Photos via UWF website)Senators have made clear their hesitation to confirm some gubernatorial appointments this session, particularly for higher education institutions in Pensacola. 
Tuesday, the Ethics and Election Committee rejected one University of West Florida trustee, Adam Kissel, and questioned five others who appeared before the committee before being approved, while advancing another 120+ appointees for various boards across the state in one vote with no discussion or public appearances. 
Two other UWF trustees resigned from that board after intense public pushback. 
Also in Pensacola, former state Rep. Joel Rudman resigned Tuesday morning from his governor-appointed spot on the Pensacola State College board of trustees. 
Sen. Don Gaetz, chair of the committee, invited Rudman to appear Tuesday but was informed by Rudman the day of the meeting that he was resigning, despite previously saying he would be there.
Senators on the Appropriations Committee on Higher Education voted unfavorably on Rudman’s appointment last week. 
Rudman previously indicated he had a list of lawmakers who he said were violating drug laws and would release the names depending on how senators behaved in his confirmation hearings, according to Gaetz. Rudman posted from Barcelona on X over the weekend. 
Gaetz said he asked Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers to be prepared to take evidence and names from Rudman during the Tuesday morning meeting, “but Dr. Rudman has not favored us with his appearance.”

DeSantis’ controversial nominees
Much of the pushback stems around DeSantis’ stated desire to steer UWF in a more conservative direction. The eight appointees to the board by DeSantis and the Board of Governors in the span of a month helped elect Idaho professor Scott Yenor to chair the board. 
Senators have also complained about appointees who live outside of Florida — including Yenor in Idaho and Kissel in West Virginia.
Yenor faced backlash for advocating for fewer women in higher education and said that if only men won the Nobel Prize, “that’s not a failure. It’s kind of a cause for celebration,” The Associated Press reported.
Yenor resigned earlier this month, as has Gates Garcia, a private equity CEO from Tampa, while Sen. Gayle Harrell told the remaining trustees that the Senate would “be carefully watching the board of trustees at the University of West Florida.”
Senators had told Garcia he should come to the next committee hearing prepared to further defend his vote to make Yenor chair of the board. That chance never came. 
DeSantis said last week that UWF would see “big changes,” after boasting about the political overhaul of New College of Florida. 
UWF trustees Paul Bailey, Rebecca Matthews, Rachel Moya, Ashley Ross, and Chris Young were approved Tuesday and their nominations will head to the Senate floor, while Kissel’s will not.  
DeSantis has until 30 days after the legislative session to reappoint Kissel before he would have to vacate his seat. If reappointed, he must be confirmed next session. If not confirmed next session, he would have to leave the board.
During the committee meeting, senators asked UWF trustees whether they were concerned about “woke” administrators or teachings on campus — Sen. Tina Polsky, for example, asked whether UWF is “an indoctrination camp with marxist professors,” as DeSantis has alleged.
Ross called UWF “a tremendous diamond in the rough,” but also said, “I’m not here to ever disagree with the governor.” 
Bailey, Matthews, Moya, and Young said they saw no need for major changes in regards to administrative or political problems. 
“He has said he wants to take it over like he did New College, so the people who are on the board have to be willing to do that or have had conversations to be chosen to say, ‘I am willing to do that kind of takeover and change the whole atmosphere of a school,’” Polsky said, referring to the governor, asking Ross if he was part of the “overhaul.”
“My understanding of what I’m here to do today is to answer the questions that you have about my ability to serve as a university trustee,” Ross responded without directly answering the question.
Kissel faced questions in Higher Education Appropriations committee last month about his published writings expressing a desire to privatize public universities and grievances with the GI bill.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Planned Parenthood of Utah announced on Tuesday that thanks to “ongoing attacks from the Trump administration,” it’s been forced to restructure its operations, which includes closing two clinics — one in northern and one in southern Utah. 
On May 2, Planned Parenthood said it would be closing its Logan and St. George centers, which served about 4,500 patients last year. Plus, it said it would be cutting staff and increasing prices. 
“The painful decisions to close Logan and St. George health centers, reduce PPAU’s staff, and increase service fees are forced on us by the Trump administration,” said Sarah Stoesz, interim CEO of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. 
The nonprofit — which offers affordable sexual and reproductive health care, especially for low-income Utahns — said in a news release Tuesday that it had to make “several difficult operational decisions,” including the clinic closures, “to preserve the organization’s long-term sustainability and access to care for as many patients as possible.” 
Planned Parenthood of Utah officials said President Donald Trump’s administration’s withholding of $2.8 million in Title X funds forced them to take action. In addition to the closures, they said they also had to reduce “clinical and education staff” and up their prices.

“Unfortunately, without Title X funding, PPAU must also increase the sliding-fee scale for self-pay patients,” the news release said. “Simultaneously, PPAU will expand telehealth services to help connect patients in remote or rural areas to timely care.” 
Since 1985, Planned Parenthood of Utah has been the only recipient of Title X funding in the state. More than 26,000 low-income Utahns received low or no-cost services from Planned Parenthood thanks to that grant, according to the nonprofit. 
Last month, on March 31, the federal Health and Human Services’ Office of Population Affairs notified almost one in five Title X grantees across the country that their fourth year of funding (for a five-year period) would be “temporarily withheld,” according to KFF, a health policy research outlet. That freeze impacted all nine of Planned Parenthood’s grantees, plus seven other nonprofits. It’s not clear when or if that funding will be unfrozen. 
As part of that decision, all of Utah’s Title X funding was frozen. Planned Parenthood of Utah has eight clinics throughout the state.
The Trump administration said the funding freeze was aimed at enforcing executive orders on diversity and immigration. Federal officials gave Utah and the other impacted affiliates “10 days to submit detailed reports showing they don’t discriminate in hiring or patient care, but those who did so by the deadline said they have not received a response,” Politico reported Tuesday. The outlet also said the Trump administration did not respond to questions about the status of the funds. 
“It’s been radio silence,” Stoesz told Politico. “For some inexplicable reason, they are taking a meat axe to the healthcare system in America.”
Since Title X, the nation’s only federally-funded family planning program, was enacted in 1970 with bipartisan support, it has helped millions across the country access preventative health care, including birth control, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and cancer screenings. The program’s money cannot be used to fund abortions, according to Congress. 
“By withholding Title X funding from PPAU, the Trump administration is taking away essential health care from Utahns,” Stoesz said. 
Utah House passes bill to ban Planned Parenthood educators from schools

Still, Stoesz said in a prepared statement Tuesday that the nonprofit is “committed to making sure that everyone gets the health care they need when they need it, despite efforts by politicians to take it away.” 
“We know that we cannot show up for the communities who rely on us without making some challenging decisions now,” she said. 
By “consolidating our health care delivery and expanding telehealth, we will be in a better position to continue serving those who rely on us for health care,” Stoesz added. “While politicians in Washington are taking away people’s health care, Planned Parenthood is working tirelessly to keep our patients, families, and communities healthy.” 
Shireen Ghorbani, interim president of Planned Parenthood Association of Utah, said the organization has spent decades — 55 years — supporting Utahns and “future generations.” 
“This decision is heartbreaking and extremely difficult but necessary right now, so we can operate a sustainable organization that can continue to provide our community with essential health care and education,” said Ghorbani, who ran an unsuccessful Democratic bid to represent Utah in Congress in 2018. 
Despite the funding freeze, Ghorbani said Planned Parenthood of Utah will continue to provide services. 
“Our mission, coupled with the challenges of this moment — federal dismantling of health care, inflation, stagnant reimbursement rates — requires us to take serious and immediate cost-saving measures to protect the people we serve,” she said. “During this transition, our clinical staff will ensure our patients continue to get the same high-quality, trusted care they have come to expect.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline route as proposed in its permit application is “not viable,” South Dakota regulators determined Tuesday in Pierre. The Public Utilities Commission voted 2-1 to deny the company’s application, but Summit immediately pledged to reapply with a “reduced scope.”
It was the second South Dakota denial for Summit, which has been seeking a permit to build a portion of its proposed $9 billion pipeline through South Dakota since 2022. The commission denied the company’s first application in 2023, after which the company modified its route and reapplied.


Pipeline news in Iowa
Why hasn’t a pipeline bill come to Senate floor? Lawmakers blame opposing parties


The pipeline would carry carbon dioxide emissions captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota, where a Summit official has acknowledged some carbon could also be used to extract oil from old wells. The project seeks to capitalize on a broader federal push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and could qualify for federal tax credits tied to carbon sequestration.
Its path forward was complicated by the South Dakota Legislature’s passage of a carbon pipeline eminent domain ban, which was signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden in March. Eminent domain is a legal process that allows qualifying entities to acquire access to private land for projects in the public interest, with compensation for landowners determined by a court.
Summit had relied on that authority to survey land and secure access from property owners unwilling to sign voluntary easements.
A spokeswoman with the company vowed Tuesday in a prepared statement to refile an application for the project that “reflects a reduced scope and continued engagement with landowners and plant partners.”
Opposing landowners celebrate
Too many landowners at key points along the proposed route vowed to never sign an easement agreement for the project, rendering the application incomplete and ill prepared for the permitting process to continue, said Commissioner Kristie Fiegen during the meeting.
“Summit’s route is uncertain at this point,” Fiegen said. “We really don’t know the route. We don’t know the timeframes. We don’t know their plan.”
PUC staff said the permit could be denied because “substantive changes” will be needed to the application if the company can’t move forward with the route it has on file. Denying the application would then be “the cleanest path forward,” according to the staff’s filed recommendation.
Attorney Brian Jorde, representing landowners opposed to the project, said the application is impossible because “there’s nothing they can do to change these folks’ minds.” Seventy-nine South Dakota landowners declared they would never sign an easement, according to one of the commissioners.

“Is there another route?” Jorde said. “Yes, but not in this application.”
Property owners opposed to the pipeline applauded the commission’s decision. Ed Fischbach, a vocal critic of the project, said in a news release that the decision acknowledges “the company has run out of road to build” and frees landowners “to get on with their lives and businesses.”
But Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, who carried the successful eminent domain ban during the legislative session, said she has “a hard time believing” the project is over, especially if federal tax credits remain available.
The decision affirms that South Dakota is “open for business, but not for sale,” she said.
“If you have a great project and want to get it done in South Dakota, you should come in and do it the South Dakota way and people should be able to say yes or no to your project,” Lems said.
Summit officials ‘remain committed’ to state
The Public Utilities Commission instructed Summit earlier this month to present a plan to illustrate how the company can move forward – or not – under the new state law barring its use of eminent domain. At its previous meeting, the commission denied Summit’s request for a pause in permit proceedings.
Summit has permits in North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, but some of the permits are being challenged in court. Nebraska does not have a permitting process for the project. A bill to ban eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines is being considered in the Iowa statehouse.
Summit attorney Brett Koenecke opposed South Dakota regulators’ decision Tuesday, calling it “a prejudice” to the company pushed by opponents.
“You should ask yourselves why they’re fighting so hard to have this application denied and sent back,” Koenecke told commissioners. “I’d submit to you that the answer is likely they know it’s harder to restart.”
Commissioner Chris Nelson dissented from his colleagues Fiegen and Gary Hanson, arguing that Summit’s declaration that “they’re not going to challenge” the eminent domain ban, in addition to minor changes to the pipeline’s planned route, are enough for the project to move forward. 
Summit filed paperwork with the commission this month stating that it would rather work with its current application and route than seek court orders or refer the ban to the voters, adding that “threatening legal action is counter-productive to attempting to do business in good faith in the state.”
In a prepared statement, the Summit spokeswoman said company officials are “disappointed” in the commission’s decision but “remain committed” to South Dakota and the project.
“Without it the ethanol industry, farmers and land values in the state will all suffer,” she said.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)New Mexico health officials on Tuesday reported two new cases of measles, both in Lea County, bringing the state’s total to 65 measles cases this year spread across four counties.
Just over half of the cases in Lea, Eddy, Chavez and Doña Ana counties have been among children: with 18 cases in very young children aged 0 to four; 19 cases in school aged children; and 28 adult cases. The majority of cases, 61, are in Lea County, which neighbors Gaines County, Texas, the source of the outbreak that has infected more than 800 people as of Tuesday.
Texas health officials reported 624 cases Tuesday, an increase of 27 since last Friday.
The New Mexico Department of Health continues to urge vaccination, the most effective method to prevent contracting measles.
“Measles spread easily from person to person, which is why, despite small increases in positive case numbers as we saw in the past few days, we continue to encourage New Mexicans to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination – the best tool to protect yourself and those you love,” said NMDOH Communications Director Robert Nott.
Since Feb. 1, about 20,300 New Mexicans have received a vaccine, nearly double the 10,860 vaccinated in the same time frame last year.
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, spreads through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person. Symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, eye redness, fever and spotty red rash, may take weeks to develop. Approximately one in five measles cases becomes serious enough to require hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infection can cause serious complications including brain swelling, blindness or death.
Six hospitalizations have transpired over the course of the outbreak: five in Lea County and one in Doña Ana county, which reported its first case last week. The case may have exposed other people to measles in a Las Cruces daycare and hospital waiting rooms in early April, according to health officials.
NMDOH requests that anyone exposed or showing symptoms call the state’s measles helpline at 1-833-796-8773 for further vaccine information or measles testing available in  English or Spanish.
The department and hospitals are urging any exposed patients to contact doctor’s offices or emergency rooms before coming in.
In the early days of the measles outbreak, Nor-Lea Hospital in Lea County instituted procedures to prevent measles spread in the hospital, including requiring patients to mask up if experiencing symptoms or any exposures, minimizing spread and continuously disinfecting shared spaces.
Troy Clark, the CEO for the New Mexico Hospital Association, praised Nor-Lea for sharing the protocol with other hospitals, though he couldn’t say how many had adopted the same protocols.
“I think the collective efforts of our hospitals across the state provide high-quality care to protect our communities, keep them safe and healthy,” Clark told Source NM. “The means of collaboration one with another to learn from others’ experiences and to provide best practices, is intact, much like it was through the coronavirus pandemic.”
Amanda Schoenberg, a spokesperson for New Mexico Presbyterian Healthcare Services, which has nine hospitals across the state, said the hospitals were following guidance from state officials in a written statement.
“At Presbyterian, we follow guidance from the New Mexico Department of Health regarding highly contagious diseases and ask that any patients who suspect they may have measles contact their health care provider before visiting a clinic or hospital setting,” Schoenberg  wrote, “If a patient arrives at a facility and measles is suspected, they would be asked to mask and be placed in an isolated area. Vaccines are highly effective in protecting against measles and we encourage community members to access MMR vaccines if they have not yet been vaccinated”

Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 619 into law Tuesday, the bill providing funds for the state’s recovery efforts for 2024 floods and tornadoes as well as making changes to Iowa’s response system for future disasters.
The bill provides $13.6 million from the Iowa Economic Emergency Fund retroactively for fiscal year 2025 for response efforts to severe flooding and tornadoes. Reynolds said in a statement the bill will help Iowans and communities recovering from the major disasters in the past year that impacted more than 5,000 homes across the state.
“The tenacity of Iowans has been tested over the past year,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Our state faced devastating natural disasters in the spring of 2024—strong tornadoes and widespread flooding affected tens of thousands of Iowa families. To put it in perspective, our state was granted three Presidential disaster declarations in just two months. During this time of recovery, our relief programs have proven vital for Iowa families and communities to regain their footing and restart their lives.”

The legislation, introduced by the governor, was highlighted as one of her top priorities for the 2025 legislative session during her Condition of the State address in January.
A majority of funding from the bill, $11.6 million, goes to the Disaster Recovery Housing Assistance Program launched by the state in July. The other $2 million goes to the Nuisance Property and Abandoned Building Fund, which helps tear down buildings that damaged beyond repair by natural disasters. The law also will extend tax exclusions for developers building new housing in areas impacted by recent natural disasters.
The measure includes other components that Reynolds and lawmakers have said will help Iowa better respond to future natural disasters, including allowing the Iowa Department of Management to access 10% of the state’s Economic Emergency Fund each fiscal year for disaster recovery efforts when the governor issues a disaster proclamation.
The legislation also establishes the Natural Hazard Mitigation Financing program, a new loan program through the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the Iowa Finance Authority, to provide funding for “ongoing risk mitigation” projects that can help Iowa communities reduce damage in future severe weather events.
There was some pushback in subcommittee meetings on a component of the bill requiring appraisers, independent adjusters and umpires to be licensed to assess property damages. Advocates representing parties involved in the industry said most states do not have licensure in this field and could lead to fewer independent adjusters and umpires — the professionals who serve as a neutral party assessing damages and property value during insurance claim processes — practicing in Iowa. The measure was not changed by lawmakers.
The law is effective immediately.

Tax breaks could soon be coming to Montanans, but not in the form of property tax relief — at least not yet. Instead, the Montana Legislature on Friday passed a bill cutting income taxes and increasing the earned income tax credit, sending the measure to the governor’s desk. 
House Bill 337, sponsored by Speaker of the House Rep. Brandon Ler, R-Savage, ended up as a compromise between the governor’s preferred plan for the largest tax cut in state history and a middle-class tax cut preferred by a more conservative wing of the GOP and some Democrats.
Under current Montana income tax laws, there are two tax brackets for regular income — a 4.7% bracket and a 5.9% bracket — which splits at $21,100 for single filers and $42,200 for joint filers. 
The new system would increase the threshold for the lower tax rate during the next two tax years so that single filers would pay the 4.7% rate on their first $47,500 in 2026, and $65,000 in 2027. For joint filers, they would pay 4.7% on their first $95,000 of income in 2026 and on the first $130,000 in 2027. 
Above those thresholds, taxpayers would pay a top tax rate of 5.65% in 2026 and 5.4% in 2027.
The increased income threshold would also apply to long-term capital gains income, which is taxed at 3.1% and 4% rates. 
“Montanans work hard for their money, and HB 337, ensures they keep more of it—now and in the future. HB 337 delivers real, meaningful income tax relief for working families across our state,” Ler said in a press release following the Senate vote. 
The bill also increases the Earned Income Tax Credit from 10% of the federal EITC to 20%. 
The Senate passed the bill without any amendments from the upper chamber on Friday to expedite its path to the governor’s desk. All Senate Republicans supported the bill, while all Democrats opposed it due to the cost of lowering the top tax rate. 
Sen. Dave Fern, D-Whitefish, said he wants to see taxes as low as possible. However, while he was campaigning for office, he said he didn’t hear anyone asking for income tax cuts. 
With property tax relief still left to be hammered out by the Legislature — which Fern said he was expecting to be a costly endeavor — spending more money on income tax cuts is not the direction he wants the chambers to take. 
According to the bill’s fiscal note, the income tax breaks will decrease the state’s general fund collections by $20 million during the 2026 fiscal year; $190 million during 2027 and increasing to $277 million by 2029.
“$277 million is a little bit too much,” Fern said. “I’m going to oppose this bill because I think that it’s well meaning, but it’s just too expensive.” 
The compromise bill costs roughly $40 million per year less than the governor’s preferred plan starting in 2027. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte has long touted his plan to bring about the largest income tax cut in state history by cutting the top income rate — which most Montanans are subject to — by a full percentage point over the biennium, and pairing that with an increase of the EITC to 15% to target lower-income residents. 
However, his plan met resistance in the Legislature. 
A plan backed by Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, and more conservative Republicans in the Senate, would have kept the top rate in place, but greatly expand the threshold where the top rate would kick in — by more than twice what Ler’s bill did. 
Another bill, introduced by Democrats, would have created an income-based tax credit targeting exclusively the lower and middle-income taxpayers. 
Both bills were tabled in the House Taxation Committee earlier this month. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee, previously criticized the governor’s plan because it “started at the top.” But he called HB 337, as a compromise, “a good bill for everyone.” 
The final income tax package seems to appease all factions in the government — by reducing the top rate and increasing the EITC as the governor wanted, while targeting middle-class Montanans, as was the target of Democrats and conservative Republicans. 
But the governor, who has spoken extensively about the desire to deliver a larger tax cut for Montanans, still has the final say.   
“I still believe our income tax cut is the most conservative proposal before the Legislature, reducing the tax that most Montanans pay, benefiting Montanans at every single income level,” Gianforte said at a press conference last Thursday, before HB 337 had passed the Senate. “While I know there’s a lot of different ideas out there, we must keep this principle at the top of our minds. The money belongs to the people of Montana and not the government.”
The governor’s office did not respond to questions about whether Gianforte supports the compromise bill or will sign it.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/incometaxpressconference-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-04-22 18:09:33.590956

Mike Harris (R-Waterford) and Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn). Michigan House photo.In a nearly unanimous vote, Michigan lawmakers in the state House passed a $115 million annual public safety fund aimed to decrease violent crime in communities.
One of the sponsors for the bills to implement a Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund to fund local law enforcement agencies and community violence intervention groups around the state, Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) told media after the 104-4 vote on HBs 4260 and 4261 that preventing crime looks a lot different today than it did 30 years ago.
In having conversations with his partner in the effort to secure the fund, co-sponsor Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford), Farhat said it’s clear that the expectations and public demand for law enforcement to work in prevention, not just focusing on enforcement of law has made policing more and more expensive.

“Go visit these departments. You will not see desk officers like you used to anymore. You’re seeing everybody out on patrol. You’re seeing people walking in neighborhoods… you’re also seeing a demand for officers to do more than just drive a car around and pull somebody over for speeding. You’re seeing investigative units, forensics units, that are doing online human trafficking cases… really sophisticated, really expensive stuff,” Farhat said. “There’s some cruel people out there in this world that we have to get to and we have to prevent them from preying on, whether it’s young children or our seniors, and that’s expensive.”
Harris and Farhat have been urging their colleagues in Michigan’s partisanly split legislature to put people over politics and approve the Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund which law enforcement leaders from around the state have said will allow them to hire more staff and strengthen gun violence prevention programs like some in Detroit which have reduced violent crime in some neighborhoods by up to 70%, according to the city.

We work hard to support the economy of this state, working long hours for low wages, doing work that U.S. citizens don’t want to do.”Will Lambek, a spokesperson for Migrant Justice, said in an interview that “most of the workers were detained in their homes on farm property.”In a written statement to VTDigger, Amanda St. Pierre, co-owner of the dairy, confirmed that the incident had taken place but said she “did not know the details or reasons at this time.” “We have fully cooperated with (CBP’s) instructions. Our employees were hired following the federal and state employment requirements,” St. Pierre said. “We remain supportive of our employees and appreciative of the valuable role they play in our community performing essential work on our farm. We hope this matter is resolved quickly.”According to Lambek, one of the workers is currently in asylum proceedings, a process he had already initiated prior to his arrest. The immigration statuses of the other individuals are unclear. Located just south of the Canadian border, Pleasant Valley Farms is Vermont’s largest dairy farm. The incident represents the largest immigration enforcement action against migrant workers in Vermont in recent memory.“I have long been clear: migrant workers are an essential part of our communities,” Gov. Phil Scott said in a Tuesday press release following the incident. “They are our neighbors and friends, have kids in our schools, shop at our businesses, and play an important role in our economy and workforce.” That statement was echoed by Anson Tebetts,  secretary of Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, in an interview.“I think it’s important for Vermonters to understand that, migrant workers, they do play essential roles at dairy farms and farms across Vermont — and not only Vermont but across the country,” Tebetts said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  US Border Patrol arrests 8 migrant workers at Berkshire dairy.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tqQg8-richford-vt.png?fit=1024%2C831&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Less than a month after canceling in-person town halls due to safety concerns, Rep. Harriet Hageman has restarted the process, though you’ll have to register to attend. 
The post Hageman quietly resumes in-person town halls appeared first on WyoFile .","Less than a month after canceling in-person town halls due to safety concerns, Rep. Harriet Hageman has restarted the process, albeit somewhat quietly and with restrictions on who can attend.
Hageman has scheduled a town hall for Thursday in Buffalo and another for the following day in Dayton. She circulated invites for the two events via her newsletter. The town halls are not listed on her website’s events page, and in her newsletter, Hageman said only those who register will be allowed in.
In late March, Hageman announced she was moving her town halls online, shortly after a raucous event in Laramie where she was booed and heckled by people upset by the actions of President Donald Trump and the billionaire Elon Musk. Hageman’s staff at the time cited “credible threats to Hageman, and the related national outbursts of politically motivated violence and attempts at intimidation.”
Hageman’s staff did not immediately respond Tuesday to an email from WyoFile requesting comment on what was behind her quiet return to in-person town halls. 
As of April 22, 2025 at 2:34 p.m. details about upcoming town halls in Buffalo or Dayton were not listed on Rep. Harriet Hageman’s events calendar. (screenshot of https://hageman.house.gov/about/events/calendar)
The two-term lawmaker consistently held such events throughout her time in office. It is only since Trump returned to power that Hageman’s town halls have drawn both national media attention and heat from people upset at the direction the federal government has taken.
Republican lawmakers nationwide have faced anger and indignation from their constituents when they’ve returned from Washington, D.C. to their home states, as the Musk-led DOGE initiative continues to sharply reduce and restructure government programs. 
On March 20, Hageman faced a crowd of more than 500 people who jeered and swore at the congresswoman during a tense town hall in Laramie. She faced more pushback in Wheatland the next night, and, according to a statement she issued canceling further in-person town halls, “an attendee followed Hageman leaving the venue and initiated a physical confrontation with staff.” Wheatland police had to get involved in that incident, Hageman’s statement said. 
At the time, she said her town halls would remain virtual “at least in the short-term.” WyoFile has submitted a public records request for police reports from the Wheatland incident, but has yet to receive any records. 
Hageman cast the people who heckled her in Laramie and elsewhere as organized protesters, and some conservatives falsely suggested they had come into the state from elsewhere to flood the events — or were even paid protesters. Wyoming Democrats pushed back on those assertions and accused Hageman of seeking to dismiss constituents’ deep concerns about the Trump administration’s actions.
Yet, her new, lower-key town halls have not escaped the opposition party’s attention. On Facebook, the Sheridan County Democrats called on their members to sign up to attend the town halls, or bring signs and picket outside. “Be as civil as you can manage,” the post instructed. 
The town hall in Buffalo is being held at the Bomber Mountain Civic Center at 6:30 p.m. Thursday. Those who wish to attend can register here. 
The town hall in Dayton is being held at 6:30 p.m. at the Dayton Community Center. Those who wish to attend can register here. 
Hageman’s newsletter invited those who “live in the county in which the town hall is scheduled and would like to attend” to register. It’s unclear if only residents from Johnson and Sheridan counties will be granted entry, and Hageman’s staff did not respond to a WyoFile inquiry on that point.

Laura Kelly calls for vaccination surge to counter measles spread in southwest Kansas,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/04/22/gov-laura-kelly-calls-for-vaccination-surge-to-counter-measles-spread-in-southwest-kansas/,"Gov. Laura Kelly, Sen. Bill Clifford and KDHE's chief medical officer ask southwest Kansas residents to get measles vaccinations to counter spread of virus.","Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly joined Republican Sen. Bill Clifford of Garden City to urge residents of southwest Kansas, especially children, to be vaccinated for measles amid spread of the virus to eight counties. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has confirmed 37 cases of measles, but the total could be higher. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly said three-dozen confirmed cases of measles in southwest Kansas necessitated a plea Tuesday for children and adults to get vaccinated and for people with symptoms to avoid spreading the virus by staying away from public places.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced March 13 the first confirmed case of measles in the state since 2008. The number of confirmed cases climbed to 37 within a cluster of eight counties, state officials said, but the expectation was the number of higher because not everyone who contracted measles visited a health department, clinic or hospital.
“This measles outbreak is serious,” Kelly said during a news conference in Garden City. “It reminds us that the health of our communities, and especially of our children, depends on all of us to recognize our collective responsibility to each other.”
She recalled that during her youth it wasn’t uncommon for children to get measles. Some became quite ill and were hospitalized, suffered permanent health complications or died, she said. Widespread acceptance of the measles, mumps and rubella or MMR vaccine for children and adults served the public good by providing immunity in communities, she said.
Vaccine hesitancy, a phenomenon driven by misinformation, undercut adherence to important public health recommendations, the governor said.
“Measles spreads to our classrooms, our churches, our recreation centers and our grocery stores,” Kelly said. “It lingers in the air and it causes real harm. Yet, no parent wants their child in the hospital over something we know how to prevent.”
She said the vaccine was 93% effective in preventing measles with one dose and 97% effective with the recommended second dose. In some regions of the state, the governor said, vaccination rates have fallen below 90%.
Symptoms of measles typically began with a high fever, cough, runny nose as well as red, watery eyes. Three to five days after symptoms began, a skin rash could develop starting on the face and spreading to the neck, trunk, arms and legs.
 
The doctors
Physician Dereck Totten, who serves as chief medical officer for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said the outbreak expanded primarily among unvaccinated individuals. He said 37 confirmed cases were confined to Finney County and seven other counties in southwest Kansas. Thirty confirmed cases involved unvaccinated patients, he said.
“The vaccine is absolutely our bests defense against this outbreak,” Totten said. “Measles is an extremely contagious disease, and it spreads very rapidly.”
Totten said the virus could be spread when an infected person coughed, sneezed or talked. When a person with measles exposed others, the doctor said, nine of 10 people without immunity could be expected to catch the virus. Immunity also could be acquired by having measles in the past, he said.
He recommended children typically get the first vaccination at 12 months to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 years to 6 years of age.
However, he said KDHE was recommending an early extra dose at 6 months of age for babies in the eight affected counties of Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray, Haskell, Kiowa, Morton and Stevens. KDHE extended this recommendation to the 14 counties bordering the eight-county cluster tied to the measles outbreak.
“I can’t stress enough how important it is to receive that MMR vaccine to protect yourself, your family and loved ones and those in your community against this outbreak,” Totten said.
Sen. Bill Clifford, a Garden City Republican and ophthalmologist, said the official total of measles in Kansas underestimated the threat. He urged children and adults not yet vaccinated for measles to get MMR shots.
“I view this as the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We do report 37 cases, but if you talk to anyone in health care there are several people sitting at home with red spots, while one person who’s sick is coming to the emergency room. Realize that it’s out there. It is very contagious. If you’re not vaccinated, you ought to be.”
Clifford said Kansans should model their appreciation of public health through the eyes of Samuel Crumbine, a physician who practiced in Garden City. Crumbine sought to restrain communicable diseases such as tuberculosis by improving hygiene, ending the practice of sharing towels in restrooms and by deterring reliance on common drinking cups.
“Many haven’t heard of him,” Clifford said. “He’s viewed as the father of public health.”
 
Misinformation
The governor attributed reemergence of measles in Kansas to spread of misinformation that convinced some people to avoid vaccines. The anti-vaccination movement undermined the ability of communities to fight off infectious disease, she said.
Organizations opposed to public vaccination campaigns convinced Kansas legislators to support laws exempting people from COVID-19 vaccines. On April 11, the Legislature voted to send the governor a bill that included a religious exemption for vaccination mandates. House Bill 2045 was formally presented to the governor April 18, and she could veto it without consequence because the House and Senate adjourned for the year.
“In recent years,” Kelly said, “the Legislature has chipped away at the public health tools communities rely on. They have made it harder for schools and local health departments to act quickly when outbreaks occur. We need those tools back. But even without them, we’re not powerless.”
The governor said the first town in the United States to line up in 1955 for the polio vaccine was Protection, Kansas.
“Those families trusted science,” Kelly said. “They trusted one another. And, they took action to keep their children and their neighbors safe. They didn’t ask who the president was or who got credit. They just wanted to protect their kids in their community. We need that same kind of response now.”
She said mothers, fathers, grandparents and other caregivers might have questions about the measles vaccine. Caution was a normal instinct, she said.
“You do not have to do this alone. Talk to your doctor. Ask questions. Get the facts and then make a plan,” the governor said. “This is not political. It is not about ideology. It is about protecting the kids at your kitchen table in your community.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1142520-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-22 18:09:33.590956

(Photo via Getty Images)Lawmakers sent bills to the governor’s desk Tuesday creating residency requirements for the University of Iowa medical and dental schools and a scholarship program for Iowa National Guard members, as well as advancing separate bills dealing with higher education.
The House gave final approval to House File 516, requiring the University of Iowa doctor of medicine and dental programs to enroll at least 80% resident students or those who meet other qualifications. The House concurred with an amendment from the Senate and passed the legislation with a vote of 61-30.
Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, expressed concerns that language in the amended bill requiring the UI to report to the General Assembly why certain students weren’t accepted is a legislative overreach, but added she understands how “reasonable people can have disagreements on this policy.”

Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said language in the bill is based on similar legislation in Minnesota, Georgia, Texas and South Dakota.
“The public institution should be required to provide public information regarding policies,” Meyer said. “This is a part of a package of growing our own training physicians and retaining them.”
National Guard scholarships
House File 117, which would establish a professional qualification scholarship program for members of the National Guard, also awaits Reynolds’ signature after receiving unanimous votes in the House and Senate.
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said during closing remarks on the bill more and more prospective National Guard members are seeking certifications rather than four-year degrees in areas like technology and health care, and the new program will give the Guard a new tool for recruitment.
“Offering this program will help our National Guard to be able to better recruit individuals and assist them with an education that will help meet the needs of the Guard as well as the desires of the service members,” Salmon said.
Accommodations for pregnant students
Senate File 288 would require state universities and community colleges to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant students or those who have recently given birth, including allowing students to reschedule tests and assignments as well as take a leave of absence without penalty.
Pregnant students and new parents would also be allowed extra time to complete tests and degree programs if needed, according to the legislation.
An amendment introduced by Rep. Tracy Ehlert, D-Cedar Rapids, to include students with chronic illnesses and other qualifications to the bill failed to pass. She said the bill without the amendment was a good step in recognizing the diversity of Iowa university students, but it doesn’t go far enough.
“Let’s ensure that all students are successful during … their college career,” Ehlert said.
Floor manager Rep. Bob Henderson, R-Sioux City, also introduced an amendment defining qualifying students as “biologically female” and removing language setting a 12-month timeframe for some of the listed accommodations and replacing it with a reasonable amount of time decided upon by the student and institution.
The amendment passed and the legislation was sent back to the Senate with a unanimous vote.
“We have the opportunity to pass a bill here that provides an opportunity for everybody, both the institution for academic integrity, as well as obviously, for students who are pregnant or with children,” Henderson said.
Data reporting and employee contracts
House File 890 would shift program-level data reporting by community colleges to the Iowa Department of Education and have the Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Department of Education develop an annual compensation schedule and set employee benefits for all employees of the Iowa Educational Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired and Iowa School for the Deaf.
An amendment introduced by floor manager Sen. Jeff Taylor and adopted by the Senate clarified the applicability of community college instructor contract terms, Taylor said. The amendment and legislation passed unanimously and the bill returns to the House for consideration of the Senate amendment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-22 21:34:55+00:00,CT Mirror,New England power demand fell to an all-time low on Easter,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/ne-iso-easter-new-england-power-demand/,Officials say the proliferation of energy-efficient devices and rooftop solar panels is driving down the demand on the electric grid.,"Demand on New England’s power grid fell to an all-time low on Sunday afternoon as sunny skies and mild temperatures zapped residents’ need for electricity.
According to preliminary data from the region’s grid operator, ISO New England, power system demand across the six-state region fell to 5,318 megawatts between roughly 1 and 2 p.m. as temperatures across much of the area reached into the 60s.
That beat the region’s previous record low of 6,596 megawatts, which was set last April.  
It’s not uncommon for demand on the grid to wane during the spring and fall — often referred to as the “shoulder” months — when milder temperatures lessen the need for energy-intensive heating and cooling. Grid operators attributed Sunday’s record to favorable weather as well as the Easter holiday
“This is the fourth year that we’ve seen a record low, but the difference between last year’s record low and this one was a pretty good jump,” said Mary Cate Colapietro, a spokeswoman for ISO New England. 
By contrast, demand on the the grid reached its all-time high on Aug. 2, 2006 with 28,130 megawatts of power needed.
The proliferation of energy-efficient technologies and rooftop solar panels is also helping to drive down the need to pull electricity off the grid.
On Sunday afternoon, for example, grid operators estimated that behind-the-meter solar panels generated a peak of roughly 6,600 megawatts of electricity — more power than the entire system was drawing from power plants.
As the sun set that evening and solar panels stopped producing electricity, the demand for power in New England more than doubled, reaching of peak of around 11,800 megawatts.
“Such days are not disruptive from a grid operations perspective,” ISO New England said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the grid’s “sophisticated modeling and forecasting methods allow system operators to anticipate and prepare for low demand levels.” 
Lower demand on the grid also allows the owners of larger power plants to relax production and perform maintenance, with renewable sources available to pick up the slack. 
In March, for the first time, renewable sources of electricity surpassed fossil fuels to supply more than half of the U.S.’ electricity demands, according to the energy think tank Ember.
On Sunday, power production from nuclear, hydroelectric and other renewable sources in New England briefly accounted for more than two-thirds of the region’s power, supplanting natural gas. 
Despite the strides of the last several years in reducing power demand, ISO New England predicts that electricity use across the region will increase more than 17% by 2033, driven by the electrification of cars and home heating systems, along with the growth of data centers and artificial intelligence projects.
Peak demand during the winter and summer months is also expected to grow over the next decade, according to operators.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Millstone-from-The-Day.jpg,,,2025-04-22 18:09:33.590956

His body was expected to be taken to Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington for an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of his death, Rutland City Police Chief Brian Kilcullen said early Tuesday afternoon. “This incident is being investigated as a homicide,” Rutland police said in a press release later Tuesday afternoon. The details and circumstances surrounding Rodrigues’ death were still being investigated, the release added. Investigators have interviewed several people, but no one was in custody as of about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to the release.“We believe this was an isolated incident, targeted for whatever reason, yet to be determined,” Kilcullen said. “We don’t believe the public is at any risk related to this.” Police said they were called to the Summer Street apartment building around 2:45 a.m. Tuesday for a “reported shooting incident.” Responding officers found a deceased man, later identified as Rodrigues, who had been shot at the scene, Kilcullen said. “We secured the scene and began our investigation,” the police chief said, adding that Rutland Police contacted the Vermont State Police for assistance processing the scene. “They collected evidence and documented the scene.” The street remained open to traffic, but the Rutland City police department issued a press release to request the public to avoid the area due to the heavy police presence at the scene during the investigation.The apartment building at 43 Summer St. was cordoned off by caution tape, and neighbors watched the scene from afar. Investigators could be seen entering and exiting the building, and police officers were stationed outside. Annya Lamothe, a 37-year-old Rutland resident and teacher, said that she has lived on Summer Street for nine years and is concerned for the safety of her three children after the incident amid increasing crime in the area.    “Hopefully the cops can buckle down and do what we can do to keep our kids safe,” Lamothe said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Police call death of Rutland man in apartment building a homicide; no one in custody.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0714-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Current House Speaker Cameron Sexton of Crossville tops the list of potential witnesses, along with House Republican Whip Johnny Garrett of Goodlettsville. 
Sexton confirmed early in the investigation that he has been cooperating with prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney’s office. In March, the defense team alleged the government was withholding information about the identity of people who secretly gathered information and that Sexton wore a wire to record conversations between him, Casada and Cothren.
Other House Republicans on the list of witnesses who could be called are Reps. Justin Lafferty of Knoxville, Jay Reedy of Erin, Jason Zachary of Knoxville, Dennis Powers of LaFollette, Scott Cepicky of Culleoka, Tim Rudd and Charlie Baum of Murfreesboro and Esther Helton-Haynes of East Ridge.

Casada and Cothren were indicted in August 2022 on 20 counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, bribery and kickbacks after funneling contracts for political consulting services for House members to a company founded by Cothren called Phoenix Solutions. 
Former Chattanooga Rep. Robin Smith, whose home and office were raided by the FBI in 2021 — along with those of Casada and several other lawmakers — pleaded guilty to charges in the case and is expected to testify after agreeing to cooperate with federal prosecutors.
 Casada turned down plea deal
Most of Tuesday was devoted to jury selection, but U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson asked Casada about his understanding of a plea deal offering from the U.S. Attorney’s office. 
“Did (Casada’s attorneys) communicate they received a plea offer from the government?” Richardson asked Casada. 
The former House speaker said he was aware of the deal offering and declined to accept it. No mention was made of a similar plea offer to Cothren.
Prosecutors say Casada and former Rep. Smith knew Cothren was operating the firm under the alias “Matthew Phoenix” but withheld that information from state lawmakers and – in return for kickbacks – directed them to enlist the bogus firm to provide direct mail services. 
Cothren resigned from Casada’s office following 2019 media reports of his involvement in a racist and sexist texting scandal. Casada later stepped down as House Speaker — his eight months in the position marked the shortest tenure for a Tennessee Speaker of the House — after a ‘no confidence’ vote from members of the House Republican Caucus. 
Richardson clarified with both sets of lawyers the need to conceal Cothren’s identity stemmed from the scandal, which enveloped Casada’s speakership and led to his resignation along with complaints about heavy-handed management.

“The witnesses wouldn’t have done business if they’d known” Cothren was behind the firm, said Taylor Phillips, assistant U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee.
“What (House members) cared about was that it was Cade Cothren who was the subject of this enormous scandal,” Phillips said.
Cynthia Sherwood, attorney for Cothren, said Casada and Smith were the driving forces behind the firm’s ability to secure business from elected officials. 
“None of these witnesses did business with Phoenix Solutions,” Sherwood said. “They hired Robin Smith, they hired Glen Casada because they were friends.”
Opening arguments in the case are expected to begin Wednesday after jury selection is concluded.

Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a gun safety rally at the state Capitol Building on April 22, 2025 | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsThoughts and prayers didn’t save lives in Michigan, but a slate of gun safety measures that became law after the state suffered two mass shootings will continue to reduce gun violence, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told a crowd of gun violence prevention advocates and survivors at a rally at the Capitol in Lansing Tuesday.
The pain of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School, where four students were killed, and the 2023 shooting at Michigan State University, where three students were killed, will not soon be forgotten, Whitmer said, especially as other states and schools continue to experience the same tragic sting. 
After taking a moment of silence for the individuals wounded and killed last week in a shooting at Florida State University, Whitmer thanked the advocates present, some of whom are survivors of Oxford and MSU, for being the driving force behind Michigan implementing sweeping gun safety reforms that went into action in February of last year.

Those measures included requirements to lock up unattended firearms when a minor could reasonably access it, the implementation of universal background checks for all gun sales in Michigan, extending temporary bans on firearm possession for those convicted of domestic violence offenses and creating “red flag” laws to allow judges to issue extreme risk protection orders, or ERPOs, to temporarily remove firearms from the possession of individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.
“This movement was powered by people, by students, by those of us who are fed up and tired of watching gun violence ravage our communities and our homes and our school districts and our neighborhoods. We owe it to victims, survivors, parents, teachers and students to end this epidemic,” Whitmer said.

At least 31 individuals who had an ERPO issued against them were charged with criminal offenses within 30 days of the entry for the ERPO, with the most common offense they were charged with being domestic violence.
Researchers have long called attention to the lethal combination access to firearms and domestic violence make, with several medical experts and researchers asserting that domestic violence victims are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if there is a gun accessible to them.
And as many domestic violence service providers in Michigan have witnessed intimate partner violence become more violent and more lethal since the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a particular focus at the rally Tuesday on the impact of gun violence in domestic violence.
A survivor of domestic violence, Faith Brown, said she gathered up the courage to leave her husband who had been abusing her and her four children and served him with divorce papers and was looking forward to getting her life back. But on September 21, 2016 she came home to find her husband waiting for her with a gun.

Eight years later and Brown is now an advocate for other women who have experienced intimate partner violence, which so often involves gun violence, crediting First Step Domestic & Sexual Violence Services in Wayne County for providing counseling and support as she fought to continue with her life.
“At some point, I decided that I needed to live again. It was what my children would have wanted,” Brown said. “Nothing can bring back my children, but I can do everything in my power to make sure no other woman, no other family, has to go through what I did, no one else should have to lose what I lost.”
As the Michigan Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, established through an executive order by Whitmer, released recommendations Tuesday to decrease firearm-related deaths and injuries, Whitmer told the crowd she looks forward to reviewing the policies and pursuing elected leaders and advocates in implementing more gun safety policies in Michigan.
“Every shooting, every life lost, every community grieving demands not just our attention and thoughts and prayers, but our action,” Whitmer said. “I’m ready to work with you and anyone who wants to protect public safety, reduce gun violence, because this is about partnership, not partisanship.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House bill inspired by frustrations with state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ leadership of the Oklahoma State Board of Education now is at risk of failing as it approaches a crucial deadline without yet passing through its assigned Senate committee.
The Senate Education Committee met Tuesday for the final time before a Thursday deadline to advance House bills to the full Senate. The committee did so without considering House Bill 1491, which would allow members of school boards, including the state Board of Education, to place topics on their meeting agendas by submitting a written request.
The committee’s leader, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, was critical of the bill, saying it would treat the state Board of Education differently from all other statewide boards and commissions. Pugh, as chairperson, decides which bills the committee will consider for a vote.
“I want to treat that state board like we would any other government agency,” Pugh said after Tuesday’s meeting. “And so, we have to ensure a fairly applied law, and I’m not sure that that’s what that bill achieved.”

House lawmakers drafted the bill after some of the governor’s recent appointees to the state Board of Education said they were frustrated that only Walters controlled what agenda items the board could discuss during its meetings. 
The state superintendent, who is elected, leads the board and the Oklahoma State Department of Education, both of which oversee the state’s public schools system.
Gov. Kevin Stitt and top Republican leaders in the House and Senate endorsed the measure, and it passed a vote by the full House with overwhelming bipartisan support. At the time the bill was filed, Stitt said one member shouldn’t have unilateral control over the whole board.
The Governor’s Office did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, declined to comment on the stalled bill. 
HB 1491 from Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada, would have allowed two members on the state board or any local school board with five or more positions to place an item on an upcoming meeting agenda with a written request. It would have taken only one member to request an agenda item on school boards with four or fewer members.
Current state law doesn’t outline any method for state Board of Education officials to have input on their meeting agendas. School boards that have an at-large board chair position, found in districts with at least 30,000 students, can add agenda items with a request from a majority of board members.
  Oklahoma State Board of Education member Chris Vandenhende, pictured Feb. 27, requested the board schedule a future meeting to consider suspending “all activity related to immigration. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
State Board of Education member Chris Vandenhende proposed during a February meeting that the panel schedule a future vote to “suspend all activity related to immigration.” His request referred to a rule the board had approved the month before that would require schools to collect and report students’ immigration status.
But, Walters has the final say on what topics the board will discuss. An agenda for its March meeting didn’t include Vandenhende’s request or any reference to immigration. 
The board ultimately canceled its March meeting because the agenda was posted online 19 minutes after a legally required deadline.
Pugh said he is supportive of board members expressing dissent but questioned whether lawmakers had considered the possibility of “unintended consequences” and disruption from HB 1491.
“You could just be creating gridlock and chaos on that board, and that’s not healthy for the state either because they have a really important role to play,” Pugh said.

Bill Pluecker (I-Warren) said it's critical to test for PFAS, which have been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more. (Photo by Getty Images)The Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee held a public hearing Tuesday afternoon for three bills seeking to better identify forever chemicals in private wells and address their presence in certain public water systems. 
“No family should be left in the dark about what’s in their water,” said Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren), when introducing LD 500. 
Pluecker’s proposal would add perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly called PFAS, to the list of contaminants the Department of Health and Human Services recommends testing for in private wells. Additionally, it seeks to use money from the department’s Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory account to provide free well water testing for low-income residents. 
A similar proposal died last year due to concerns over that proposal’s use of general funds to support the program, but Pluecker said he believed the department’s dedicated fund should be sufficient to avoid the need for other state dollars. 
More than half of Mainers get drinking water from private, residential wells, so Pluecker said it’s critical to test for PFAS, which have been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more.
Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono) also introduced a similar proposal to expand testing for PFAS substances in private drinking wells, which aren’t regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Landlords are already required to test for arsenic in wells that provide drinking water and share the test results with tenants within 10 days of being notified of the results. LD 493 would build upon that by requiring landlords to also test the water for PFAS, lead, uranium and other potentially harmful contaminants. 
While the landlord would not be required to treat any contamination, they would have to disclose it to tenants and potential tenants within 10 days of receiving results. Similarly, the bill would require residential owners to disclose any water tests that indicate the presence of PFAS when selling the property. 
The version of this bill introduced last session died on the special appropriations table, where bills are chosen by the budget committee for funding, with a fiscal note of a little more than $100,000 per year. 
The health committee also heard a proposal from Rep. Daniel Shagoury (D-Hallowell) that targets forever chemicals in public water systems throughout the state. LD 1326 would establish maximum PFAS levels in the drinking water of certain public water systems that serve settings such as schools, factories, industrial parks or office buildings.
The Department of Health and Human Services is currently in the process of adopting rules that align with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulation announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in April 2024. Those new federal standards create enforceable limits for six PFAS in drinking water that can have adverse health effects. 
Shagoury acknowledged that the department is opposed to his bill for being duplicative, but he argued it would  underscore the Legislature’s belief that standards for PFAS in drinking water are important. 
The Maine Water Utilities Association also opposed the bill because it said Maine has adopted federal water standards rather than creating its own statute to make compliance with federal standards less burdensome. Changing that and adopting LD 1326 would create complexity and confusion for water systems, said Mike Cummons, who works for the Maine Water Company in Saco.

The bills (HB 7027 & 7029), sponsored by Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman, are different in some respects to the Senate version that passed unanimously in that chamber two weeks ago — most significantly in that it puts a 15% excise tax on the sale of all such products.
Another difference with the Senate version is that it doesn’t ban consumption of Delta-8, the hemp-derived THC product that has grown in popularity since hemp was legalized in the United States through the 2018 U.S. farm bill.
The House bill would limit the amount of THC in derived products. Regarding hemp-infused drinks, beverages cannot contain more than 5 milligrams of THC hemp per 6-ounce contains. The bill limits “inhalables” (such as joints and vaping machines) and edibles to 5 milligrams per serving (an increase of 2.5 milligrams from last week’s version).
Another provision would prohibit anyone from receiving more than 100 milligrams of hemp-derived THC in a single 24-hour period.
The bill  would prohibit any individual from ingesting hemp consumable THC products within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school between 6 a.m. and midnight. A violator would be subjected to a $25 fine or 50 hours of community service.
Rep. Salzman amended her bill from last week in two key respects: It would now allow places like gas stations to sell hemp-infused THC drinks and it would not place any limitations on non-intoxicating CBD products.
Three-year attempt
This is the third year in a row in which lawmakers have spent considerable time and energy attempting to regulate intoxicating hemp-derived THC products, which have grown in popularity since the state legalized the product in 2019.
Regulations passed during last year’s session but were vetoed by Gov. Ron DeSantis after heavy lobbying by members of the hemp industry. As a way to show their appreciation, a number of hemp entrepreneurs sent funds to the Republican Party of Florida and other groups organized to oppose Amendment 3, the constitutional amendment that, if passed, would have legalized recreational cannabis for all adults 21 and over.
For whatever reason, many of those same hemp entrepreneurs who regularly testified in opposition to those proposals filed in the 2023 and 2024 legislative sessions have been absent from the public debate as the bills have moved through their respective chambers this spring. But that détente ended on Tuesday, as people who work in the hemp industry testified before the House Commerce Committee that the proposal would severely affect their bottom lines.
JJ Coombs, who operates three hemp businesses based out of Fort Lauderdale, said a problem with the House legislation is that  it would put the same limits on the amount of THC in both edibles and inhalables.
“They are completely different products,’ he said. “Edibles are consumed in a single serving while inhalabales are consumed over a period of time, often going weeks without having to purchase another device.”
Patrick Shatzer of Sunmed/Your CBD Store summarized the letter accompanying DeSantis’ veto; the governor wrote that that bill would “impose debilitating regulatory burdens on small businesses and almost certainly fail to achieve its purposes.”
“The intent is to stop intoxicating [elements] and to stop bad actors,” Shatzer said. “These laws are not going to allow the good actors to operate.”
Lobbyists for alcohol interests expressed disappointment that the legislation does not allow for individuals to drink hemp-infused THC beverages at the establishment where they buy such products.  Scott Difford, with Delta Beverages, said his products are sold in more than 570 restaurants and bars in Florida, and he asked Salzman to amend the bill to allow for on-premise consumption by adults 21 and over.
Rep. Salzman insisted that provision was important, citing the absence of any mechanism to test for intoxication by such products.
Second Amendment angle
A couple of hemp business officials tried a new argument —that it’s limitations on THC in hemp-infused products would compel military veterans to sign up as a medical marijuana patient in Florida.
That, they said, would violate their Second Amendment rights because federal law classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, causing complications for medical marijuana patients who want to own firearms. (Former Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried lost a federal lawsuit in 2022 challenging federal prohibitions on medical-marijuana patients buying and possessing guns).
J.J. McCormick, chairman of American Healthy Alternatives Association, described a conservation he had with a military veteran who uses hemp-derived THC products.
“He said as someone who held clearances and often had to be nimble in their employment, both stateside and overseas, he would never get a medical marijuana license because he would be forced to lie and perjure himself on background checks to obtain firearms and sign contracts,” he said.
“This is a one-two punch that displaces thousands of Florida families,” added Shai Ortiz, CEO of Siesta G, based in eastern Hillsborough County. “This stifles innovation. This stifles Florida-first values.”
The regulations passed unanimously in committee, however, and now go to the floor for a vote — where they will have to be reconciled with the Senate version to get to DeSantis desk this year.
“This is a common-sense bill built on collaboration,” Salzman said, resulting in a measure that is unified around a single goal: “protecting Floridians while preserving opportunities.”

Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, speaks with news reporters at the state Capitol after a meeting of the House Administrative Rules Committee, which he leads, on May 14. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Rather than punting the responsibility to the governor, a bill moving through the legislative process would require the Legislature to proactively approve changes to state agencies’ rules. 
Oklahoma’s current administrative rules process requires all submitted rules to be reviewed by the Legislature, but if lawmakers take no action, they are sent to the governor. If the governor also declines to act, the rules automatically go into effect.
Senate Bill 995, authored by Rep. Gerrid Kendrix, R-Altus, would require the Legislature to approve all rules through a joint resolution. Any that are not explicitly approved would be considered disapproved. 
Proactive approval used to be required for the Legislature, Kendrix said, but the process was changed over a decade ago. 
Usually a dry topic, administrative rules have the force of law and are designed to build upon the statutes legislators create. 
“Myself, as an elected legislator, if I run legislation and I can’t get it taken up on the floor, what happens to it? It dies,” he said. “But that’s not what happens with the rules. So we have granted a little more authority to unelected bureaucrats, agency directors. I don’t want to be mean, but we’ve allowed that more authority to them than to the elected legislator.”
The measure is an attempt to add more light and transparency to the process and to involve more people in conversations, he said. 
Last year, lawmakers faced criticism for refusing to vote on a controversial set of 20 rules proposed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. One of the more controversial rules tied a school’s state test scores to its accreditation. Lawmakers sent the rules to Gov. Kevin Stitt, who approved them all. 
Kendrix, who chairs the House Administrative Rules Committee, said the full Legislature hasn’t taken action on administrative rules since he was elected in 2020. He said this year there are over 5,000 pages of rule packets riddled with mistakes. 
“I’m trying to bring transparency to it, which in turn creates accountability,” Kendrix said. “It creates more structure and attention to the rules. I mean, we have rules coming in that have incomplete sentences, that have words that are misspelled, and being a (certified public accountant), I’m a detailed guy. And so if we have things like that that are happening, what else is happening?”
SB995 is a “piece of the puzzle” to bring more transparency since there has been increased interest from Republicans and Democrats on the issue in recent years, he said.
The legislation has had strong bipartisan support, he said. The bill unanimously cleared the state Senate and a House committee. It awaits a hearing before the full House.
Kendrix and Sen. Micheal Bergstrom, R-Adair, the Senate author, held an interim study in October to explore the idea for the measure. 
As a House committee made changes to the bill, the Senate will reconsider the amended version if it passes off the House floor.

Peter Welch, D-Vt., with Mohsen Mahdawi at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans on Monday, April 21. Photo courtesy of the office of Sen. WelchU.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., visited Mohsen Mahdawi in a Vermont jail Monday, sharing a snippet of their conversation to social media.And on Tuesday, more than 100 people rallied at the Statehouse to call for his release and what they characterized as the federal government’s circumvention of due process. “I’m staying positive by reassuring myself in the inevitability of justice and the deep belief of democracy. This is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country, because I believe in the principles of this country,” Mahdawi told Welch in a recorded conversation posted to social media. Mahdawi, a Palestinian student organizer at Columbia University who lives in the Upper Valley, was arrested by federal agents in Colchester last week during an interview for U.S. citizenship. Masked federal officers ushered Mahdawi into a vehicle, and he was later detained at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans. Lawyers for Mahdawi quickly filed a lawsuit arguing his detention was unlawful, and a federal judge in Vermont ordered that he not be taken from the state. A hearing in his case is scheduled for Wednesday morning. Following Mahdawi’s arrest, top state Senate Democrats called on Gov. Phil Scott to end the state’s agreement with federal immigration authorities, which allows the feds to detain people not charged with crimes in Vermont’s six prisons. In response, Scott said he’d consider ending or revising the contract, which is set to expire in August, but wanted to weigh what was in the “best interest” of people detained by federal immigration officials. Advocates have begrudgingly argued that at the moment, they would prefer detainees remain in Vermont rather than be transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in far away states. Ministers attend a press conference called to denounce last week’s detention of Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, April 22. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerTuesday, dozens of Mahdawi’s supporters flooded the Statehouse as part of a protest organized by Vermont Interfaith Action. In conjunction, Senate Democrats held a press conference alongside advocates and House colleagues, decrying overreach by ICE and highlighting legislation under development that would expand protections for immigrants. Sen. Nader Hashim, D-Windham, who serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said at the press conference that rather than litigating the state’s prison agreement with the feds, he was working on legislation that would restrict the types of immigration detainees who could be held in Vermont’s prisons. People detained by immigration authorities in Vermont should be held here rather than sent out of state, he said, but ICE has also been detaining a second category of people in Vermont.“The second group, these are the folks who are transported to Vermont after they’ve been detained in another district. These are the folks who were taken away from their family, friends and lawyers, people who were brought here so that their due process is disrupted,” Hashim said. “It’s my opinion that Vermont should not be complicit in supporting ICE’s human trafficking operation by allowing our state facilities to hold detainees who are arrested in other districts.”As of Tuesday, there were 25 people in Vermont’s prisons detained for federal immigration authorities, according to Vermont Department of Corrections data.Asked about Mahdawi’s detention in Vermont, Nick Deml, the state’s corrections commissioner, said in a statement that “many questions remain unanswered” about the Vermont resident’s detention by immigration authorities, which he called an “uncertain situation.” He added that the Department of Corrections was “best positioned to ensure respect for (Mahdawi’s) due process rights, his access to attorneys of his choice and our federal courts.”The Vermont House adopted a resolution Tuesday “objecting to the manner and circumstances” of Mahdawi’s detention and calling for him to be “released immediately.” In Welch’s filmed conversation with Mahdawi, the Upper Valley resident assured those concerned about him that he is in “good hands” and shared a message to people watching. “I don’t want you to worry about me. I want you to continue working for the democracy of this country and for humanity,” he said.

Jared Polis will veto the policy, arguing that it erodes First Amendment rights to freedom of speech.
Senate Bill 25-86 passed both chambers of the Legislature with a widely bipartisan vote. But in a statement last week, Polis said he has concerns over the bill’s impact on “freedom, innovation, and privacy.” His office of information technology testified against the bill as it went through the legislative process.
The bill was sent to his office on April 14, and he has until Thursday to sign or veto it. If it is vetoed, the Legislature would have time to vote on an override, which would require two-thirds of the body in support.

Opponents of the bill primarily worry about having private companies, such as Meta and X, act as law enforcement over speech on the platforms.
“While we share the intent of keeping kids safe online, the reality is that when we begin to consciously erode the First Amendment rights of some, we start to erode the rights of all,” said Anaya Robinson, a policy strategist at ACLU Colorado, during a Tuesday press conference. The comments come after the bill’s sponsors and supporters held their own press conference to urge Polis’ signature.
Robinson referenced the 2017 U.S. Supreme Court case Packingham v. North Carolina, a decision that determined a North Carolina law banning registered sex offenders from accessing some social media sites was unconstitutional. A regulation on speech, justices decided, needs to be narrowly tailored and serve a significant government interest.










This bill actually gives tech companies more power and makes them an extension of law enforcement.


– Hazel Gibson, political director at ProgressNow Colorado


The Colorado bill concerns social media users who attempt to sell guns, drugs or sex traffic minors on the platform. Companies would be required to determine within 10 days of notification if the user violated their policy on the topic, and kick them off the platform within 24 hours if they decided a violation occurred. Additionally, companies would need to comply with search warrants from law enforcement within three days.
Sponsors and backers of the bill say it reflects the growing reality of how minors and young people access drugs and firearms today, as well as the danger of sexual exploitation on social media platforms.
Hazel Gibson, the political director at ProgressNow Colorado, a left-leaning advocacy organization, said the bill is an example of government overreach into a private company by mandating that they police speech.
“This bill actually gives tech companies more power and makes them an extension of law enforcement. I don’t think giving them more power is the solution to those problems,” she said. “We know that kids of color are already over-policed in real life, and now we’re expanding that into the digital world.”
Gibson and Robinson said they worry about the ripple effect of the bill to embolden other states to pass similar laws.

Ned Lamont toured a farm to celebrate Earth Day and a grant program that illustrated the reach and limits of spending cap constraints.,"The rows of hanging flower baskets stretched towards the back of an automated Kurtz Farms greenhouse in Cheshire that seemed to have no end. Beneath them sat colorful flats of impatiens, pansies, petunias and marigolds.
Watering booms pass over the flats, Bluetooth sensors directing how long a drink they require. Above, the baskets move on an automated line, briefly pausing at a device that weighs and waters them by need.
Gov. Ned Lamont toured the farm Tuesday to celebrate Earth Day and a one-shot Climate Smart Ag and Forestry grant program that illustrated the reach — and limits — of a state government constrained by spending caps.
With $7 million in available in carry-forward dollars that are outside the spending cap — money unspent in one fiscal year and carried over to the next — the state Department of Agriculture quickly fashioned a grant program aimed at helping the Connecticut farming industry become more sustainable.
“We’ve got over 5,000 farms in the state of Connecticut, 370,000 acres of land being worked, 30,000-plus employees that all generate $4 billion to the state’s economy,” said Bryan Hurlburt, the state commissioner of agriculture. “The greenhouse industry is the largest sector of Connecticut’s agricultural economy.”
The Climate Smart grants went directly to some recipients. Others went to organizations like the Connecticut Greenhouse Growers Association, which evaluated applications and made awards. The greenhouse growers had at least $1.7 million to award.
It’s a one-shot program. No funding for another round of grant is in the budget Lamont  proposed in February or the revisions made Tuesday by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee.
Hurlburt noted that demand far outstripped the available dollars: About 70 applicants made proposals totaling $55 million, nearly eight times the appropriated dollars.
“Connecticut farmers want to participate in a climate-smart future. They want to be able to implement this technology,” he said. “They want to be able to make these investments. But it’s hard in a low-margin industry to be able to find the available capital to put in place these pieces of equipment or these investments.”
In most cases, the state grants leveraged investments from the farms, he said.
A $257,000 grant enabled Kurtz Farms to accelerate modernization, said Earl “E.J.” Kurtz, the third generation of siblings and cousins operating a wholesale nursery business founded in 1941 by their grandparents, Earl and Ruth Kurtz. The family grows plants in 25 acres of covered greenhouses.
Cheshire long has been a center of growing bedding plants, supplying retail nurseries across Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and beyond. Kurtz farms has a catalog offering 10,000 varieties, including vegetables and tropical plants in a year-round operation.
Kurtz said the family already had invested in automation that watered plants on timers and opened greenhouse louvers, allowing greater circulation based on inputs from an on-site weather station that measurers sunlight, temperature and humidity. The grant allowed the installation of a computerized system that precisely measures and applies water, fertilization and fungicides.
He led Lamont on a tour of a greenhouse where 26,000 hanging flower baskets were growing, watered and fed by the new system.
“I love your office,” Lamont said. “So beautiful. It’s amazing, and it brings to life for me what sustainable farming, sustainable agriculture? Words we throw around a lot.”
The operation is year-round, but the demand peaks once the weather breaks in spring and backyard gardeners buy bedding plants. They grow three or four crops — turnovers, in industry parlance — of the spring standards like the Delta Cotton Mix pansies that are almost sold out, Bonanza Orange marigolds or Blue Pearl impatiens.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7353-3-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

Brad Little issued an executive order Tuesday directing the Idaho Department of Lands to increase forest management activities on federal national forests in Idaho and reduce the risk of wildfire.
“(The Idaho Department of Lands) will work with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) wherever possible to utilize all federal and state authorities to expedite active forest management and mitigate the risk of catastrophic wildfires,” Little wrote in Executive Order 2005-04, which he called the Make Forests Healthy Again Act.

In a press release announcing the executive order, Little said his action complements the March 1 Freeing our Forests Act signed by President Donald Trump and a memo issued this month by United States Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins that aim to minimize wildfire risk and increase management of federal forests, Little said. 
  Idaho governor calls for timber harvests, prescribed burns, thinning to reduce wildfire risk 

Forest management activities included timber harvests, prescribed burns, mechanical thinning and an aggressive initial attack during the peak of wildfire season, Little said. 
In Tuesday’s press release, Little said that under the previous administration of President Joe Biden, the Idaho Department of Lands was limited to two small areas where it could help the federal government with expanded forest management activities.
Little said that has changed and expanded under the new Trump administration.

“For too long, millions of acres of national forests in Idaho have remained totally untouched, creating a tinderbox of fuel that threatens communities, air quality and the environment,” Little said in a written statement Tuesday. “The State of Idaho has led the country in standing up programs to help our federal partners increase the pace and scale of active management on federal ground. The work we’ve done is making a difference.”
In conjunction with Little’s press release, Idaho Farm Bureau CEO Zak Miller issued a statement praising Little and Trump’s actions.

“Farm Bureau strongly supports President Trump’s and Gov. Little’s emphasis on returning active management to federal lands in Idaho,” Miller wrote. “Our members have been personally devastated by the negative effects of reduced federal management over the years. We fully support Gov. Little’s executive order and look forward to cooperatively increasing the level of management of federal lands in Idaho so they will be as productive and healthy as our state lands.”
Rollins, the United States secretary of agriculture, also issued a statement released by Little’s office Tuesday saying the move will strengthen the timber industry.
“I commend Gov. Little for acting quickly to fix our national forest emergency,” Rollins wrote. “Americans rely on Idaho’s productive and abundant forests, and this executive order will go a long way towards strengthening the timber industry in the state and minimizing harmful pests, disease and risk of fire.”
Utah Gov. Spencer Cox issued a similar executive order on Monday to encourage wildfire preparedness across the Beehive State, according to the Utah News Dispatch. 
The order, according to Cox’s office, is meant to “improve coordination among state, local, and federal partners ahead of the 2025 fire season,” the news organization reported.

Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, urged his colleagues Tuesday in the Iowa Senate to voice their support for bringing up legislation for debate on carbon capture pipelines.
His statement prompted both Republicans and Democrats to blame the opposing party for why the Senate has not moved on the issue for several years.
Evans said on the Senate floor that lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, should voice their support for debating House File 639, the legislation passed by the House in March addressing several issues related to pipelines — or any bill related to the use of eminent domain in building carbon sequestration pipelines. He made his statement as part of a “point of personal privilege” after Senate debate ended Tuesday.
Evans said lawmakers have sworn an oath to the U.S. Constitution when they took office, and his colleagues have an obligation to publicly vote about the use of eminent domain in building private carbon capture pipelines, as the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution deals with the use of eminent domain in taking private property for public use.
“This is not only a constitutional issue,” Evans said. “It is simply the right thing to do for our property owners, as many of them who have an objection to the use of eminent domain are generational landowners. It means much more to them than just productivity. It’s part of their family, it’s part of their heritage, it’s part of their being.”
Eminent domain allows the government to force unwilling landowners to sell easements on their property for projects deemed to be a public benefit — often, projects like building roads or public utilities. The Iowa Utilities Commission has allowed the use of eminent domain for Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed carbon sequestration pipeline over the objections of landowners and others who argue the private project is not in the public’s interest.
The House bill is the most likely to come up for discussion and a public vote by the Senate, as it has passed the Senate Commerce Committee. The measure was amended by the Senate committee, led by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, to remove some portions of the House legislation while adding new components, like expanding the scope of the bill to cover other types of pipelines and allow pipeline projects to seek voluntary easements outside of the original project corridor.
Evans urged his colleagues to move on the bill because it is the first measure on pipelines to become eligible for floor debate in the Senate in several years.
Pipelines have been a high-profile issue at the Iowa Legislature for several years as the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project is going through the approval process. Landowners who own property in the path of the proposed carbon sequestration pipeline, which would span more than 1,000 miles in Iowa, have been frequent visitors to the State Capitol, meeting with lawmakers and protesting the lack of action to limit the use of eminent domain in building the pipeline.
House lawmakers have passed bills in several previous sessions with bipartisan support that have failed to gain traction in the Senate. Evans called for lawmakers to speak with Senate Majority Whip Mike Klimesh to share their stance on the bill, “because we need to know how many people are in support of this.”
“We better all be in support of it, every one of us, doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or Democrat — we took an oath to support the U.S. Constitution,” Evans said. “Let Sen. Klimesh know where you stand on this. He’s probably going to ask you the question, as he should, ‘What bill do you want to see move forward,’ and ‘How do you want to see it move?’ Look him in the eye and say, ‘I don’t care. Let’s get something to the floor, and let’s vote on it,’ and let’s protect the rights of our property owners in this state.”
Sen. Zach Wahls,  a Coralville Democrat, said Republicans, including Evans, voted against a Senate rule change to allow “discharge petitions” — an alternate way to bring certain bills to a vote in the Senate. Discharge petitions are used when the chair of a committee chooses not to place a certain bill on the committee’s agenda, removing it from consideration and not allowing a vote to take place.
Wahls indicated allowing this process to happen could have brought pipeline bills to a vote in the Senate. Still, Wahls added that he hoped Evans was being “earnest” when calling for lawmakers to talk to leadership about the amended legislation currently available for debate in the chamber.
“I hope that maybe this signals a willingness on the part of the majority to work with Democrats when it comes to passing legislation that’s good for Iowa,” Wahls said.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, also jumped into the discussion, asking Wahls if the Iowa Democratic Party has “made an official statement on their stance on the pipeline.” While Democrats have not made a statement as a party about their position on the pipeline, Wahls said Green was portraying the issue of eminent domain as partisan.
“You want to say, ‘Well, Democrats believe this, or all Democrats believe that,’ the same way that you want to say, ‘All Republicans believe this, or all Republicans believe that,’ and try to make this a partisan thing — when we all know that if that bill was on the floor, there’d be 26 votes for it,” Wahls said.
Green said Democrats “enjoy theatrics, the cameras, all that stuff” in bringing up amendments to legislation that he said were not discussed with Republican leaders, and he believed members of the minority party should be having “those serious conversations with a few handful of Republicans before you do that.”
He said Republicans were having private conversations about the legislation.
“We as Republicans, are having a serious conversation within our caucus, and I appreciate all Republicans that have engaged in that conversation,” Green said. “I’m sorry we’re not theatrical about it. I’m sorry we don’t make public spectacles about it. But in this chamber, I commend everybody that has been a part of this conversation. And I do hope that as the session wraps up, that we will come to an agreement.”
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, said Democrats have “been sitting here for years” asking for the majority party to bring the issue to a vote in the Senate. Bisignano said the Senate majority leader and Senate president have the ability to bring the bill to the floor at any time, and called for the Republican leaders to bring the bill up for debate Tuesday.
“Let’s frame this the way it is: it’s a property rights bill of taking people’s property for the private sector,” Bisignano said. “… I’d be more than happy to take that vote this afternoon. Madam President, Mr. Majority Leader, bring the bill up, and let’s debate it, and let’s vote.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Iowa-Senate-1.13.25-_-Kathie-Obradovich-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)Four years ago, a young woman, Chloe Worl, was killed shortly before 8 a.m. outside of Dillon by a distracted driver.
The other driver, texting on her phone and using Snapchat, slammed Worl’s pickup at 60 mph. Worl, who was 25 and working at Barrett Hospital at the time, was killed instantly. 
The driver who killed Worl avoided jail time for the death. 
Montana does not have laws making distracted driving illegal, something some lawmakers this session sought to change with Senate Bill 359.
Some municipalities, like Helena and Billings, already have distracted driving laws. Signs dot the towns, reminding motorists to look up at the road, not down at their phones.
But efforts to bring distracted driving laws statewide have stalled.
“She was an amazing young lady whose life was cut too short, but she’s one of many,” said Sen. Sara Novak, an Anaconda Democrat who pushed distracted driving legislation this session. “This keeps happening.”
There were 203 traffic fatalities in 2024, according to the Montana Department of Transportation. That number was less than 200 in 2023. Many of the fatal crashes have been clustered in the southwestern portion of the state.
Nationally, fatalities are more common in rural areas than urban, and more than 3,200 people died in crashes caused by distracted driving in 2023.
Worl held a degree from the University of Montana Western in molecular biology and had planned to attend the University of Montana’s pharmacy school. She was a hunter, an avid horseback rider, a National Honors Society member and musically gifted.
Her death shocked not only the Dillon community, but north in Anaconda as well. Worl was a Copperhead, a graduate of Anaconda High School and a four-year softball player.
Worl’s memory still lives — her family has spoken in favor of legislation seeking to penalize distracted driving and there’s even an annual scholarship in her name.
“We’ve learned a lot since this tragedy has happened to us,” Keith Worl, Chloe’s father, said during a Senate Transportation hearing for SB 359 in late February. “I guess it’s also fueled our fire to not have this tragedy happen to anybody else we know.”
Chloe Worl’s memory lives in Novak’s mind too. Novak’s Senate Bill 359 would have added penalties for distracted driving.
While the session is not over quite yet, the effort has stalled. The legislation passed the Senate, but was tabled in the House Judiciary Committee.
Two attempts to blast SB 359, both by legislators from nearby districts, failed during the last two weeks. The first motion to move it to the House floor, by Rep. Jennifer Lynch, a Butte Democrat, failed by one vote with one member, a Democrat, voting remotely.
Blast motions can only be voted on by members who are present in the chamber at the time of the vote, and if they would have had that vote on the first motion to reconsider, the legislation likely would have seen the House floor. Rep. Scott DeMarois, a Democrat from Anaconda, brought the second blast motion to move the bill to the floor. It failed by four votes.
“For whatever reason, the stars didn’t align,” Novak said. “It’s emotional, it’s frustrating.”
Novak was Worl’s driving instructor, teaching her siblings as well. She was carrying SB 359 for the family and said last week it was her most important piece of legislation this session.
“She was a ray of sunshine,” Novak said.
It frustrated Novak, who felt “politics” played a part in the bill’s struggles, but for her the bill not going cuts even deeper.
Law enforcement and the state Department of Transportation supported the bill in its committee hearings, but trouble began in the Senate. Asking municipal courts to prosecute the charges was one issue.
There was a sense by some legislators it was an attempt by the transportation department to increase revenue by adding penalties.
“I do value life, but this bill usually goes through judiciary,” Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, said March 2 on the Senate floor. “But it seems to me, based on the discussion, that this is about money, because this was pushed, I guess, by the Department of Transportation, because we’re losing money.”
Comments on her intent were also lambasted by Sen. Pat Flowers, D-Belgrade, as a point of decorum during Senate floor discussion. Novak recently said the MDT trying to get more funding wasn’t the driver of the bill and made a similar comment on the floor in March.
“In terms of the attacks on MDT and my reasons for bringing this bill, I take exception to that,” Novak said on March 2. “As this bill sponsor, I did a lot of homework, and I reached out to who I thought would be of interest in this bill.”
Novak said there was some conversation about amending the bill to specifically ban texting. But this doesn’t go far enough, she said.
“It’s more than just texting,” Novak said.
A car can travel the length of a football field while glancing at a phone for five seconds at 55 mph. Other messaging apps like Snapchat can be a pull, as can social media, taking photos and changing a song.
There has been some appetite in the Legislature to regulate motorists this session, and Bobby’s Law, House Bill 267, would create a mandatory minimum for some fatal DUIs in the state.
Novak’s bill would have made it a $75 ticket on first offense for distracted driving and $150 for subsequent infractions.
The intention of Novak’s legislation wasn’t fully punitive, she said. It’s more of creating reminders, so that fewer families will be shattered by a preventable crash, she added.
“We weren’t trying to hammer anything with a bunch of heavy fines or create more work for law enforcement,” Novak said in an interview. “It was more educational and being a deterrent.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Texting-driving-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) The League of Women Voters of North Dakota is asking Gov. Kelly Armstrong to veto a bill that would shorten the window for North Dakotans to submit mail-in absentee ballots.
Mail-in ballots are counted in North Dakota so long as they’re postmarked by the day before Election Day and are delivered within 13 days of the election. 
House Bill 1165 would amend this to require mail-in ballots to be received by an election officer by the time the polls close — a change the League in a Tuesday email to members called an “overreach and overreaction.”
“Eligible North Dakota voters should be able to mail their absentee ballot without fear that their ballot will be tossed out,” Barbara Headrick, the organization’s president, said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. She said the bill would create obstacles for groups like rural and Native voters, seniors and people with disabilities.
The amendment was made to comply with a March 25 executive order issued by President Donald Trump that forbids states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.
North Dakota counties report absentee ballots with missing postmarks

The bill was originally intended to clean up state law governing elections procedures. The main purpose of the bill is to make ballots easier for voters to understand and make election practices more uniform across the state. It addresses things like write-in candidate deadlines, what counts as a valid residential address and who can remove election judges, for example.
“What’s in this bill is what I would refer to as the ‘no-brainer’ stuff,” Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, the bill’s primary sponsor, said at its first hearing before the House Political Subdivisions Committee in January.
The Senate State and Local Government Committee during committee discussion earlier this month added the deadline change for mail-in ballots. The amendment was brought by the Secretary of State’s Office, according to Deputy Secretary of State Sandra McMerty.
McMerty in a Tuesday statement to the North Dakota Monitor said the change was suggested to comply with the executive order and to “remove uncertainty and inconsistencies surrounding postmarking requirements of the USPS.” 
Since the amendment was introduced after the bill’s public hearing in the Senate, the public did not have an opportunity to comment on the proposed changes.
States neighboring North Dakota — Minnesota, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska — already have similar requirements on the books, she noted.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, chair of the Senate State and Local Government Committee, said during the hearing the Legislature had weighed adopting the policy before and that she feels it is “best practice” for elections. 
The state has been reluctant to change the law in case ballot delivery is delayed by the postal service, Roers said. She said this shouldn’t be an issue since the post office treats the election-related mail with extra care.
McMerty said the Secretary of State’s Office doesn’t anticipate the change causing any problems either.
“We don’t foresee significant barriers to voters as 0.1% of absentee ballots in the general election were postmarked prior to Election Day and delivered to the county after Election Day,” she told the Monitor.
Military overseas ballots wouldn’t have to observe the same deadline, they would just have to be mailed by the time polls close on Election Day, the bill indicates. Ballots would have to be received by the time the county canvassing board meets. Voters also would be able to personally hand in their ballots to their county auditor on Election Day before polls close. 
Voting by mail? Election workers are worried about issues at the Postal Service.

The Senate last week voted 43-4 to pass the bill. The House on Monday approved the amended bill by a vote of 85-7.
The Legislature in March approved a resolution earlier this session, House Concurrent Resolution 3006, calling on the postmaster general of the United States Postal Service to address problems with mail. 
“During testimony, we heard instance after instance of non-delivered or late delivered mail that caused harm to our citizens,” said Sen. Mike Wobemma, R-Valley City, said of the measure on the Senate floor last month.
After last June’s primary election, at least five North Dakota counties reported receiving absentee ballots by mail with no postmarks.
Trump’s executive order remains in effect, though a group of 19 states earlier this month filed a federal lawsuit over the directive, arguing that it violates states rights and will make it harder for some Americans to vote. North Dakota is not a party to the lawsuit.

Amid a national maelstrom of attacks on academic freedom, the fate of James Bowley, the former chair and professor of Religious Studies at Millsaps College, hinges on a 10-word email he sent to his class of three students the morning after the presidential election. Nearly a month after a grievance committee repudiated his subsequent termination over those 10 words, his status remains in flux.
The day following his email, Bowley found out that he had been placed on paid administrative leave pending a review of his use of a Millsaps email account “to share personal opinions” with his students. 
Around the days of the election, racist messages targeting African American students had been sent using the anonymous campus messaging platform Yik Yak. The FBI had informed the Millsaps community via email that it, along with law enforcement and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was investigating those messages. 
“I personally would not send that kind of content to my class. But I understand the disappointment behind the email, understand the human sympathy, especially what happened with the Yik Yak post,” said David Wood, chair of the Modern Languages department at Millsaps College, referring to racist and threatening messages directed at African American students on the anonymous messaging platform Yik Yak, around the days of the 2024 presidential election. 
“I knew the students were fearful. So I canceled my class,” Bowley said. “And I do not regret that for a second.” His 10-word email explained why the class was being cancelled: “to mourn and process this racist fascist country.”
Bowley filed a grievance against his leave of absence with the university’s grievance committee, which could not identify any specific policy that he had violated. It recommended in December that Bowley be reinstated immediately; that the Interim provost issue a formal apology to him, and that he be compensated for a loss of income that arose from his removal from a study abroad course he was supposed to have taught.
Weeks later, Bowley’s employment was terminated, by the interim provost — a decision he appealed. The interim provost at the time, Stephanie Rolph, was a candidate for the full-time position. 
Now, nearly a month after the grievance committee decided to allow the terms of Bowley’s reinstatement be negotiated, his employment remains in flux as he waits for Millsaps’ president to affirm or overrule their decision. 
The purpose of the college’s action “is to demonstrate the power of the administration over the faculty,” Bowley said. “I think the whole point is to make faculty self censor.”
The termination of Bowley comes amid a nationwide crackdown by universities and the Trump administration on speech by students and faculty. Since 2023, dozens of faculty members have been disciplined, or even fired. Since March, more than 1,500 international students have seen their visas revoked, with some even being detained without due process. And top universities have seen threats of funding freezes if they do not agree to laundry lists of demands and restrictions. 
On Monday, Harvard University, which has vowed not to “surrender its independence or constitutional rights,” sued the Trump administration in an attempt to block them from freezing $2.2 billion in federal funding and an additional $1 billion in grants, which the administration in a letter had said it would do if the university did not overhaul its admissions and hiring policies, among others, allow for federal oversight of its operations, and commission external audits of a number of departments. 
This letter, which the Trump administration now says was sent in error, came about a month after Columbia University capitulated to similar demands by the administration – in its case, which included empowering campus security to make arrests, suspending students involved in protests last spring, and placing its department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies under administrative receivership. 
On Tuesday, the American Association of Colleges and Universities, which has more than 800 member institutions, issued a public statement, condemning “undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses” and “coercive use of public research funding.” 
Nearly 200 leaders of educational institutions signed the statement, including Millsaps College – the only Mississippi institution to do so. The president of Columbia University did not.

“Millsaps promises free speech to its faculty members and when it makes a promise like that it should stand by that promise and protect it,” said Haley Gluhanich, senior program counsel of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. In Bowley’s case, she said, “We saw these violations of fundamental due process rights – the fact that he was put on administrative leave before he even had a hearing.”
Millsaps’ Faculty Handbook says a faculty member is “entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing the subject matter of the course, but should be careful not to introduce controversial matter which has no relation to the subject.” It elaborates that “when speaking or writing as a citizen, the teacher is free from institutional censorship or discipline, but this special position in the community imposes special obligations,” because the public may interpret the words of a faculty member as being representative of the position of the institution. 
However, in the grievance committee’s December recommendation, it found that the handbook “does not offer guidance on how to distinguish personnel matters from matters of academic freedom,” and that this lack of clarity appeared to expose tenured faculty members to a disciplinary process that was subject to the sole decision of any acting provost, with no recourse. 
“When they are sharing a personal opinion, a criticism of an election,” said Gluhanich, “no reasonable person is going to assume that that is the speech of the college.” 
“Millsaps truly shaped me. It broke down the conceptions that I had of the world and religion and philosophy and ideas. By doing so it forced me to build them back up,” said Elizabeth Land, an alumna of Millsaps College. “I was taught to think for myself. And that’s a gift that you can’t put a price tag on.”
Land circulated a petition last December calling for Bowley’s reinstatement – a decision that in April, has yet to be made. 
Joey Lee, director of communications at Millsaps College said, on behalf of the office of the president, that they could not comment on ongoing personnel issues.

Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, speaks during House debate in March 2025 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Legislation that would void non-disclosure agreements in child sexual abuse cases received unanimous approval from Missouri’s House on Tuesday afternoon.
The bill, sponsored by Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz from Branson, now heads to the Missouri Senate.
Non-disclosure agreements are “legal mechanisms that were created to protect trade secrets, not trauma secrets,” Seitz said last week during House debate.
“We must clarify the law on use of the NDAs in civil child sexual abuse settlements, so that survivors of such horrors who already feel shamed and silenced are also not legally silenced and intimidated,” Seitz said.
Seitz called NDAs “an injustice and a wrong that we can make right now.” 
The legislation applies to any legal action starting Aug. 28 of this year, when the law would take effect. It makes NDAs in childhood sexual abuse cases unenforceable. 
Seitz said while the bill “cannot fix the horrific events leading up to signing an NDA, it can prevent the silencing of child crime victims in the future, and would certainly make Missouri safer for all.” 
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, said Tuesday: “We should not be protecting the business interests of perverts, of people who hurt children.”
The bill has been called “Trey’s Law,” referring to the late Trey Carlock, who died by suicide in 2019 after being sexually abused by Pete Newman at the Branson-based Kanakuk Kamps.
Trey’s sister, Elizabeth Carlock, said at a hearing on the bill in February that he had to agree to an NDA as a condition of his settlement with the camp.
“Trey told someone just before his death that they’ll always control me and I’ll never be free,” Carlock said in February, “…A lot of truth dies with people because of NDAs, and that only protects bad actors, which is contrary to public interest.” 
Texas is also aiming to ban NDAs in child sexual abuse cases this session. Tennessee enacted similar legislation in 2018. 
“Silence actually kills, as my family knows,” Carlock told lawmakers. “It endangers the public. This practice is nothing short of evil, and it only protects darkness.” 
Kanakuk director Pete Newman pleaded guilty in 2010 to seven counts of sexual abuse, and the prosecutor said Newman’s victim count might be in the hundreds. Newman is currently serving two life sentences plus 30 years in prison. 
Kanakuk leadership maintains that they had no advanced knowledge of his behavior, and Newman was a “master of deception.”
Keith Dygert, who was also abused by Newman, reached a settlement with a non-disclosure agreement, he testified in February. But only after signing it did he learn more from news articles about the extent of Newman’s abuse and Kanakuk’s potential knowledge, he said. 
Dygert said NDAs have “undeniably prevented proper and timely healing…by silencing victims when sharing their stories in their own time, in their own way.”
He said it was worth his taking the risk of breaking his NDA to speak out.
“When victims are silenced, the truth is also silenced, and the institutions that helped enable child sexual abuse are protected,” Dygert said. 
No one testified in opposition.
State Rep. Rudy Veit, a Republican from Wardsville, said in February’s hearing: “I believe that NDAs serve a very useful purpose in some situations, but in this situation, I can see that there’s really no advantage other than to the perpetrator.”
Similar legislation in the Missouri Senate passed out of committee earlier this month but hasn’t been debated by the full chamber. No one testified in opposition in the Senate hearing, and only state Sen. Steve Roberts, a Democrat from St. Louis, voted against the measure. 
Seitz is also pushing legislation to extend the statute of limitations for survivors of childhood sex abuse. That legislation, attached to a broader bill about statutes of limitations, passed out of the House in February and Senate committee this month. It is awaiting consideration by the full Senate.

(Photo by Eddie Moore / Albuquerque Journal)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham pocket vetoed a bill introduced this session to establish Native cultural schools through a pilot program, the second time such a bill failed to make it through a recent session.
Sen. Benny Shendo Jr. (D-Jemez Pueblo) originally introduced the State-Tribal Education Compact Schools Act in 2023 to allow pueblos, tribes and nations to enter into compacts with the New Mexico Public Education Department and establish Native language and cultural schools. The 2023 bill died in committee, but this year, Senate Bill 13 found a lot of support.
SB13 was amended to limit the compacts to five schools under five-year pilot programs. It passed unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but Lujan Grisham failed to act on it by the April 11 deadline.
“The governor supports innovative approaches to Indigenous education; however, there were concerns about the bill exempting compact schools from accountability requirements without adequate implementation structure,” a spokesperson for the governor’s office told Source NM in an email. “The governor has directed PED to work closely with tribal governments, including Jemez Pueblo, to develop solutions that honor tribal sovereignty while ensuring quality education for all New Mexico students.”
The bill would have made state-tribal compact schools exempt from state statutes and rules pertaining to curriculum and school evaluation requirements and would instead have required the schools to rely on the terms of the compact as determined between the petitioning tribe, nation or pueblo and the PED.
Shendo told Source NM that he was disappointed with the outcome, but said he was notified the pocket veto might occur. He added that he thought the concern was over the compact schools receiving state funds based on the public school funding formula — the method of calculating how much money each public school district receives based on how many students they have, the needs of the students and other factors.
“Our schools are going to be very small because we only have so many tribes,” Shendo told Source.
He said he plans to work with the governor’s office and the PED during the interim to streamline the language in the bill and address concerns so it might be one of the governor’s priorities for the 2026 30-day legislative session.
“Us as Indian tribes, we’re not going anywhere. We can wait another year, we’ve been here a long time,” Shendo said. “We’re in it for the longhaul.”

Ron Sorvaag, R-Fargo, and Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota senators on Tuesday narrowly rejected a proposal to add $1 million for a “life education committee” in the Office of Management and Budget budget to teach people about abortion alternatives.
The amendment was brought by Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, who pitched the program as a way to help pregnant women.
The committee established by the amendment would have administered a campaign to teach the public about state abortion laws, policies “supporting life and family values,” and resources available for pregnant mothers, families and children. The campaign would have been carried out by a third party contractor.
The amendment was added by the Senate Appropriations Committee, but split from the rest of the budget bill so the Senate could vote on it separately.
North Dakota lawmakers look to add $1 million to state budget for anti-abortion campaign

Sen. David Clemens, who made the motion to split the bill, said he is not opposed to the idea of the program but takes issue with the fact that the proposal was never heard by a policy committee.
“I feel this is in violation of our own rules,” he said. Clemens, R-West Fargo, noted that members of the public were not provided the opportunity to speak for or against the funding.
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Williston Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he agreed with Clemens that the public did not get proper notice about the amendment.
“Had this been a standalone bill with its own title and its own placement into a policy committee, it would have had people interested in listening to the discussion,” he said.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, said the $1 million would be put to better use for guardianship grants. The request for the budget was about $9 million, but the OMB budget as currently written sets aside $8 million for the program, she said.
Myrdal said a procedural technicality should not stand in the way of something that will help women and children. She also pointed out that the committees routinely amend bills after their public hearings.
“Nothing was hidden, nothing was strange about it,” Myrdal said. 
The North Dakota Supreme Court in 2023 warned the Legislature against lumping issues into budget bills when it found that the state’s previous OMB budget violated the state constitution’s single-subject rule.
The amendment failed by a 23-24 vote.
Prairie Public supporters urge North Dakota Senate to restore state funding

The Senate approved other changes to the OMB budget, which included grant funding for Prairie Public.
The House had stripped Prairie Public’s $1.2 million base funding after it passed House Bill 1255, which sought to bar the state from spending state money to support public broadcasting. House Bill 1255 was subsequently defeated in the Senate.
The Senate Appropriations Committee added $850,000 to Prairie Public’s budget for broadcast tower infrastructure, but did not restore its $1.2 million base funding.
The Senate also reduced funding for a proposed state hospital in Jamestown by $45 million.
The amended funding includes $200 million from the strategic investment and improvements fund and $85 million from a Bank of North Dakota line of credit, for a total of $285 million. The funding was shifted to the OMB budget because that agency will oversee the construction.
The House’s version of the budget included $330 million for the hospital in the state’s Department of Health and Human Services budget. 
The budget also includes $2.3 million for new driveway and additional fencing for the governor’s residence.
The Office of Management and Budget bill will next go back to the House for a concurrence vote.

The potential gas tax increase, the first in the state since 2016, raises nearly half of the estimated $3.2 billion the new package is expected to bring in over six years. It would up the state’s levy from 49.4 cents per gallon to 55.4 cents, then lift it by 2% each year. 
The proposal is the product of bipartisan negotiations between legislators in the House and Senate seeking a solution to soaring project costs and flagging gas tax collections as drivers transition to more efficient vehicles. 
“We’re close,” said House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma.
The new proposition in Senate Bill 5801 makes a sizable dent in what’s estimated to be a $1 billion shortfall over the next two years and $8 billion over the next six years. Lawmakers say more money is needed to fund highway megaprojects, the Washington State Patrol, state ferries and the removal of culverts and other barriers blocking fish migration. 
Meanwhile, the two chambers are negotiating over what the new revenue will pay for as they hash out a two-year transportation plan in the $15 billion to $16 billion range.
Initial revenue packages released last month totaled $4.4 billion in the House and $3 billion in the Senate. 
The revised gas tax proposal hews closer to what the Senate previously unveiled. The House had teased raising the tax 9 cents, then indexing it to inflation. 
The Senate’s original plan received some Republican backing, passing 31-18 in March with three Democrats opposed and four Republicans in support.
Washington’s gas tax is already one of the highest in the country, before accounting for the 18.4-cent federal rate.
On top of the gas tax hike, the latest framework includes hikes for the diesel fuel tax — 3 cents a gallon in both fiscal years 2026 and 2028, then those increases indexed to rise 2% annually for inflation.  
There are also added taxes on vehicle sales, rental cars, luxury vehicles, private jets and a $1 per attendee fee on operators of stadiums and other venues with a capacity of 17,000 or more. 
One of the bigger-ticket items is $317 million from a $30-per-ton weight fee on heavy-duty trucks that would also rise with inflation in future years. Lawmakers also pencil in $138 million from violations of the state’s new speed cameras in work zones.
The tax cornucopia also drops some controversial ideas in the earlier House and Senate proposals. 
There’s no increased fee on electric vehicle registrations. There’s no new 10% surcharge on e-bike purchases. There’s no vehicle registration fee for transit operators. And there’s no ferry fare increase.
Most notable may be the absence of a new highway use fee the House had floated. 
The creative fee, patterned after a similar approach in Virginia, would have charged drivers based on their car’s fuel economy, with more efficient vehicles paying more. Fey and other Democrats have toyed with such a road usage charge for over a decade. He was disappointed to see it not included in Tuesday’s revenue proposal.
Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said negotiators dropped the charge because of how late in the process it came and the resulting lack of time “to understand the impacts.”
The plan includes other policy changes, including tolling on the entire State Route 520 corridor, not just the floating bridge, mandating biodiesel fuel for state ferries and providing a sales tax exemption for zero-emission buses. 
But it doesn’t include added uses for Tacoma Narrows Bridge toll proceeds or increased enforcement for expired vehicle registration tabs, as the Senate had proposed.
The proposal, heard in the House Transportation Committee on Tuesday, is set for a vote from the panel Wednesday morning.
The legislative session is scheduled to end Sunday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1232851427-scaled-1-e1687381640866-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida State University students, joined by House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, are calling for policy change following a campus shooting within walking distance of the chambers where laws are made.
A group of students gathered at the Capitol Tuesday only days after they barricaded themselves in classrooms Thursday when a shooter opened fire on campus, killing two and wounding six. 
“As a leader, I carry the weight of this moment and turn it into purpose. We owe it to the victims, not just here at Florida State University, but across Florida and across our nation to make sure that this doesn’t happen again,” said Andres Perez, president of the FSU chapter of Students Demand Action. 
The suspected gunman, step-son of a Leon County sheriff’s deputy, according to law enforcement, used her retired service weapon. Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said it was not surprising 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner would have access to weapons. He was involved with LCSO, including training with the department and sitting on a youth board advising the sheriff.

Madalyn Propst, president of FSU College Democrats, called on FSU to put locks on classroom doors, train professors to respond to shootings, and increase financial support for mental health intervention and advocacy. She said the shooting “was both senseless and preventable.”
“Although it is not a political issue when a mass tragedy happens, it becomes political when it is enabled by poor policy,” Propst said in the Captiol rotunda. 
“Because of a lack of proactive planning and poor policy on the hands of our legislators, there are two people who are dead who shouldn’t be, six people in the hospital who shouldn’t be, thousands of students who no longer feel safe on campus, and a community that is still reeling from a senseless act of violence, and no amount of thoughts and prayers is going to fix that.”
Propst called on Congress to reinstate the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, and on the Legislature to expand safe storage laws to apply to any house that someone who cannot legally handle a gun lives in.
“Shooting after shooting, we’re told to wait, and all we hear are ‘thoughts and prayers.’ And I’m sensitive to not politicizing an issue but, year after year, we file good, common sense bills to help make our community safer and, unfortunately, they don’t even get a committee hearing,” Driskell said. 
A Senate bill, SB 814, allowing students to carry guns on Florida campuses, lost steam earlier this session, and eyes are on the same chamber to see if it will pick up the House-approved bill, HB 759, to lower the age to buy long guns to 18.

‘Disgusted’
“I’m disgusted with my Legislature and the people that I know some of my friends and my family voted for,” Propst said. “The fact that they are able to sit in this place and prioritize weapons over my life, my friends’ lives, and the lives of my community around me is deplorable.”
The House bill would reverse in part a 2018 package addressing school safety passed just weeks after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. A response as quick as happened in 2018 does not seem so certain this year. 
“I think the only difference [between 2018 and now] is that it seems like the governor is desensitized to this. I mean, we saw the comments from President Trump, that, to me, was such a slap in the face to these students and to everyone in this community who’s been impacted by this gun violence,” Driskell.
Gov. Ron DeSantis released a video to X the day of the shooting and ordered flags flown at half-staff. President Donald Trump said, “I will always protect the Second Amendment,” and, “These things are terrible. But the gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do,” CBS News reported.
According to FSU, following the shooting it offered mental health assistance to more than 1,300 students Thursday through Sunday, including 604 on the day of the shooting and 520 on Sunday. The university continues to provide services through this week.  
The school canceled classes on Friday and resumed classes Monday with optional attendance. The semester ends May 2.
Rep. Christine Hunchofsky, mayor of Parkland during the 2018 shooting, reflected on the FSU shooting during a media availability Monday.
“If you haven’t been through something like this, it’s very hard to understand the level of trauma that people who have been through this are experiencing and, if that doesn’t get addressed early enough, it’s something that can become debilitating in the long term. And so, it’s so important to make sure that everyone has what they need,” Hunchofsky said.
Minutes after the shooting on Thursday, Hunchofsky presented HB 1403 to the House Education and Employment Committee, a bill that would address school safety measures. It passed unanimously.

Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, DFL-Minneapolis, denied to the ethics committee Tuesday that he did anything wrong when he spearheaded $3 million in state grants to a nonprofit run by a legal client, north Minneapolis Rev. Jerry McAfee.
Champion reiterated that his legal work for McAfee was pro-bono and concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session. Champion never disclosed his relationship with McAfee, which the Reformer first reported earlier this month. Because the work was pro-bono, he said didn’t need to tell his fellow senators about it when he authored a bill granting $3 million in public funds to McAfee’s violence prevention group 21 Days of Peace.
Following the Reformer’s first report on April 4, Champion asked the Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct to issue an advisory opinion on whether his actions represented a conflict of interest that should have been disclosed to the Senate. The committee held its first hearing in the matter on Tuesday and is scheduled to continue deliberating Thursday. Champion previously served as the chair of the ethics committee, but he stepped down following the Reformer report.
Senate Republicans have also filed an ethics complaint against Champion.
In a committee room Tuesday full of Black community leaders and Champion supporters — including McAfee — the Senate president said he represented McAfee pro-bono because he has deep connections to the north Minneapolis community. Champion and his family go to McAfee’s church, and Champion said wanted to give back to the community that raised him.
“I did nothing wrong then, and I did nothing wrong now,” Champion said.

Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)
McAfee, when first contacted by the Reformer, refused to say whether he’d paid Champion for the legal work, but he has since told other media and the Senate ethics committee that it was indeed pro-bono representation.
Beginning in 2022, Champion represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties. Champion detailed for the committee how the case ended in December 2022, but the order to dismiss the case wasn’t issued by opposing counsel until February 2023. His involvement with the case was over by that time, Champion testified.
Last month, Champion introduced a bill to provide an additional $1 million to 21 Days of Peace, but it didn’t make it into the Senate jobs bill. It could be included in a bill as the session continues, however.
Under Minnesota law, legislative conflicts of interest are narrowly defined and only exist when the official does something to benefit themselves financially. Minnesota’s part-time Legislature creates many opportunities for conflicts of interest, as most lawmakers have another job.
Outside ethics experts have said that Minnesota’s conflict of interest laws are among the weakest in the nation. A 2015 Center for Public Integrity report found that Minnesota ranked 44th in the nation on legislative accountability.
Champion, a practicing defense attorney, was also represented Tuesday by attorney David Zoll, who recently represented Rep. Brad Tabke, DFL-Shakopee, in an election contest case late last year.
The Senate president testified that he’s open to changing Minnesota’s ethics laws to ensure accountability for lawmakers in various professions.
“Right now — when you think in terms of lawyers — you can track lawyers, but we don’t track accountants and insurance brokers or real estate agents,” Champion said.
After the committee hearing, Champion told the Reformer in an interview that previous reporting about his connection with McAfee falsely jumps to the conclusion that he has a conflict of interest.
“If you look at the language of the law, it clearly says the official has to have a financial interest. When there’s a deviation from doing that and then immediately going to titles (headlines) like I ‘steered’ $3 million to a client, or ‘here are these other conflicts’ — you’re reaching a conclusion that there’s a conflict without even looking at the law,” Champion said.
Asked if he’s concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest, regardless of whether he violated Senate rules, Champion said he’s being unfairly singled out for common legislative behavior.
“My conduct is no different from anyone else’s conduct … but it feels like you’re making my situation bigger, wider, more corrupt, more fraud, than taking a very narrow but appropriate and balanced approach. If they want to change the conflict rules, change them.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250422_0180-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

Gov. Garlin Gilchrist pushes back on climate change denial while announcing grant funding for efforts aimed at meeting the state's healthy climate goals during the MI Healthy Climate Conference in Detroit on April 22, 2025. | Kyle Davidson Kicking off the third annual MI Healthy Climate conference, focused on advancing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s plan to reach 100% carbon neutrality by 2050, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist continued to call for climate action amid an uncertain federal landscape. 
While climate change denial may be at its peak within American culture, those committed to climate action must also be at the peak of their strength, Gilchrist said.
“Republicans at the federal and the state level are attacking climate action. They are committing to rolling back investments that have been made, that have been committed, that have been promised to people and communities here in the state of Michigan, to the tune of putting $14 billion of investment at risk that will raise energy prices on Michiganders,” said Gilchrist, who is a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026. 
However these threats emphasize the importance of climate efforts at the state and community level, Gilchrist said. 
Pulling from his past as a basketball player, Gilchrist said that sometimes the best defense is a good offense, framing the fight against climate change as an opportunity for change, growth, innovation and leadership. 
As Michigan leads the nation in clean energy job growth, and more clean energy adjacent businesses are growing in the state than ever before, Gilchrist pointed to these changes as an opportunity for Michigan to do more. 
As part of that effort Gilchrist announced the MI Healthy Climate Challenge, offering several millions of dollars in grants to projects that will help the state meet its goal of carbon neutrality. 
The program will include multiple competitions through 2026, with the first competition, Solar for Savings, offering $8.875 million in grants for residential and community solar pilot projects and upgrades to equipment and energy storage. The challenge is open and will accept entries through 5 p.m. on July 30, 2025. Applications are available at Michigan.gov/MHCChallenge.
Pilot programs supported by the competition are intended to lower energy costs, improve resiliency against power outages and create the groundwork for the MI Solar For All program, a $156 million federally-funded initiative to provide low-income communities and households access to solar energy. 
According to a statement from the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy, which is sponsoring the conference, future competitions will focus on improving access to loans for environmental efforts, helping communities and partners leverage federal tax credits and unlocking large-scale financing for high-impact climate projects. Though eligibility will vary, the challenge aims to include a wide range of participants such as local governments, community lenders, schools, faith organizations, nonprofits and solar providers.
During last year’s MI Healthy Climate Conference, Gilchrist announced the Michigan Climate Justice Challenge, offering $11 million in grant and technical assistance to help Michigan communities in competing for federal funding. The state also announced a mobility challenge aimed at improving access to Michigan’s national parks through innovations in small-scale electric shuttles and automated driving systems, multimodal electric charging hubs and micro-mobility like scooters and e-bikes.
“All that is to say, we’ve laid a foundation… We’ve tested some things out,” Gilchrist said. 
“Now that we know when something works a little bit, we have to scale it up quickly so it can work a lot in every group, in more markets in more communities, in more circumstances,” Gilchrist said, emphasizing the importance of inviting people from all of Michigan’s communities to participate in efforts to combat climate change and build up the state’s clean energy and mobility economy. 
“We cannot get where we need to go if we don’t bring everybody along with us,” Gilchrist said, telling attendees that by building a better connected, more inspired group, the state can begin to realize the clean energy and climate future it deserves.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0779-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 17:08:14.124179

Shelley Moore Capito photo)Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., has called on federal Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to bring back employees of a local National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health office that supports the coal industry. 
At least 200 workers were affected by a reduction-in-force at the Morgantown office earlier this month as a part of a restructuring of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The changes, meant to save $1.8 billion a year, will reduce staffing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees at the department. 
In a letter to Kennedy dated Monday, Capito wrote that she had talked to Kennedy about the agency and the “important work” it does to improve and monitor the health care of coal miners in West Virginia. 
The NIOSH office plays a crucial role in detecting black lung among the nation’s coal miners through its Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program. The program operated a mobile clinic that traveled between coal mines and coal communities. 
The facility’s research on rock dust has led to safety changes to prevent explosions in underground mines, Capito said. 
“I ask that the department bring back not only the functions of the NIOSH coal offices and programs, but also some of the specialized employees impacted by the April 1 HHS-wide Reduction in Force who do this important work in Morgantown, West Virginia,” Capito wrote. 
Earlier this month, Capito joined President Donald Trump at the White House as he signed executive orders meant to bolster the country’s declining coal industry. The orders allowed some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to continue producing electricity, directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lifted barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands, according to the Associated Press. 
“The president’s executive orders are welcome news for our miners and will help ensure all Americans have access to affordable and reliable energy resources like coal,” Capito wrote. “As the president recognizes the importance of coal, we must also recognize the health of our miners and I encourage you to bring back the NIOSH coal programs and researchers that will help ensure the president’s vision to unleash American energy can be done safely.”
She added that she believes in Trump’s vision to right-size government, but she does not believe that eliminating the NIOSH coal programs and research will accomplish that goal. 
In an emailed response Tuesday, an HHS official said that “The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, along with its critical programs, will join the Administration for a Healthy America alongside multiple agencies to improve coordination of health resources for Americans.”

(Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey prosecutors are asking an appeals court to overturn the dismissal of charges against George Norcross and his allies, arguing a Superior Court judge had effectively invented a new legal standard dissonant with existing law to toss charges against the Democratic power broker.
Judge Peter Warshaw in February dismissed the charges against Norcross and his co-defendants, finding the indictment against them did not state facts constituting extortion or criminal coercion and failed to prove racketeering and other charges lodged against the alleged criminal enterprise.
But prosecutors say in a new filing that Warshaw subjected the indictment to greater scrutiny than the law allows, made determinations that should be left to a jury, and dismissed the case under a standard not used in criminal law. 
“Instead, the trial court simply asked whether there was sufficient evidence cited in the Indictment itself, without reviewing the reams of testimony and exhibits the grand jury saw,” prosecutors wrote.
News of the filing was first reported by New Jersey Globe.
The state in June accused Norcross and others of leveraging threats and their control of Camden government to strongarm a developer into ceding property rights and of coercing the CEO of a Camden nonprofit to use a favored but less advantageous developer before pushing him to resign to make room for a patronage hire.
The charges, lodged against a man widely considered the most powerful unelected New Jerseyan, stunned the state’s political class but did little to diminish the influence of the power broker. Attorneys for Norcross and others have claimed the prosecution is meant to burnish Attorney General Matt Platkin’s image for a future run for political office, criticism they renewed after the case was dismissed.

Prosecutors’ new filing argues Warshaw made numerous errors in dismissing the case, including by improperly engaging in fact-finding, ruling on limited evidence, creating a new standard to review motions to dismiss on the sufficiency of evidence, and failing to properly apply that standard, among other things.
Motions to dismiss filed at such an early stage of a case are limited in their scope and can be based on procedural infirmities like a failure to provide notice, prosecutorial misconduct, or on claims that the law underlying criminal charges is unconstitutional, prosecutors argued.
They said dismissals based on the sufficiency of evidence would require the inclusion of evidence outside the four corners of an indictment and could only be granted if the facts contained in the indictment disproved the possibility of a crime, not whether they alone could prove the crime occurred.
“Nothing about the indictment introduces a ‘fatal flaw’ that more evidence — particularly the evidence that already went to the grand jury — ‘necessarily’ could not cure,” prosecutors said in their appeal.
Warshaw made the ruling without reviewing evidence provided to the grand jury that approved the charges. In their appeal, prosecutors said that evidence included more than 2,000 pages of testimony transcripts, over 6,000 wiretap recordings, and no less than 700 other audio files.
An attorney for George Norcross — who was charged alongside former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, NFI CEO Sidney Brown, Michaels Organization CEO John O’Donnell, and attorneys Philip Norcross (George Norcross’s brother) and Bill Tambussi — derided the appeal as a continuation of a prosecution the defendants have argued is politically motivated.
“The new filing is another failed legal argument by the Attorney General — the only difference is that this redux version is longer than the original. The fatal legal flaws remain. As has become obvious to everyone, Mr. Platkin’s obsession has been a political prosecution from its inception. We look forward to again rebutting his fatuous claims on the merits,” said Michael Critchley, an attorney for George Norcross.
Prosecutors argued that Warshaw erred by subjecting the prosecution’s 111-page indictment to a greater level of scrutiny than would be placed on a shorter document, noting courts have routinely rejected efforts to hold lengthier, detail-laden indictments to a stricter standard.
Even if the judge’s legal test was sound, prosecutors said, the dismissal must be overturned because he did not accept as true the indictment’s factual allegations or view them in the light most favorable to the state. They pointed to his ruling that alleged threats made by Norcross and others against Philadelphia-based developer Carl Dranoff were “hard bargaining” and “sabre-rattling.” 
“If a court has questions about what a threat means, or how a victim interprets it, the proper forum is trial testimony, or, at the least, a review of the actual evidence presented to the grand jury,” the appeal says.
The judge’s determination on the criminality of the alleged threats overstepped into improper fact-finding that ought to be left to a jury, as did his determinations about the intent of some co-defendants, all without a review of the evidence, prosecutors said.
Even if the judge’s finding that the alleged threats amounted to only hard bargaining were valid, prosecutors said, the indictment’s extortion and coercion charges should not have been dismissed because the indictment alleges Norcross and his allies controlled Camden government and used governmental power to pressure Dranoff into concessions.
“While defendants may incorrectly believe that wielding the threat of reputational and governmental harm to extract property or submission from others is permissible activity that ‘occurs every day in politics and business’ … New Jersey law, like the Hobbs Act, makes clear it is unlawful,” the appeal said.

,DC,2025-04-22 20:00:10+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Transgender troops ban, nationwide freeze argued in U.S. appeals court",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/transgender-troops-ban-nationwide-freeze-argued-us-appeals-court,,"WASHINGTON — A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday grilled the Trump administration and the attorney for transgender service members who won a lower court order reversing President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender troops.One judge on the panel voiced serious concerns about the lack of evidence the Defense Department cited when instituting the ban, while another expressed skepticism that the lower court’s nationwide order — instead of applying only to the transgender individuals who brought the case — was appropriate.Administration officials appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit after district Judge Ana Reyes, appointed by former President Joe Biden, granted a broad preliminary injunction blocking Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order.Eight active-duty service members and transgender individuals who are actively pursuing enlistment in the armed forces brought the case against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, among other officials and three branches of the U.S. military.Trump’s January order asserted the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.” Further, the order said that being transgender is “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”The Trump administration is expected to “imminently” escalate a separate case on the same issue to the Supreme Court, U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jason Manion said in court Tuesday.EvidenceJudges on the appeals bench queried both sides on whether the government has evidence to prove transgender individuals cannot fulfill military duties, and if the order bans all trans troops or only those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a clinical diagnosis involving distress when a person’s gender identity differs from their sex at birth.“If the military said people with red hair are just too fragile and vulnerable, we are going to kick them all out of the military, and we are going to not allow any of them ever to join, and we have no evidence of that, but we think they're a threat to military preparedness, to unit cohesion, and too costly, and so we're just going to kick them out?” asked Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed during President Barack Obama’s second term.Manion replied the transgender ban “policy relies on a condition that is marked by severe clinical distress.”Under military deference — meaning the courts generally defer to the president and military on national security questions — the judges should accept Trump’s and Hegseth’s word on the policy, Manion said.“If there are mental conditions that will impair someone's ability to function in the military, or that the military could rationally judge would impair that, then that's more than enough to satisfy rational basis review,” he said.Pillard pushed back: Isn’t that the case for all people wanting to join the military, not just transgender individuals? Thousands of transgender troops are already serving, she said.“If the concerns are with depression or suicidality, there already are standards that would screen someone out for those things, right?” Pillard said.Trial court ‘overreach’?Judge Neomi Rao challenged the plaintiffs’ likelihood to succeed, highlighting that the Supreme Court generally views broad orders from district judges as “overreach.”Reyes’ order covers all transgender troops and those seeking to enlist, not just the eight plaintiffs who brought the case.“The district court imposed effectively a universal injunction on this policy, going beyond any relief to these particular plaintiffs. So even putting aside the constitutional question, isn't the government likely to succeed on challenging this remedy?” asked Rao, who was appointed during Trump’s first term.Shannon Minter, civil rights attorney for the plaintiffs, said “the very nature of the injury” justifies far-reaching court protection.“This is one of those cases where the injury alleged resides directly in the categorical nature of the policy itself, which declares that transgender people as a group lack the virtues of honesty, discipline, selflessness, integrity, that as such, they have to be purged from the military because they're transgender, and because the government has this very negative view of what it means to be a transgender person,” Minter said.In a separate case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling that allowed transgender troops to continue serving, denying the government’s appeal.U.S. Supreme Court case upcomingJudge Gregory Katsas, appointed during Trump’s first term, asked Manion, “Can you tell us anything about the government's plans for seeking Supreme Court (review)?”“I can't give you an exact date, but it will be very, very quickly, very soon, and I think that may well be quite relevant to this court’s analysis as well,” Manion said.Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Foundation, who are representing plaintiffs in the 9th Circuit case, released a statement Tuesday afternoon saying they “stand ready to continue to zealously represent our clients as we have at every juncture.”“Transgender service members have been openly serving our country with honor and distinction for almost a decade and have met and are meeting every neutral service-based standard. The U.S. Supreme Court should reject the invitation to stay the district court’s injunction so that they can impose their discriminatory ban while the litigation proceeds,” the statement said.",,,,2025-04-22 16:10:23.762163

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.













We're only one wildfire away from bankruptcy. Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.


– Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association





The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
 Western state legislatures consider laws to protect utilities from negligence charges

Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and Montana lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, while a North Dakota bill passed the Senate but was narrowly defeated in the House. An Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
 Legal immunity for wildfire liability? It may play out in court.

Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.

“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

(Photo by Getty Images)As top federal health officials are encouraging states to stop adding fluoride to public water, a Maine lawmaker introduced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit the practice in the state, drawing strong pushback from the dental community.
Introducing her bill during a public hearing with the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) said in written remarks that fluoridating drinking water is an outdated practice that undermines informed consent.
“Fluoridating drinking water amounts to mass medication without the ability to monitor individual dosage or gain consent,” Poirier wrote in testimony read on her behalf by Rep. Kathy Javner (R-Chester).  
Poirier’s bill, LD 1570, would repeal the law governing the process for a public water system to add fluoride, prohibit systems from adding fluoride and institute a civil penalty for intentionally violating the prohibition.
Communities have been adding fluoride to drinking water for decades to help prevent cavities by strengthening the surface of teeth and making them more resistant to decay. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website calls it “a practical, cost-effective, and equitable way for communities to improve their residents’ oral health.”
More than 60 community water systems that provide drinking water to more than 520,000 people in Maine currently add fluoride, according to information on the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention website. 
Current state law allows public water systems to decide whether to fluoridate drinking water with voter approval from the affected municipalities. Voters in Southwest Harbor, for example, decided to stop adding fluoride to their water in 2013 after more than 50 years of doing so, as reported by the Ellsworth American. 
With a shortage of dental providers in the state, multiple pediatric dentists and nonprofit dental organizations opposed the proposed ban, arguing it is the only source of oral healthcare many children in the state receive. Eliminating fluoride would cause more cavities, pain and other ramifications that come with tooth decay that they argued would be harder to treat with already long waitlists for patients to access dental care. 
Dr. Ashley Blanchfield with Augusta Pediatric Dentistry said she lived and worked in Juneau, Alaska, for several years after it stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water in 2007. She told the committee that she fears Maine could see the same negative effects she saw in children’s dental health in Alaska in the post-fluoridation years. 
Poirier’s bill comes after Utah passed a law in March becoming the first state in the nation to prohibit adding fluoride to drinking water. 
Earlier this month, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called on states to follow Utah’s lead by banning fluoride in drinking water and told the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention he wanted it to stop recommending it be added to public water. 
This comes after Kennedy criticized fluoride throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, saying it has been associated with negative health impacts. While ingesting too much fluoride can be harmful, those risks are associated with levels much higher than the CDC recommendation for drinking water.
Fluoride is naturally occurring in most water, but it is usually at levels too low to prevent cavities, which is why health officials have put forth suggestions for adding more. The CDC said it recommends fluoride levels equal to about three drops in a 55-gallon barrel; however, it is up to individual communities whether they adjust their levels to that recommendation. 
The CDC also named fluoridation of community drinking water one of 10 great public health interventions of the 20th century because of the decline in cavities since it started in 1945.

Andy Barr confirmed his run for U.S. Senate by unveiling a video Tuesday.
Barr’s announcement comes as no surprise after weeks of speculation following Sen. Mitch McConnell’s announcement in February that he would not seek reelection. McConnell has held the seat since 1984.  
In the video, Barr  denounces “insane DEI initiatives,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that Trump has banned in the federal government and is moving to end elsewhere. Barr echoes also Trump’s presidential campaign’s emphasis on transgender issues, vowing to “lock up the sickos who allow biological men to share locker rooms with our daughters.”

Republican Daniel Cameron, a former Kentucky attorney general, announced his candidacy on social media as soon as McConnell ended his announcement that he would not run. It’s Cameron’s first foray back into Kentucky politics after losing the 2023 gubernatorial election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Cameron reported having raised $508,000 for his Senate run as of March 31.
Meanwhile, Barr raised $1.8 million in the same period and has $5.3 million on hand, according to federal campaign finance reports.
Barr, of Lexington, was first elected to the House in 2013. Currently, he is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chairman of the Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. He also serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Barr in December lost a Republican caucus vote to be chairman of the powerful Financial Services Committee, which oversees U.S. banking  and monetary policy. He had earlier said a House committee chairmanship would preclude his running for the Senate, McClatchy reported.
In the weeks leading up to Barr’s announcement, the congressman was among Republicans facing pressure from their constituents to have an in-person town hall over growing frustrations with President Donald Trump’s agenda. Last month, more than 900 people gathered for a town hall at the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington, but Barr declined to attend. He did have a telephone town hall days later. 
The Republican primary looks to be contentious between Barr and Cameron, particularly as they seek a coveted endorsement from Trump. Cameron had Trump’s backing for his failed 2023 race. Barr has recently emphasized his support for the president’s agenda and for his billionaire adviser Elon Musk. At a White House event earlier this month, Trump said while acknowledging Barr’s attendance: “Good luck with everything. I hear good things.”  
A possible third candidate, Lexington-based businessman Nate Morris, has also been mulling a run for Senate but has not made a formal announcement. Morris has gained the eye of Trump world allies, including the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Morris’ support for the president’s tariff plans was also included in a recent White House press release. 
On the Democratic side, House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, has announced her candidacy for the race. Like Cameron, she was a statewide candidate in 2023, losing the attorney general race to Republican Russell Coleman. Rocky Adkins, a senior adviser to Beshear and former state House Democratic floor leader, has not ruled out a Senate run himself. 
Barr’s Senate candidacy now opens the race for Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District — a seat in central Kentucky that Democrats are hoping to flip.

(Screenshot from news conference)New Mexico’s top state prosecutor says he will begin a formal investigation into what led up to the death of an Albuquerque teenager and the broader problems at the state’s beleaguered child welfare agency.
Searchlight New Mexico reports that earlier this month, 16-year-old Jaydun Garcia took his own life in a former Albuquerque halfway house built for girls transitioning out of juvenile detention.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez held a new conference on Tuesday morning announcing a formal investigation into Garcia’s death, but also other incidents of children who have been harmed while in Children, Youth and Families Department custody.
“The State of New Mexico failed to protect this child,” Torrez said. “The State of New Mexico has failed to honor its legal and moral obligations under a variety of legal agreements that they have entered into.”
Torrez said the public has very little information about what happened to Garcia, who was responsible for him in the days and weeks before his death and the decisions made and resources dedicated to preventing it.
“How can we expect to improve that system if we don’t know what happened, if we don’t have answers, if we don’t have transparency?” Torrez said. “I’m prepared to test the law in this space, and I’m prepared to advocate fundamentally for a change in the law, if that is what’s required.”
The investigation is not limited to Garcia’s death but will extend to state agencies charged with protecting children, Torrez said.
The Department of Justice will conduct “a comprehensive and wide-ranging investigation into various reports of children who have been referred to CYFD” as victims of abuse and neglect, placed in congregate care and other facilities, improperly housed at CYFD offices, sexually assaulted in those offices, or abused by armed guards in those offices, Torrez said.
“Enough is enough,” Torrez said. “I will not tolerate the excuses, the assurances, I think we have all grown tired of waking up and hearing about another child who’s been injured, another child who’s been hurt, another child in state custody who’s been killed, and for that reason, the New Mexico Department of Justice will initiate a formal investigation into the facts and circumstances that led up to the death Jaydun Garcia.”
New Mexico Child First Network Founder and Executive Director Maralyn Beck, a former foster parent, joined Torrez at the news conference, saying Garcia’s death was preventable.
“The signs were there, and we should not be housing our children in warehouses of neglect like congregate care,” Beck said. “One single call to Child Protective Services should have prevented this.”
She said what foster children need to heal from their trauma is homes, and excellent parenting through committed, developmentally informed relationships with adults.
“It is through transparency, it is through peeling back the layer of confidentiality to figure out what happened,” Beck said.
Disability Rights New Mexico Chief Executive Officer Gary Housepian also appeared alongside Torrez and Beck during the news conference. In a news release afterwards, Housepian said in a statement that Garcia’s death is “a devastating reminder of what happens when vulnerable children — especially those with disabilities or behavioral health needs — fall through the cracks of a broken system.”
“We’ve been raising alarms for years about placements in congregate settings, and it’s long past time for a comprehensive, independent investigation. We stand ready to coordinate our investigation of this death, monitoring of facilities and to support the Attorney General in demanding the transparency and accountability these children and youth deserve,” Housepian said.

Probe will guide new oversight office
The broader investigation into other incidents will develop a detailed record of events leading up to the deaths or great bodily injury of children under CYFD’s supervision but also the policies, procedures and people involved, the Department of Justice said in the news release.
The investigation will take several months, Torrez said. Its ultimate objective, he said, is to prepare a comprehensive report for the incoming Office of the Child Advocate, which New Mexico’s lawmakers created in the most recent legislative session and is administratively attached to Torrez’s agency.
That report will be “a blueprint of the issues that have plagued this agency and this state for decades,” Torrez said.
The Department of Justice said in a news release that the new office was created “despite Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s attempt to veto its funding.” Even though Lujan Grisham signed the legislation to create the office, she vetoed $1.65 million that would have covered the start-up costs to create it, and she and the AG’s office traded barbs over the bill.
Torrez said he does not yet know if CYFD will resist the investigation, and he hopes the governor’s rhetoric around the legislation and the line-item veto are “not indicative of the administration’s position moving forward.”
“I won’t be deterred in any way by the resistance of other stakeholders in this situation,” he said. “My hope is that can be avoided.”
Source NM sent emails to spokespeople for CYFD and the governor seeking comment and will update this story as necessary.
Torrez’s agency is also calling on current and former case workers, foster families, and youth impacted by the system to come forward with information by going to the “Get Help” page on its website or by calling (505) 490-4060. He also encouraged the public to sign up to become foster parents themselves.
He said he’s committed to getting the answers necessary “to move this state and this agency in a new direction.”
“It is my hope that by shining a light on the problems inside of the agency and on the problems that New Mexico has in protecting its most vulnerable children, that we will begin the necessary process of fulfilling not only our legal obligation to our most vulnerable citizens, but fulfilling our moral obligation to do right by these kids.”

(Main photo courtesy of the University of Iowa; form courtesy of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security)Four University of Iowa students and graduates from China and India, one of whom works for the state as an epidemiologist, are suing the federal government for revoking their status as students.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, was filed by a UI College of Law professor on behalf of the four plaintiffs, identified in court records only as John Doe No. 1 through 4.

Named as defendants are Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is a part. Also named as a defendant is Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons.
According to the lawsuit, each of the plaintiffs was admitted to the United States on an F-1 student visa. The plaintiffs claim the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has violated their due process rights by terminating their student status earlier this month without legal justification or explanation.
Since beginning their studies, the lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs have maintained their status as students, are in good academic standing and have not committed any serious criminal offenses. Three of the four are studying chemical engineering, economics or exercise science, while the fourth is working for the State of Iowa as an epidemiologist.
The lawsuit claims that on April 10, 2025, ICE abruptly canceled, without explanation, the plaintiffs’ status as students within DHS’ Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database. The same day, the plaintiffs each received emails from the University of Iowa’s International Students and Scholars Services informing them of the cancellation and the fact that the university was not responsible for the action.
Four days later, the lawsuit claims, three of the plaintiffs’ visas were revoked without explanation. The three each received identical messages from U.S. embassies, warning them that “remaining in the United States can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation,” and adding that “deportation can take place at a time that does not allow the person being deported to secure possessions or conclude affairs in the United States. Persons being deported may be sent to countries other than their countries of origin.”
Lawsuit alleges threats and coercion
The lawsuit is challenging what it calls the Department of Homeland Security’s “misuse of the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems to further unlawful ends,” alleging that DHS has initiated a policy of “coercing international students into self-deportation by leveraging ambiguous student-status revocations, coupled with visa revocation notices and threatening language.”
The lawsuit claims Homeland Security’s “lack of transparency and procedural safeguards created chaos within educational institutions and upended the lives of lawful F-1 visa holders.”
The lawsuit emphasizes that the plaintiffs are not challenging the revocation of their F-1 student visas but are instead challenging DHS’ termination of their student status to create a “pretext for future adverse immigration actions against them.”
The plaintiffs are now “experiencing intense mental and financial suffering because they cannot continue with their studies, and fear being detained and removed if they do so,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit also claims the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database was created by Congress to be an administrative tool for oversight and compliance of international student visas and was never intended to be an “a weapon of immigration policy.”
Federal regulations prescribe the three specific circumstances in which DHS can terminate student status, such as unauthorized employment, providing false information, or committing a violent crime — and the plaintiffs allege none of those criteria apply to their case.
The terminations are without legal justification, have violated constitutional guarantees of procedural due process, violate DHS’s own regulations and policies, and are “far beyond DHS’ statutory authority,” the lawsuit claims.
The plaintiff’s petition describes John Doe No. 1 as an Indian national who resides in Iowa City and is a fourth-year Ph.D. student studying chemical engineering. He first came to the United States on an F-1 visa in 2021. The lawsuit alleges his only criminal history is a speeding ticket and a misdemeanor conviction for drunken driving.
John Doe No. 2 is a Chinese national and third-year undergraduate student who resides in Tiffin. His only interactions with law enforcement are alleged to be for speeding, driving without a valid driver’s license and a disorderly conduct conviction.
John Doe No. 3 is a Chinese national living in Iowa City and is both a third-year undergraduate and pre-doctorate student at the university. The lawsuit indicates he has been convicted of first-offense drunken driving, and has two speeding citations, one failure-to-yield citation, and one citation for driving without a valid driver’s license.
John Doe No. 4 is an Indian national, a master of public health graduate of the University of Iowa, and a practicing epidemiologist working for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. His only interaction with law enforcement is alleged to be an arrest for drunken driving that was later expunged from court records.
The plaintiffs are represented by University of Iowa law student practitioners Mikhail Acherkan, Jude Hagerman, Angela Pandit, Ian Reeves, Justin Rempe and Isabella Siragusa, under the direct supervision of Katherine Melloy Goettel, clinical associate professor at the university’s College of Law.
The Department of Homeland Security has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and, in response to a request for comment, provided only a statement “on background.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/U-of-I.jpg,,,2025-04-22 16:10:23.762163

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)State driver’s license offices in five Arkansas cities will be open Saturday to accommodate demand for REAL IDs, which will be required for all Americans to board flights or enter certain federal buildings starting May 7, the department announced Tuesday.
REAL IDs are signified by a gold star on a driver’s license or state-issued ID cards. The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration has issued roughly 140,000 REAL IDs since Jan. 1, including 52,000 in March, bringing the statewide total to roughly 800,000, Secretary Jim Hudson said in a news conference.
All 134 DMVs statewide can issue REAL IDs in person, Hudson said.
The five offices open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday will be in Little Rock, Fayetteville, Jonesboro, Texarkana and Monticello, according to a news release.
“We will only be issuing REAL IDs in those offices this Saturday so we can focus on serving those customers who have the greatest need for it, particularly if you plan to travel in the coming future,” Hudson said. “…I don’t want anybody going to the airport and getting turned away and having their travel plans frustrated because you don’t have a REAL ID.”
Appointments for Saturday are recommended but not required, and people can schedule appointments on the finance department website.
REAL IDs began with a law passed by Congress in 2005 as a response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
Applicants for REAL IDs need to pay a $40 fee and provide the finance department with four different forms of identification:

A current driver’s license, state-issued ID, or school or work ID as proof of identity
A passport or birth certificate as proof of legal presence in the United States
A government-issued social security card
Two documents providing proof of address, such as utility bills or bank statements, issued within the last six months

The documents “all have to sync up,” making the process more secure than the one to apply for a regular driver’s license because it’s difficult to falsify all four documents, Hudson said.
Individuals who have legally changed their names will need to provide proof of doing so, such as a marriage license or divorce decree, according to the finance department.
Arkansans should remember that obtaining a social security card “may take a little bit of time” since the federal government must deliver it to the requester via snail mail, state revenue commissioner Charlie Collins said at the news conference.
Arkansas drivers can get digital licenses, but don’t get rid of your printed one yet

The federal Transportation Security Administration accepts passports in place of REAL IDs as identification to board a flight, but federal buildings under the jurisdiction of other agencies, such as courthouses and nuclear power facilities, might have different ID requirements for entry, Hudson said.
The finance department has been focused “on making the REAL ID process as smooth, convenient and accessible to Arkansans as it can possibly be made,” including by providing REAL IDs the day they are requested instead of mailing them to applicants weeks later, Collins said.
He added that about 20,000 Arkansans have opted into the finance department’s new option for a digital driver’s license, which also functions as a REAL ID if someone has provided the proper documentation.
Additionally, Arkansans can choose whether to renew their driver’s licenses for an additional fee while obtaining a REAL ID if the license has not yet expired, Hudson said.

(Photo by Getty Images)A House panel advanced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit health care providers from treating minors with sexually transmitted infections and diseases without their parents’ consent.
The proposals, HB 1505 and SB 1288, have cleared all of their committee stops in both chambers following the favorable House committee vote Tuesday, putting them closer to passage.
Under the banner of parental rights, lawmakers are pushing for the removal of exceptions entitling minors in Florida to privacy with doctors and medical providers to receive treatment for STIs, substance abuse, and mental health problems. In some cases, doctors can prescribe birth control to minors without their parents’ written consent.
“We believe that children and parents are going to be more engaged with each other. We’ve allowed the default in certain circumstances in this state to be institutions making a decision other than the family, where it should be,” said Lake Mary Republican Rep. Rachel Plakon, one of the sponsors of the bill, before the House Education and Employment Committee.
Reproductive rights advocates, Democrats, and some Republicans oppose the bill, saying it could restrict access to treatment for minors who can’t trust their parents.
The change could come at a time when Florida teens are contracting chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis at the highest rates since 2008, according to 2023 data from the Florida Department of Health. Those infections can be cured with antibiotics, but worsen if left untreated.
“I want you to remember that this is the Legislature that talks about life, and STIs that go untreated cause infertility, so that is not life,” said Michelle Grimsley Shindano, director of public policy for the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.
Although the bill originally also required parental consent for examination for STDs, the sponsors in both chambers changed the requirement to only apply to treatment and left the exception in place for minors whose parents are being investigated for a crime against them.
Plakon said that she wants to remove a “loophole” in Florida law that allows physicians to prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.
“We just thought it was too vague,” Plakon said.
Another provision would require parents to opt into surveys at schools, including those regarding political affiliations, mental or psychological problems, sexual behavior, self-incriminating behavior, and religion.
During an emotional moment during the bill’s last committee stop in the Senate Monday, Stuart Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell teared up while she talked about her late husband’s work as an OBGYN treating young women.
“He would roll over in his grave right now. I’m a no,” she said.

(Graphic courtesy of the South Carolina Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault)On April 11, 2018, I received a call from Sgt. Stokes of the Louisville, Kentucky, police department’s Sex Crimes Unit. I could tell by his voice that something was wrong.
“Evelyn,” he said, “I hate to tell you this, but the evidence in your case was destroyed on June 30, 1982.”
Silence. His last words were “this never should have happened.”
The destroyed evidence was mine and my friends’ rape kits and the blindfolds used on us on Feb. 29, 1980, when we were abducted, driven to an unknown house, forced to remove our clothes and jewelry, thrown on the floor like trash, raped, sodomized and beaten by several unknown men all night long.
The next day we were driven to a place, fully expecting to be killed (and not really caring at that point), left alone, naked and badly beaten.
When the police found us, we were taken to the hospital where our wounds were treated, and a sexual assault exam was done. I still remember the cold steel of the exam table on my naked, bruised, exhausted body and the pain of having a small comb rake through my pubic and head hair.
The last thing any victim of rape wants is to be touched by anyone, and the only reason they justify the loss of dignity and discomfort of that exam is because they believe it will help identify their assailant.
Why else would an exam and sexual assault kit be so carefully collected?
After the initial shock wore off from that phone call, I felt a sense of determination that I hadn’t felt since that night when we tried to escape. I thought of my two daughters and what I would do if this happened to one of them.
I would say, “No, we are not going to accept this, we must do something to change this epic failure of our law enforcement and justice system.”
I reached out to the Julie Valentine Center in Greenville. I needed emotional support from revisiting that trauma, and I knew I had to share my story with someone who might be able to help prevent this from happening to other victims.
There had been news stories from all over the country about the backlog of rape kits. Thousands upon thousands had been sitting on shelves in warehouses, never tested, never even accounted for. Who knew how many had been destroyed like mine?
I began working with the Julie Valentine Center to gather statistics and educate legislators on the failure of local and state law enforcement’s handling of sexual assault kits.
It was astounding how many kits we discovered were A) sitting in labs across the state; 2) unaccounted for; and 3) how few had been tested compared to the number collected.
Shauna Galloway-Williams, the center’s CEO, and I made numerous trips to Columbia where I testified before House and Senate subcommittees and told my story over and over – every time with sweat rolling down my back.
Due to our efforts, the Statewide Sexual Assault Kit Tracking System (H 3309) was passed unanimously and signed into law on May 14, 2020!
It forced accountability of law enforcement, crime labs and medical facilities and most importantly, gave hope to survivors to know their kit wasn’t going to be destroyed or ignored.
Implementation of the tracking system faced delay after delay. In 2024, it finally went live across South Carolina for law enforcement agencies, medical facilities, and prosecutor’s offices.
I wish I could say that I have heard good things, but I haven’t.
A legislative audit of the State Law Enforcement Division’s implementation of the tracking system outlined many issues (which SLED disagreed with in its response to the report completed last October).
Some days I just don’t have the energy to keep fighting. Other days, I don’t want to stop pushing back.
I have to sustain hope that the identified issues will be addressed and that we all continue to push for timely testing of the evidence survivors of rape provide in the wake of such intimate violations.
I lost a huge part of my life because of what happened in 1980.
I am now stronger and proud I was a part of a major reform to empower survivors to demand accountability by those we entrust our literal DNA to.
Protect those sexual assault kits as the real evidence they are, test them, use them to prosecute and to convict those who commit these violent crimes before they hurt someone else.

(Hulton Archive/Getty Images).A significant rollback for child labor laws in Florida received approval in its third and final committee stop in the House on Tuesday. The same bill would speed up a state preemption of local living-wage laws in nearly a dozen cities and counties.
It added insult to injury to its critics via a late-filed amendment that would speed up a preemption against local-living wage laws in nearly a dozen Florida cities and counties that require their contractors to pay employees a wage that’s higher than the state’s minimum.
The original proposal (HB 1225), sponsored by Brevard freshman Republican Rep. Monique Miller, would allow employers during the school year to schedule any 16- and 17-year-old Floridian to work for unlimited hours and days without breaks. It would also allow employers to schedule 14- and 15-year-olds who have graduated from high school or are home or virtual-school students for unlimited hours and days without breaks.
Those specific provisions would repeal the existing prohibition on scheduling 16- and 17-year olds from working more than 8 hours in any day when school is scheduled for the next day, except when the day or work falls on a holiday or Sunday. It would repeal the limit for scheduling a 16- and 17-year-old to work no more than 30 hours in one week.
“Due to resurgence of apprenticeships and such, we want to reduce barriers to teenagers learning their trade and getting prepared for their careers,” Miller told the House Commerce Committee. “There are currently certain waiver programs that give government the power to decide whether or not teenagers should work. I believe that power rests with the parents.”
A similar proposal was introduced in the 2024 legislative session but was watered down, in part due to considerable pushback from the public. This year’s versions in the House and the Senate ignore that criticism — and come after the Orlando Weekly revealed that staffers within Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office emailed draft legislation to Miller and Jay Collins, sponsor of the Senate version.
Miller told lawmakers that one motivation for her bill was to eliminate “barriers” so that parents could decide what was best for their kids when it comes to early employment.
Tampa Bay area Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner asked Miller what barriers now prohibit parents of 16- and 17-year-olds in school to work more than 30 hours. Miller did not appear to directly respond to that inquiry, prompting Rayner to later say that she had been troubled that she could not get direct answers on a policy question.
“It’s disheartening and disrespectful to the process when decorum is sacrificed in the name of partisanship,” she said.
All of the Democrats on the committee and one Republican — Panhandle Rep. Michelle Salzman — voted against the proposal.
“This bill strips away any type of foundational oversight requirement for breaks, limitations of hours during school, under the guise of parental rights. Meanwhile, the bill has no requirements for parental consent, no requirements for a break,” said Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani.
An amended version of Miller’s bill introduced on Tuesday added a provision that angered critics. It would speed up a law passed in a contentious bill a year ago to block 11 local governments in the state from requiring contractors to pay more than the state’s minimum wage. The provision would speed up the date that law will go into effect from September 2026 to September 2025.
When asked by Winter Garden Democratic Rep. Leonard Spencer why she was making that change in her bill, Miller said, “My understanding is that they were ready to move forward now,” without mentioning who “they” were.
That insertion did not go unrecognized by members of the public.
“These are working families that make currently $17.45 an hour,” said Jess McCarty, executive assistant county attorney for Miami-Dade County. “The new language on this 50th day of the session would take away health benefits. It would eliminate these living wages that are offered only on county contracts.”
“This amendment is a bombshell,” added Jackson Oberlink with the progressive group Florida For All. “This isn’t just about child labor anymore. It’s a full-scale assault on working people and local democracy. And worse, it sets a trap. This language opens up a section of law ripe for future anti-worker amendments to be slipped in at the last minute, circumventing the committee process and public testimony.”

While the measure’s passage now means it will go to the full House for a vote, its odds of ultimately getting to DeSantis desk for his signature remains uncertain. The Senate version (SB 918), sponsored by Hillsborough County Republican Collins, has only passed one of three committees to which it is assigned — and Tuesday was the last day that any committees are scheduled to convene in the Senate.
Minimum wage
Meanwhile, another controversial proposal that would allow employers to pay certain employees less than the minimum wage may also be dying in the Senate.
The legislation, sponsored by Lee County Republican Jonathan Martin (SB 676), says that if an employee is working a structured work-study, internship, pre-apprenticeship, or “other similar work” and voluntarily signs a waiver, their employer can pay them less than the state minimum wage, now set at $13 an hour. Parents and guardians must sign the wavier for employees under 18 years of age.
These “work-based learning opportunities” may not last longer than nine months or two full-time semesters in school consisting of at least 15 credit hours each.
Martin told questioning Democrats on the Senate Rules Committee on Monday night that he intends his bill to deal with what he described as a decades-long decline in the labor force for teenagers and young adults. He hopes, he said, that the bill could encourage employers to hire young people.
“I want to have more young adults or teenagers to learn basic job skills,” he said.
Floridians approved a constitutional amendment in 2020 raising the state’s minimum wage by $1 every year until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026. The passage of that amendment immediately raised the minimum wage to $10 in 2021.
There is a no standardized definition of “internship” in Florida law, according to the Senate bill analysis.
With the clock approaching 8 p.m. on Monday night, Martin announced that he was temporarily postponing the bill — which might indicate its chances of passage are fleeting, as this was the last time the Rules Committee would meet this session.
Rich Templin of the Florida AFL-CIO said on Tuesday that the bill simply wasn’t ready for primetime.
“There was no agency authority, there was no parameters [in the bill] on how to set up an internship,” he said. “There’s no educational goals. There’s not even [a definition] of what a waiver form would look like. There would literally be no way for businesses to implement it, which would lead to failed attempts, lots of lawsuits.”
A similar proposal in the House (HB 841), sponsored by Ocala Republican Ryan Chamberlain, has cleared all of its committee stops and is awaiting a vote in the full chamber.

U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s 35-page order […],"The ICE detention facility in Aurora. (Robert Davis for Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Tuesday granted a motion for a temporary restraining order blocking the removal of detainees held in Colorado under the 1798 law that President Donald Trump’s administration has invoked to send hundreds of people to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador.
U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney’s 35-page order came one day after an initial hearing in the case, which was brought as a petition for habeas corpus and proposed class action by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of two Venezuelan nationals held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora.
Sweeney’s order, which will remain in effect until at least May 6, applies to the two plaintiffs and members of the class they seek to represent — “all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who were, are, or will be subject to” Trump’s March 14 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. That could apply to more than 100 people detained at the Aurora facility, ACLU attorneys have estimated.

In addition to ordering that the Trump administration “shall not move Petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class outside the District of Colorado,” Sweeney instructed the government to begin giving at least 21 days’ notice to detainees targeted for removal under Trump’s proclamation.
“Such notice must state the government intends to remove individuals pursuant to the Act and Proclamation,” Sweeney wrote. “It must also provide notice of a right to seek judicial review, and inform individuals they may consult an attorney regarding their detainment and the government’s intent to remove them. Such notice must be written in a language the individual understands.”
Trump’s order invoking the Alien Enemies Act claims that the United States is under “invasion” by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. It was the basis for the deportation last month of 137 migrants to El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, where the U.S. government is paying for them to be held. At least 11 deportees were previously held in Colorado, attorneys for the plaintiffs said after Monday’s hearing.
Trump has pledged to begin sending American citizens to the CECOT facility, criticized by human rights groups for its crowded and abusive conditions. About 90% of the deportees sent there last month had no criminal record. At least one, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was removed as a result of an “administrative error,” while advocates, attorneys and family members for many other deportees say that they were falsely identified as TdA members because of tattoos honoring family members or their favorite soccer team.
Other federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have ordered the Trump administration to halt Alien Enemies Act deportations and provide detainees the opportunity to contest their removal and alleged gang ties. But ACLU attorneys allege the administration is refusing to comply with that order and providing detainees with insufficient notice of 24 hours or less. Trump has also openly defied a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia, leading some Democrats to declare a constitutional crisis.
Plaintiffs in the Colorado case are identified by their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M. They both deny being members of TdA.
D.B.U. is a 32-year-old asylum seeker who has lived in Colorado with his wife and two children. R.M.M. is also a Colorado resident who is seeking asylum. He says that he fled Venezuela to escape TdA, which killed his wife’s father and uncle and which he fears will kill him and his wife and children.
Representing the Trump administration during Monday’s hearing, the office of the U.S. Attorney for Colorado argued that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case because ICE officials had determined that D.B.U. and R.M.M. are not covered by Trump’s proclamation. But the government’s attorneys could not rule out the possibility that that determination could change in the future, and Sweeney agreed with the plaintiffs that they had “shown a sufficient risk” of such a designation.
“It is not dispositive that D.B.U. and R.M.M. are not ‘currently’ designated as ‘subject’ to the Proclamation when the government may revise this designation at any time — and failed to eliminate that possibility, or the speed with which such re-designation could occur, when asked directly at oral argument,” she wrote.
“Practically speaking, a TRO would inflict little more on Respondents than ensure they adhere to the requirement the Supreme Court has already imposed on them: give Petitioners and putative class members adequate notice, with adequate time, to adequately pursue habeas relief,” Sweeney’s order added.
The U.S. Attorney’s office declined to comment Tuesday. Following the granting of the TRO, plaintiffs in the Colorado case are expected to file a motion for a longer-lasting preliminary injunction. Sweeney directed the plaintiffs to file such a motion, if they choose to do so, by Friday.
Echoing preliminary findings by other federal judges, including D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, Sweeney wrote that the ACLU’s challenge to the Alien Enemies Act removals are “likely to succeed on the merits.” The act has been invoked on only three previous occasions and only during war, most recently during World War II as the basis for the incarceration of noncitizens of Japanese, German and Italian descent.
The text of the act, passed during President John Adams’ administration at the height of an undeclared military conflict between the United States and France, refers to the “invasion” of or “predatory incursion” into U.S. territory.
“These words, fundamentally, demand military and wartime action,” Sweeney wrote. “The Proclamation makes no finding that satisfies these definitional demands. Thus, to the extent the Proclamation relies on the Act’s ‘invasion’ and ‘incursion’ provisions to justify its removal powers, it does so improperly.”

Utilities in Oregon and elsewhere are pushing lawmakers to pass liability protections, giving them legal immunity in exchange for following safety plans. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.
 










We're only one wildfire away from bankruptcy. Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.


– Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association




The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and Montana lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, while a North Dakota bill passed the Senate but was narrowly defeated in the House. An Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
California fires show states’ ‘last resort’ insurance plans could be overwhelmed

But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

(Photo courtesy Village Of Los Ranchos)A small team of state employees focused on solving New Mexico’s housing crisis will move from the governor’s office to the state’s workforce agency, a temporary move while the informal office seeks a permanent home. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has sought statutory authority for a state Office of Housing from the New Mexico Legislature for the last two years, but legislation doing so failed in both sessions. Legislation would have empowered the four-person team to create a statewide strategy to solve the housing shortage and attached it administratively to the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, which received more than $100 million this legislative session to spend on housing and homelessness.
In a news release Monday, the governor’s office said the move to the Department of Workforce Solutions will create a strong connection between job creation and housing, plus allow for more accountability after the state’s significant investment in solving the housing crisis here. 
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

“This move will ensure that the Office of Housing has the resources it needs to put these dollars to use solving our state’s housing shortage as we continue pursuing legislation to make the state’s housing and homelessness initiatives permanent,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. 
The move comes a few weeks after the governor fired Daniel Werwath, her senior housing policy adviser tasked with, among other things, convincing lawmakers to approve a state Housing Office. Werwath told Source New Mexico after his departure that he tried to achieve “some systemic change around housing, which apparently there’s less appetite for than I had hoped.”
The state lacks more than 30,000 housing units, according to recent estimates. Employers in Albuquerque, where lawmakers hope the majority of new housing spending will occur, added 31,000 jobs in the last three years, but city developers added only 9,000 new housing units in that period, according to a January report from Pew Charitable Trusts. 
In the coming months, Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair will come up with a recommendation for the office’s permanent home, governor’s spokesperson Michael Coleman told Source New Mexico. 
“It could remain at DWS, move to another agency, or stand alone. There is no firm deadline for the recommendation. The governor is confident that DWS is the right place for the Office of Housing at this time,” Coleman said in an email Tuesday.
Nair, in the news release, said one of the state workforce’s biggest challenges is finding affordable housing. Merging the housing office and the workforce agency will enable “strong collaboration and accountability,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/losranchos-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-04-22 15:08:12.852101

Bills become enrolled acts after passing through both chambers. All ten bills were due for governor action by Tuesday. 
Under Senate Enrolled Act 4, developers of long-haul water pipelines — defined as structures over 30 miles in length transporting more than 10 million gallons a day — must get the sign-off from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and seek certificates of public convenience and necessity.

It also includes strict permitting requirements for transferring water from one water basin to another. Braun’s signature comes on the heels of his Monday executive order to develop a statewide water inventory and management plan. 
Another measure, Senate Enrolled Act 143, would require courts to give deference to parental rights in disputes with government regulators. Opponents called the proposal too broad in committee while some supporters said it didn’t go far enough.
Of the ten bills signed Tuesday, only two are effective immediately. House Bill 1633 would direct the Indiana Secretary of State to study the scheduling of local elections and whether the state should require all counties to use vote centers. 
Another, Senate Enrolled Act 119, prohibits submitting applications for a certificate of public advantage after May 13, 2025, part of an ongoing effort to reduce hospital mergers. 
Just one measure signed Tuesday would be retroactive: Senate Enrolled Act 462, which would define practitioners as it relates to behavior analysts.
All other proposals would be effective on July 1, 2025, when the state’s next fiscal year starts.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/22/ct-appropriations-committee-budget-proposal/,"Panel to endorse new CT budget that aids schools, social services, but exceeds cap. Plan delays employee raises, big bump in Medicaid rates.","This story will be updated.
The legislature’s Appropriations Committee was poised Tuesday to adopt a $55.6 billion, two-year budget that invests in K-12 schools, higher education, child care and other social services — but would require Connecticut to legally exceed its spending cap for the first time since 2007 and reform another key savings program.
The package, released early Tuesday morning and expected to be adopted in the afternoon, also delays raises for most state employees for one year, cancels pay hikes for constitutional officers, underfunds guaranteed health care benefits for retired workers, and rejects bus and rail fare increases sought by Gov. Ned Lamont.
The Democrat-controlled committee would appropriate $27.1 billion next fiscal year, boosting spending 4.3% and exceeding the cap — which aligns spending growth with household income and inflation — by $131 million. Its budget would total $28.4 billion in 2026-27, growing spending 4.9% but falling $26.5 million under the cap in the second year.
A precursor to final budget negotiations with Lamont, the committee spending plan is more of a rough draft this year than in others. Any state budget adopted before the regular session ends on June 4 likely will be revised dramatically this summer or fall. 
By that time, Congress is expected to have completed an unprecedented plan to cut annual federal spending by $880 billion, reductions projected to cost Connecticut hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly aid at best, billions at worst.
“It’s going to be a balancing act that we still have to go forward with,” said Rep. Toni E. Walker, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee. “It’s going to be painful.”
Even before reckoning with shrinking federal aid, committee leaders say they faced difficult decisions after a series of state budget caps forced Connecticut to save excessively for the past eight years, weakening many core services.
“This is a real budget for real people in real life,” said Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the panel’s other co-chair. “We’ve heard people talk about what is important to them. This is what the people of Connecticut told us they need.”
Big investments in education
The committee identified many needs in education, particularly at the local, K-12 level.
Legislators pushed back against Lamont earlier this year, ordering $40 million in supplemental aid this fiscal year to local schools to offset what many called a crisis in special education. The School and State Finance Project, a nonpartisan education policy group, estimated districts needed $108 million.
The governor has proposed sending schools an extra $40 million annually for special education — but not for another two years. The committee budget released Tuesday maintains the extra $40 million in state payments in both the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years.
The panel also clashed with Lamont on the Education Cost Sharing grant, the main funding program to help cover local elementary and secondary school operating expenses. The committee proposed an extra $26 million in funding over the next two years combined to ensure that about 80 communities would not face a reduction in ECS as called for under the state’s statutory formula. The system weighs local wealth, enrollment totals, and past local education spending in calculating the state’s contribution.
Legislators and the governor also are expected to clash over higher education. 
The Appropriations Committee proposed adding about $15 million above current spending in each of the next two years to the Department of Higher Education, chiefly to fund scholarships.
And it added about $280 million over the coming biennium to support the University of Connecticut and its Farmington-based health center, as well as $146 million to back regional state universities and community colleges.
The governor, other moderate Democrats and Republicans have said higher ed institutions have amassed too much in reserves and should spend those down before they receive extra state funds.
The Connecticut Mirror reported in late March that the system overseeing regional universities and community colleges entered this fiscal year with $611 million in reserve, equal to more than 50% of annual operating expenses. UConn’s main branch in Storrs held a $171 million cushion equal to 10.2% while the health center had $297 million or 18%.
More funds for child care, social services – but little for Medicaid
The Appropriations Committee also took issue with Lamont’s plan to fund the hundreds of community-based, private, nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to people with developmental disabilities and patients struggling with mental health or addiction issues.
The industry says it loses hundreds of millions of dollars annually because state spending on social programs hasn’t kept pace with inflation for decades. 
Lamont proposed giving them an extra $31 million in traditional state funding next fiscal year, and $126 million more than current levels by 2026-27.
But part of the funding state officials used this year to pay for social services, about $50 million, involves temporary federal pandemic grants that largely have been exhausted.
Taking that hit into account, nonprofits would lose $19 million next fiscal year under the governor’s proposal. The committee would add $19 million in extra state funds to ensure there is no loss.
The committee did agree with a proposal from Lamont to take $300 million from this fiscal year’s projected surplus and create an off-budget account to fund investments in early childhood care and education for many years to come. The proposal has been criticized by Republicans, though, who note the off-budget fund is merely an accounting gimmick used to circumvent the state spending cap, which only covers appropriations from within the formal budget.
The committee plan is likely to draw criticism from some rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers for not following through on what many party leaders said was a major priority this year: boosting Medicaid rates for doctors who treat the poor.
The last broad-based rate adjustment plan took effect in early 2008, and critics say many children and adults enrolled in Connecticut’s HUSKY program effectively are uninsured, unable to find doctors willing to accept more Medicaid patients.
Earlier this year, Democratic legislators announced a plan to boost spending on Medicaid rates by $300 million by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Instead, the Appropriations Committee plan hewed closely to the increased spending Lamont proposed in February: adding about $10 million next fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27 for a much more modest, incremental bump.
Exceeding the spending cap for the first time in nearly two decades
Legislators faced many tough choices in this plan — even before cuts in federal aid have been ordered — because of a controversial series of state budget caps that a growing number of Connecticut officials insist need reform.
These “fiscal guardrails,” as supporters call them, have generated annual surpluses of $1.8 billion in their first seven years. Another $1.8 billion cushion is projected for the current year. 
These surpluses represent 8% of the General Fund, and critics say they have leached too many dollars away from education, health care, child care and other core programs.
The Appropriations Committee’s plan hinges on making two key changes to this “guardrails” system.
A program that has barred legislators from spending $1.4 billion in annual income and business tax receipts since 2017 would be scaled back by $300 million, effective immediately. 
And the spending cap that ties budget growth to household income and inflation would be exceeded and reset to allow an extra $131 million in appropriations next fiscal year. That can be done with a three-fifth’s vote in the House and Senate, provided the governor first declares a fiscal emergency in writing.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat who called the spending cap “sacrosanct” during a January meeting with state business leaders, is expected to challenge that aspect of the committee plan.
“My administration has stressed careful spending that can be sustained into the future,” Lamont said shortly after the committee plan was released. “Unfortunately, some portions of this budget proposal include spending that may not be sustainable and could unfortunately result in cuts or tax increases under future state leaders. Connecticut has gone down this road before and the result was financially harmful for taxpayers, municipalities and nonprofits.”
The governor added, “My administration will continue to meet with legislative leaders to find a compromise.”
Lamont wasn’t the only one criticizing the committee plan early Tuesday.
“This is fiscally irresponsible to say the very least,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield.
“The fact that we’re going over the spending cap is definitely an area of concern,” said Rep. Tammy Nuccio of Tolland, ranking House Republican on the Appropriations Committee. 
Legally exceeding the spending cap is far from unprecedented, though it hasn’t happened in a long time.
Unlike the other “fiscal guardrails,” the spending cap has existed in various iterations since 1991, when it was enacted — and later added to the state Constitution — to temper public outrage over creation of a state income tax.
From the late 1990s through 2007, Republican Govs. John G. Rowland and M. Jodi Rell teamed up with Democratic-controlled legislatures to legally exceed the cap seven times.
The last time, in the spring of 2007, Rell and the legislature approved a new biennial budget that exceeded the cap by $690 million in the first fiscal year.
But those cap overruns largely have been criticized by both parties as excessive and irresponsible.
Nuccio also noted the new committee spending plan underfunds a major contractual obligation, heatlh benefits for retired state workers.
Comptroller Sean Scanlon recommended that the committee find another $228 million over the next budget cycle — in addition to what Lamont proposed — to cover this contractual obligation. The comptroller made a similar recommendation to the Lamont administration in December, but the governor didn’t add the money into his February budget plan. 
The committee also ignored this recommendation and, like Lamont, is hoping Scanlon can negotiate savings with the state’s health insurance carrier to at least mitigate this gap.
Delaying raises for most state employees
Because the new Appropriations Committee proposal already exceeds the spending cap for the upcoming fiscal year, the panel assumed raises for most state employees, which are due July 1, would be delayed at least one year.
The governor, who is negotiating with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, has announced no agreement to date.
SEBAC unions have received about 4.5% annual raises — a 2.5% general hike and a step increase that normally is worth another 2 percentage points — for the past four fiscal years. According to nonpartisan analysts, this year’s raises cost the General Fund about $120 million.
If Lamont doesn’t ask lawmakers to ratify a new wage agreement before the regular session ends on June 4, that doesn’t mean workers would forfeit raises. A pay hike eventually ordered for 2025-26 might be delivered late — as has been done on occasion in the past.
Other elements of the Appropriation Committee’s proposal include: 

Adding about $120 million over the next two fiscal years combined to the Department of Correction. State employee unions and many legislators say the department, which spends more on overtime than most agencies, is badly understaffed. The department is projected to overspend its salary account this fiscal year by almost $41 million.


Rejecting Lamont’s call to increase bus fares by 25 cents in 2026-27 and rail fees by 5% in each year of the upcoming biennium. Those changes would generate an extra $35.5 million and are necessary, the administration says, because ridership remains below pre-pandemic levels. 


Adding 53 employees to the Public Defender’s Office and 13 in the Secretary of the State’s Office.

When Gov. JB Pritzker tells audiences how he became interested in politics, it often starts with stories about his mother.

As a child growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, Pritzker often shares, he’d attend marches, rallies and protests with his mother in support of abortion, women’s rights and LGBTQ issues. Those experiences, Pritzker says, set the foundation for many of his progressive beliefs.

“I’m living proof that introducing your kids to the gay agenda might result in them growing up to be governor,” Pritzker told a crowd at a Human Rights Campaign event in Los Angeles in March.

Pritzker has made supporting LGBTQ rights a regular part of his platform as governor, including speaking at dinner events for the HRC and Equality Illinois in recent months. He’s set to speak to the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Sunday – one of the first Democratic presidential primary states.

But some Democrats, who are often named as possible 2028 Democratic presidential candidates alongside Pritzker, think the party needs to talk less about LGBTQ issues such as transgender athletes.

“We weren’t good on the kitchen table issues; we weren’t really good on the family room — the only room we really did well on in the house was the bathroom,” former ambassador to Japan and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on a podcast with California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week. “We not only look like we were on the cultural periphery, we look like that’s what was front and center for us.”

Newsom, who is also a second term governor like Pritzker, ignited a controversy among Democrats earlier this year when, in a separate podcast interview with far-right activist Charlie Kirk, broke from his party and voiced opposition to transgender women competing in women’s sports.

“I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that ... It’s deeply unfair,” Newsom told Kirk.

Speaking in Newsom’s state last month at the HRC event, Pritzker avoided criticizing the California governor, instead focusing on what he describes as the Trump administration’s attack on individual rights. He warned Trump’s executive actions targeting transgender people in the military and in sports could one day lead to orders targeting marriage licenses for same-sex couples.

“I won’t let hope be a blindfold and I won’t continue to advocate that we wage conventional political fights when what we really need is to become street fighters,” Pritzker said in L.A.

The HRC dinner was another example of Pritzker introducing himself to audiences outside Illinois, but he told reporters at a recent news conference in Springfield that people shouldn’t draw conclusions about his remarks.

“I gave a speech about what I believe,” Pritzker said. “It wasn’t aimed at anybody. It wasn’t about creating a lane. These are things that I’ve said here in the state of Illinois. I repeated them in another venue. I’m perfectly happy about that. To the extent that people see it as a lane, that’s their view.”

Pritzker’s views are mainstream in the Democrat Party, University of Illinois Springfield political science professor Jason Pierceson said, who specializes on the politics of gender and sexuality. He said it’s Newsom and Emanuel who are trying to carve a more contrarian lane.

“I think it’s less that Pritzker is carving out a lane than about embracing trans rights and LGBTQ rights,” he said in an interview.

While Pritzker has not joined Newsom and Emanuel’s calls to avoid focusing on transgender issues, he has also suggested that Democrats make economic issues their top priority.

“Here’s where Democrats have to be honest with ourselves: Donald Trump didn’t just ride into power on the backs of oligarchs who wanted tax cuts so badly they were willing to throw a record stock market into the toilet for them,” Pritzker said at an event last month at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C. “No, a number of Americans, 49.8%, went to the ballot box agreeing with Democrat positions on the issues most important to their lives, and they picked the other guy.”

Gallup polling from September 2024 shows the economy was the top issue for voters going into the election, with 52% calling it “extremely important.” At the bottom of the 22 issues polled: transgender rights, with 18% of voters calling it “extremely important” and 36% saying it was “not important.”

“There’s a lot of intensity by activists, particularly on the right against trans rights, but I’m not sure that translates into votes for the median voter or the independent voter,” Pierceson said.

Pierceson said transgender rights get a lot of attention in campaigns, but voters aren’t making final decisions based only on the issue. That could mean Newsom and Emanuel are calling for an overcorrection to the Democrat platform.

“There’s a tendency I think in the professional political class to overestimate the conservatism of voters and to always argue that the most conversative position will be the most politically potent and powerful position,” Pierceson said.

Pritzker was confronted with polling data on LGBTQ issues during his first FOX News interview as governor earlier this month. The March FOX News poll showed 68% of respondents favor President Donald Trump’s executive order attempting to ban transgender women from women’s sports, and 54% support federal policy that recognizes only two genders. Pritzker brushed aside the poll.

“You can go issue by issue and you can ask a question whether people support this issue or that,” he told the FOX News host. “Here’s what people really care about: They care about their health care, they care about their affordability, they care about the kitchen table issues that really matter every day.”

Asked by a reporter last week about his response on FOX News, Pritzker said, “We’ve got to stand up for people’s civil rights. It is vile and inhumane to go after the smallest minority and attack them as if it’s something that is OK in this country.” But he pivoted back to Trump’s tariff policy and said affordability issues “are the ones that affect them in their homes every day.”

Pierceson said it’s too soon to know what the top issues in the next two election cycles will be, but the economy will likely be one of them. He also said rather than abandon LGBTQ issues in campaigns, Democrats should reframe the issue of transgender rights, adding he doesn’t expect most of the party to follow Newsom’s and Emanuel’s position.

“I think one of the things moving forward to think about is can Democrats move away from the athletic issue to a broader narrative about discrimination and maltreatment that maybe ties into some immigration issues and other arbitrary decisions made by the Trump administration,” Pierceson said.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kathy Keck and Jacob Perron carried with them one large photograph and many memories of the late Mireya Keck, a child adopted into the family after suffering a brain injury when aggressively shaken at 7 weeks of age.
Keck spoke of Mireya while her sibling, Perron, held an image capturing a moment when brother and sister shared a laugh. The occasion was made possible, in large measure, by Mireya’s eligibility for Medicaid benefits that provided nursing services so she could live a life not available to her in an institutional hospital, Keck said. She died Jan. 30 2024, in hospice at home south of Topeka.
“Without Medicaid,” Keck said, “we wouldn’t have been able to keep Mireya living in a home where she was loved. She knew love and she knew great joy.”
Keck and Perron, who suffered a brain injury at birth that led to cerebral palsy and other disabilities, took part Monday evening in Medicaid forum with a couple dozen other people at the Topeka & Shawnee County Public Library. The event provided a forum to share thoughts about the value of Medicaid to people with disabilities, seniors in nursing homes or who get care at home, pregnant women or low-income youth in Kansas.
The event offered folks with personal insight into Medicaid the opportunity to speak to others with knowledge of how the national health program influenced quality of life.
But the ultimate audience was limited to six individuals — U.S. Reps. Sharice Davids, Traci Mann, Ron Estes and Derek Schmidt and U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall of Kansas. These elected politicians working in the U.S. Capitol could eventually be asked to vote on federal legislation — details aren’t publicly available — that slashed federal Medicaid spending over the next 10 years.
“This is not right or left. This is truly a human right,” Keck said. “Yes, we want to get rid of fraud. People using the support, that’s not fraud. That’s called helping people live their best life in the most respectful and dignified way possible.”
 
The budget knife
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program serving about 72 million Americans and 425,000 Kansans with limited income and resources. Forty states and the District of Columbia, but not Kansas, expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act to include lower-income adults.
In Washington, a U.S. House committee with oversight of Medicaid has been assigned the task of finding $880 billion in savings over the next decade. Medicaid funding flows directly to states, so reductions in federal appropriations for Medicaid would take the form of cuts to state budgets.
Ben Sommers, professor of health care economics at Harvard University and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said during an online briefing for reporters that most federal lawmakers, whether Republican or Democrat, were worried about how deep cuts to Medicaid would resonate among their constituents.
He said profound reductions could negatively impact hospitals reliant on Medicaid funding and other health care providers engaged in delivering Medicaid services. Eight rural hospitals in Kansas shut down in-patient services since 2015, Medicaid advocates said, and Kansas had more rural hospitals at risk of closing than any state of comparable size.
“Right now, we have big numbers to target,” Sommers said the $880 billion, 10-year objective. “We don’t have a lot of explanation of where that money comes from. That’s all kind of behind closed doors.”
Political rhetoric from House and Senate members keen to cut federal spending was often linked to the goal of addressing government waste, fraud and abuse.
“There is simply no way to get to a number that big through waste, fraud and abuse. There isn’t enough fat to cut from Medicaid to get there,” he said.
Sommers said it was important to acknowledge motivation to gut spending on Medicaid was to sustain tax breaks endorsed by President Donald Trump and “heavily skewed towards higher-income individuals.”
Adrianna McIntyre, assistant professor of health policy and politics at Harvard’s School of Public Health, said during the briefing there was genuine appetite among conservative Republicans in Congress to shrink spending on Medicaid. Implications of Medicaid adjustments for governors on both sides of the partisan aisle could be profound, she said.
“There are definite concerns among governors about sudden changes in Medicaid funding and what it could mean to hospitals and other providers for many low-income people to suddenly find themselves uninsured,” she said. “Generally speaking, if you’re saving money, it’s coming from fewer people having benefits.”
If federal aid was withdrawn, she said, state lawmakers would have the option of reducing the number of people enrolled in Medicaid or to fill the funding gap by raising taxes or slashing spending elsewhere.
 
Personal stakes
Lisa Collette, mother of a nonverbal child who qualified for Medicaid, took the opportunity to share her thoughts during the forum hosted by the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas.
Collette said it would be wrong to carve away an essential health programs because of the high human cost inherent in those budget decisions. Her daughter has a rare syndrome often linked to deafness and blindness, and she receives home nursing care through Medicaid.
“I strongly oppose these cuts because they affect the most vulnerable in our society — the elderly, low-income children and those with disabilities,” Collette said. “As a taxpayer, it’s frustrating to see that programs that benefit the most vulnerable are always No. 1 on the chopping block.”
Julie Avard, of Topeka, said her experience with dementia illustrated the value of Medicaid to families otherwise faced with personal economic ruin or uprooting of their work lives to care for someone no longer capable of doing that alone.
“Who is taking care of a loved one who has dementia or who is aging?” she said. “It gets harder and harder to take care of or to keep the person safe. Without Medicaid, we would be up the proverbial creek without a paddle.”
Rebecca Schultz, a former special education teacher from Leawood, said the electric wheelchair she relied on to be active and to participate in volunteer work or public advocacy cost $25,000. She’s not enrolled in Medicaid, but she said there was no avoiding the harmful outcomes if Congress reduced investment in Medicaid so people with disabilities have fewer support services.
“I’m fortunate. I’ve had a lot of supports in my life,” she said. “For the people that need it, let’s be human beings.”
The debate about Medicaid cuts were disturbing, said Topekan Elvera Johnson, who lives on Social Security income with her husband.
“This is not the time to recklessly cut Medicaid,” said Johnson, who suggested politicians look the example of others. “All people should have access to good medical care. It should be a given. Jesus helped people who needed help. He was a healer.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Perron-Keck-and-Mireya-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 15:08:12.852101

July 3, 2024. (Courtesy of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana campaign)GRAND ISLAND, Neb. — The District Court of Hall County decided Tuesday to allow criminal charges against a notary public for “official misconduct” to proceed, overturning a lower court decision.
District Judge Andrew Butler, in a 10-page opinion, reversed a previous motion to quash against 24 counts of “official misconduct” — a Class II misdemeanor — against Jacy Todd of York, who was a notary for the successful ballot measures to legalize and regulate medical cannabis last year. Todd is believed to be the first notary criminally charged in this way.
Todd is accused of allegedly notarizing petition pages outside the presence of a petition circulator, Michael Egbert of Grand Island, on 24 different dates, each leading to a separate criminal charge. Todd has repeatedly denied all allegations.
Egbert admitted to using a phone book to illegally add voters to petition pages. He accepted a plea deal, reducing a Class IV felony charge to a Class I misdemeanor and $250 fine. Egbert said during a Lancaster County trial against the ballot measures that he has a mental condition that affects his memory.

Butler said he had to view the appeal from Hall County Attorney Marty Klein, who is working with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office in the case, “in the light most favorable” to the State of Nebraska because Todd and his attorney have motioned to end the case. 
More facts are needed, Butler argued, and the “extreme outcome” of a motion to quash should be “rare.”
“Granting the motion to quash was not appropriate at that time when considering the facts most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Butler wrote. “Further, and most importantly to the court, a notary public is a public servant that is subject to civil penalties and criminal penalties if warranted.”
‘Integrity of our elections’
In a statement, the AG’s Office expressed gratitude for Butler’s decision.
“Notaries are public officials who play an important role in our election process to ensure that the integrity of our elections are secured,” spokesperson Suzanne Gage said in a statement.
As the AG’s Office considered an appeal late last year, attorney Mark Porto representing Todd said that “a series of politically orchestrated (and false) Class II misdemeanors are among the least scary and intimidating things” that Todd, a veteran, had ever seen. 
Porto did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment.
Public servant or public duties?
Hall County Judge Alfred Corey in November ruled that notary publics were not public officials and agreed with the “motion to quash” from Todd and his attorney, Mark Porto.
Corey said that while important, notarial duties “hardly implicate responsibilities that go to the heart of representative government” and were “essentially clerical and ministerial.”

Butler said he did not see a distinction between different definitions of “public servant” across state laws and that notaries are “officers” who are appointed by the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office to hold office.
“This language clearly shows that a notary public is a public servant as an officer,” Butler wrote.
‘Voice of its residents’
Butler questioned the extent of resources being used to pursue such criminal charges and the number of such charges “when looking at the current climate of the state and voice of its residents.” 
Nearly 71% of voters voted to legalize medical cannabis, and about 67% to regulate it.
“However, those decisions are left to another entity,” Butler wrote. “The court simply is tasked with applying the laws as written and, in this matter, the motion to quash should have been denied and the matter considered by a finder(s) of fact.”
The case returns to Hall County Court, unless appealed up to the Nebraska Court of Appeals.

(Photo: John Partipilo)The Tennessee Ethics Commission on Tuesday unanimously threw out a complaint against a Montgomery County Republican representative and admonished those who filed it after determining that the commission lacked authority to consider the case.
The complaint, filed April 3 by a group of current and former educators in Montgomery County, said Clarksville Republican Rep. Aron Maberry’s actions as a state representative violated his oath as a sitting Clarksville Montgomery County School Board member. 
The complaint cites Maberry’s vote in favor of House Bill 793 — which would allow school districts and charter schools to refuse to enroll students without permanent legal documentation — as a breach of his “duty to provide equal education opportunities and to refrain from using his position for partisan gain.”
The measure itself is on hold over concerns that its contradiction of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1982 Plyler v. Doe ruling guaranteeing all children access to public education could result in Tennessee schools losing federal funding.

In an expedited hearing Tuesday morning, Commission Chair Tammy White said she was “extremely disturbed” that the press obtained copies of the complaint before it was filed with the commission. She also warned the complainants that filing “unsubstantiated complaints” could result in civil penalties against them.
“This body was not created to be used as a political pawn for headlines,” White said. “There should be serious repercussions for those who act in such a manner as this. And while I do applaud everyone’s political involvement and passion, matters like today should and can be resolved at the local ballot box.”
Tuesday’s special-called hearing, which would typically be confidential, was open to the public at Maberry’s request. The committee’s next regularly scheduled meeting is in August, which the commission deemed too far in the future to allow a complaint of this nature to go undecided.
Bill Young, the commission’s executive director, characterized the complaints as “policy disagreements” and said staff determined that the commission did not have jurisdiction to decide qualifications for office or compliance with the ethics codes of local bodies. The constitutionality of policy is litigated in court, he said.
The Tennessee constitution does not prohibit individuals from serving as both a state representative and a school board member.
Commission threatens action against complainants
Commission Secretary Duane Gilbert said the complaint was a “colossal waste of time, the state’s resources and employees.”
The commission considered calling for a show-cause hearing to determine whether the complainants should be penalized for filing the complaint, but ultimately decided against it.
White and Commission member Stacey Floyd-Thomas said they did not want this complaint to set a precedent for others. 
“Any further action in this manner would necessitate a show-cause hearing” where the complainants would be asked to show why their actions should not be considered reckless disregard, Floyd-Thomas said.
Joy Rice, a member of the group that filed the complaint, said she was “shocked” at the commission’s response.
“I didn’t realize I would have to bring an attorney with me to an ethics complaint,” she said. “I think … it’s a bullying tactic to make sure that nobody else complains.”
Rice said the complaint was not based on Maberry serving in two seats, but rather that “what he’s doing in one seat affects the other one.”
“He took an oath for the Code of Ethics in the school board capacity to represent all children, and then he went to the state and immediately … attempted to pass legislation that went in direct violation of that,” Rice said.
Karen Reynolds, who also signed the complaint, said she was encouraged by a school board member to file the ethics complaint with the state because the school board lacks a formal ethics complaint policy.
“That’s a lot of bullying up there, considering that basically they said they didn’t have jurisdiction,” Reynolds said. “We knew we would hit that wall, but I guess we didn’t expect — basically they tried to silence us by saying, get a lawyer or shut up.”

Maberry, who was also present at the hearing, said he was grateful for the commission’s decision on what he says is a “partisan attack” against him led by someone who he believes is “trying to stay politically relevant in the community.”
Reynolds, a Democrat, ran for the District 22 Tennessee Senate seat in 2024 but lost to Republican Bill Powers.
“Education and protecting CMCSS was the core reason that I ran for state senate, so I’m still going to stand up and do what I think is right for our schools and our children and our community,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds and Rice said their group will consider other paths available to them to pursue the complaint.
Maberry said every decision he’s made on the school board is “to better our public schools,” and his constituents at the state level voted him into office knowing that he intended to keep his school board seat. He does not plan to resign from the school board.
“I believe the message was sent clearly to Tennessee that if you’re going to come after somebody that’s duly elected and make up complaints against them, that you yourself need to make sure that it’s an actual complaint, because you could be breaking state law,” he said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NEW-LEGISLATORS035-683x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-22 14:21:08.445122

Nebraska is marching toward becoming the fourth state to implement a ban on lab-grown meat. Mississippi was the third state to outlaw cell-derived meat. Florida and Alabama have banned cultivating and selling meat grown in laboratories in recent years.
The proposed law doesn’t ban alternative-meat products like the Impossible Burger, which is made entirely from plants. The target is cell-derived meat produced from animal cells, enabling the cells to multiply and differentiate into muscle, fat, and connective tissue without slaughtering animals. The bill would ban the production, import, distribution, promotion, display or sale of any cultivated-protein food in the state.

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln proposed an amendment to the bill that would have replaced the ban with labeling of lab-grown meat — a proposal supported by the Nebraska Farm Bureau. 
“I believe that’s a better, more thoughtful approach that’s in line with agricultural leadership thinking on this topic,” Conrad said.  “I think a ban is too restrictive.” 
The amendment failed with a 12-24 vote. 
Nebraska is the second-largest cattle-producing state in the U.S., behind only Texas. Cattle and other livestock production are among Nebraska’s largest industries, bringing nearly $31.6 billion to the state, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. The Food and Drug Administration approved lab-grown meat for human consumption in 2022. 
“I believe it will only add to the arsenal group of individuals who want to engineer our dietary choices,” DeKay said in support of his proposed ban, “increasing pressures to legally, culturally deny real meat out of animal welfare activists.” 
Conrad questioned the DeKay claims of negative effects. Democratic aligned lawmakers said labeling is a better option because it is a more free-market approach. Rural State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner preferred the labeling approach. 
“Because cattle is [Nebraska’s] number one industry,” Ibach said. “I will do everything to protect that. Banning it is not a bad thing.”
Ibach said she is fine with either approach and was marked “present not voting” for Conrad’s amendment.
 ‘Bioreactor meat’ 

California-based UPSIDE Foods, which sells lab-grown meat, sued the state of Florida for its ban on cell-derived meat last year. While a district court judge rejected Upside Foods’s request for a preliminary injunction, the lawsuit is still ongoing. 
Uma Valeti, CEO and founder of UPSIDE Foods, said he recently met with Gov. Jim Pillen about the potential ban and called it a productive conversation.
“There’s a lot of misinformation about cultivated meat,” Valeti said. “Banning cultivated meat won’t protect farmers; it will only limit Nebraska’s ability to lead, grow its meat production capacity, and weaken its food system.”
DeKay’s bill was introduced at the request of Pillen, who owns a major hog operation based in Columbus. Pillen has called the creation of “bioreactor meat” a “dishonest attack” on producers in Nebraska. 
The Nebraska Farm Bureau supported legislation that would label lab-grown meat but not ban it, saying the bureau supports a free and open market and believes that there is a much better option than a ban. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha supported Conrad’s failed amendment. He said he and the Farm Bureau often disagree on issues. 
“If the (Farm) bureau and I are on the same side of something, that’s certainly something people should take seriously,” Cavanaugh said.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The federal government is blaming a U.S. citizen for his arrest during a traffic stop in Leon County last week under a temporarily blocked state immigration law.
A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security said Monday that Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, was detained Wednesday after he told a Florida Highway Patrol trooper that he was in the country illegally.
“Immediately after learning the individual was a United States citizen, he was released,” a DHS senior official said in a statement Monday. “When individuals admit to committing a crime, like entering the country illegally, they will of course be detained while officers investigate.”
The trooper charged Lopez-Gomez following a traffic stop with illegally entering the state as an “unauthorized alien,” under a new state law that a federal judge temporarily suspended on April 4. Lopez-Gomez, released from Leon County jail Thursday evening, insists he told the trooper he was a U.S. citizen born in Georgia, handed over his Social Security card and Georgia ID, which meets federal security standards under the REAL ID Act of 2005.
The case garnered national attention following Florida Phoenix’s reporting on Thursday.
 Differing accounts

The arrest report states that Lopez-Gomez said he was in the country illegally and had entered Florida illegally, but turned over his ID. However, the arrest report doesn’t mention the Social Security card. The trooper stopped the car Wednesday morning because the driver was going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the report. Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in the car with two others on his way to a flooring job from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.
Amilcar Sales-Lopez, a family member of the driver and boss of the crew, said he arrived at the scene on U.S. Highway 319 because the men called him as they were getting pulled over. Sales-Lopez told the two troopers that Lopez-Gomez was a U.S. citizen, but first had to hand over his Florida driver’s license, he said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“He said I had to verify who I was or that they would arrest me,” Sales-Lopez said in Spanish.
“They wanted to intimidate me,” he added.
The arrest report doesn’t mention that Sales-Lopez was present during the arrest.
The 20-year-old’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, his mother told the Phoenix. He lived in Mexico from the time he was 1-year-old until four years ago, when he returned to Georgia.
The Phoenix has requested video footage of the arrest from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. A spokesperson from the department repeated in a statement to the Phoenix Friday that Lopez-Gomez had stated he was in the country illegally and that he had a federal detainer issued on him.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer asking the jail to hold Lopez-Gomez for 48 hours after his arrest. A Leon County judge cited the ICE hold as the reason she lacked jurisdiction to release Lopez-Gomez, even though she found no probable cause for the arrest after inspecting the Georgia birth certificate and Social Security card his mom brought to court.
The ICE hold states that DHS determined Lopez-Gomez could be deported based on biometric confirmation of his identity and his statements to an immigration officer or “reliable evidence.”
DHS did not respond when the Phoenix asked whether the arresting trooper had federal authorization to act as an immigration official. Approximately 1,400 troopers have completed 40 hours of training to question and arrest people they suspect are in the country without authorization.
Although Attorney General James Uthmeier argues the federal prohibition on enforcement of the law, SB 4C, doesn’t apply to law enforcement, he sent a memo Friday to FHP, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, police chiefs, and sheriffs stating that they shouldn’t arrest or detain anyone under the suspended law.
U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams extended her prohibition on the enforcement of Florida’s immigration law until April 29.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Both chambers of the Maine Legislature cast initial votes to pass legislation that would increase funding for sexual and reproductive health care services. 
The House voted 78-66 on Tuesday after the Senate passed the measure 21-13 on Thursday. However, enactment votes must still occur in both chambers and the bill needs to secure funding, which is tight this session as the state faces a substantial budget deficit.
The bill, LD 143, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Teresa Pierce and nine Democratic co-sponsors, including both presiding officers, would provide an annual allocation of $6.18 million for what are considered family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. 
These funds would be in addition to the baseline $978,000 the state annually provides for family planning, which providers argue has been stagnant for a decade and is no longer adequate to meet needs.
Reproductive health providers call for more state funding as federal threats loom

Such funding is not used for abortions, though several people who submitted testimony against LD 143 falsely claimed the bill would fund the procedure, as did several lawmakers on the House floor on Thursday. 
Rep. Kathy Irene Javner (R-Chester) and Rep. Marygrace Caroline Cimino (R-Bridgton) requested on the House floor that the bill explicitly state the funds won’t be used for abortion. Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) said, “this bill comes as close to money laundering as I’ve ever seen,” claiming that the funding could possibly be used by healthcare providers for things such as spending in elections. 
“We can say categorically that these dollars are not used to support the provision of abortion care services, nor are they used to support political campaigns,” George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, the statewide grantee for both federal and state family planning dollars, told Maine Morning Star after the comments on the House floor. 
Maine Family Planning and its sub-grantees, including Planned Parenthood, are subject to regular federal audits. 
“Not once in our 50+ years as the statewide grantee have we been found to be non-compliant on either of these baseless claims,” Hill said. 
Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund, similarly told Maine Morning Star after the representatives’ comments that providers have robust systems for accounting and auditing to ensure compliance with all requirements of federal and state laws. 
“It’s unfortunate that we have elected leaders sowing confusion about this bill and what it would fund,” Margulies said.

Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the clinical side of operations, and the Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund PAC, which spends in elections, are also separate organizations, Margulies clarified. 
“The very reason that organization exists,” Margulies said referring to the PAC, “is because of the political attacks we face constantly in providing clinical care to patients through Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.” 
On the House floor, Javner and House Assistant Minority Leader Katrina Smith (R-Palermo) argued the funding should instead go toward labor and delivery units in Maine. Several maternity units have closed in recent weeks, in rural areas in particular, though their leadership have cited low birth rates rather than a lack of funding. 
The legislation ultimately secured the support of the Democratic majority on Tuesday, with some members of that caucus sharing personal stories to illustrate the broad array of services that constitute family planning. 
Rep. Cassie Lynn Julia (D-Waterville) said she was diagnosed with cancer at 18 years old at a center funded by family planning dollars. 
“If I didn’t have access to Waterville family planning when I was growing up as the child of a single dad, I probably wouldn’t be here,” Julia said. 
Providers say Trump Title X freeze will have devastating impact on tens of thousands of Mainers

Providers say the state funding increase is also crucial in light of President Donald Trump withholding federal funds to health care providers under what’s known as Title X, the country’s only federally funded program that supports family planning services. Providers in the Title X network have never been able to use the funds for abortion services, however those who offer such services are eligible to receive and use the funds for family planning services. 
Providers also pointed to possible cuts to Medicaid in the congressional budget plan when emphasizing the importance of state support. 
Maine Family Planning and its subgrantees serve roughly 31,000 patients across the state each year and more than 70% qualified for free or reduced-cost care in 2023. 
Last year, 47% of the patients served by Maine Family Planning were enrolled in MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, which is a joint federal-state program that helps cover medical costs for some people with limited incomes. 
This is not the first time providers and lawmakers have sought an increase in state family planning funding, though they’re upping their ask this year. 
Last session, Pierce sought a nearly $3.4 million increase. While that bill received initial support from both chambers and was approved to receive funding by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, it ultimately failed because it wasn’t taken up for final enactment votes before session ended. 
LD 143 still needs to clear the hurdles that held up the legislation last year, all within a much tighter budget year. 
“While there’s a ton of budget priorities and there’s a lot of important things to fund, it is absolutely essential that we keep reproductive health care available to Mainers,” Margulies said.

(Will Steinfeld/Rhode Island Current)Funeral arrangements for the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio were announced Tuesday morning, with a Mass in Ruggerio’s name planned for Monday, April 28, at 11 a.m. at St. Anthony Church in North Providence.
Calling hours will be held Sunday from 3 to 8 p.m., and again Monday from 8:30 to 10 a.m. at Maceroni Funeral Home in Providence.
Ruggerio died Monday morning following a yearslong battle with cancer. He was 76.
A North Providence Democrat, Ruggerio was the longest-serving member of the Rhode Island General Assembly, including four decades in the upper chamber. Condolences and praise for his legacy and leadership has poured in from state and federal officials, local union organizers and advocacy groups.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives will honor Ruggerio with a moment of silence, followed by a prayer, when it meets at 4 p.m. today, Larry Berman, a House spokesperson, confirmed via email. 
A resolution in Ruggerio’s memory will also be introduced in the House, followed by tributes from House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Rep. Arthur Corvese, also a North Providence Democrat and a “very close friend” of Ruggerio, Berman said.
The Rhode Island Senate has canceled all sessions and committee hearings until after Ruggerio’s funeral. When the remaining 37 senators meet again, their first task will be to elect a new president. 
At least three senators — Sen. Ryan Pearson, Sen. Frank Ciccone III and Senate Majority Leader Val Lawson — are believed to be vying for the president spot, though none have publicly confirmed their intentions.
On Monday, Lawson walked away when asked at the conclusion of a State House briefing about the forthcoming president election. Ciccone has not returned multiple calls for comment. Pearson, who served as majority leader until he was ousted by Ruggerio last year following a feud between the two, declined to comment Monday on the election.
Gov. Dan McKee has ordered flags at state buildings and facilities fly at half staff until Ruggerio’s internment.

Glenn Youngkin. (Photo courtesy of John Reid)The Republican ticket for Virginia’s 2025 statewide elections is now locked in, after longtime Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity announced Monday that he is withdrawing from the lieutenant governor’s race due to lingering health complications following heart surgery.
That clears the path for conservative radio show host John Reid of Richmond to become the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor — joining Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is now her party’s default nominee for governor after two challengers failed to qualify for the ballot, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection unopposed within the party.
Reid brings a long resume in Republican politics and communications to the ticket. He has served as vice chair of the Henrico County GOP Committee, was elected an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2020, and a full delegate last year. He is also the founder and chair of the Virginia Council, a group of educators and activists focused on preserving the state’s cultural heritage. 
Reid previously worked as director of editorial communications for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and as Senate communications director for former U.S. Sen. George Allen, R-Va. Earlier in his career, he served as president of the bipartisan U.S. Senate Press Secretaries Association and had the distinction of being one of the last interns to President Ronald Reagan. 
On Monday, Reid offered praise for Herrity and struck a unifying tone as the GOP closed ranks around its 2025 ticket.
“Pat has been a gentleman during this campaign and he has devoted many years of his life to serving the people of Fairfax and of Virginia,” he said in a statement. “We all owe a debt of gratitude to responsible men and women who step forward into the arena, sacrificing their time and often personal lives to offer leadership.”
Reid called Herrity’s decision to end his campaign “selfless” and said it provides the Republican Party with an early chance to rally around a full statewide slate. Positioning himself as a candidate focused on broad appeal, Reid said he’s prepared to carry the GOP banner across the state. 
“As I hope my travels across the state and work ethic have demonstrated, I take my new responsibility as the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor seriously. I will continue to work hard to be worthy of this opportunity and to earn every vote of Republicans, Democrats, and all those looking for a voice across Virginia.”
Herrity said in a lengthy statement that he made the decision “with a very heavy heart,” noting that while his doctors still expect a full recovery, complications from his March 13 open-heart surgery have made it clear that returning to the campaign trail at full strength won’t be possible in the near future. 
“Unfortunately, the 150 percent effort required for a statewide campaign would also significantly delay my recovery, put undue stress on my health and come with some risk,” he wrote.
The sole Republican on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and the only GOP candidate from vote-rich Northern Virginia in the statewide field, Herrity had been off the trail for weeks but still led all candidates — Republicans and Democrats alike — in first-quarter fundraising for the office of lieutenant governor, pulling in $540,000. 
That put him ahead of former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney ($429,000), state Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, and physician Babur Lateef, both of whom raised just under $400,000. Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, raised $306,000, followed by former U.S. Department of Justice counsel Victor Salgado at $134,000.
Herrity’s exit leaves Reid as the lone Republican for the job, avoiding a divisive primary fight and allowing the GOP to fully consolidate its resources toward November. 
He also used the moment to urge continued support for the Republican slate, calling Earle-Sears “critical” to preserving what he described as Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s legacy. 
“If not, Virginia will lose its competitive edge with forced unionization, our neighborhoods will be less safe, education standards will again be lowered, California will determine what cars we drive and electricity will continue to be both more expensive and less reliable.”
Earle-Sears congratulated Reid on X, saying, “With Jason Miyares and our team, we’ll continue building on the meaningful results of the Youngkin-Sears Administration — making Virginia safer, stronger, more affordable, and with more opportunity than ever before.”
Democratic candidates were quick to offer words of support for Herrity’s recovery, even as they prepare for what promises to be a fierce primary battle.
“Wishing (Pat Herrity) strength and healing as he steps back from the LG race,” Rouse posted on X. “Praying for a full recovery for him and his family.”
Stoney added: “I am sending my best wishes for a speedy recovery to Pat Herrity. Brandy and I are thinking about you and your family during this time.”
Lateef struck a more pointed tone in his response, saying he hoped Herrity makes a full recovery and that he would be ready to take on Reid, “flip the lieutenant governorship, help win the governor’s and attorney general’s races, and expand the Democratic majority in the House of Delegates.”
Democrats have already secured their nominee for governor — former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger was unchallenged for the party’s top spot. But the battles for lieutenant governor and attorney general remain crowded and costly.
Former Del. Jay Jones of Norfolk is attempting a political comeback in the attorney general’s race after his 2021 primary loss. He faces Henrico Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Both are currently lagging behind Miyares in fundraising. Miyares raised $1.5 million in the first quarter, compared to $931,000 for Jones and $534,000 for Taylor.
Political observers say Herrity’s exit reshapes the dynamics for both parties.
“With the GOP slate now settled with Earle-Sears, Miyares and Reid, it gives the GOP some room to launch a coordinated campaign,” said David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg. “Money they would have spent in a primary now can be spent in the general election.”
Richards noted the ticket’s diversity could be a strategic advantage for Republicans but warned of its ideological branding. “It is also a diverse ticket, which will be a selling point, but also a very pro-Trump, far-right ticket, which will be a difficult sell in much of Virginia.”
Democrats, meanwhile, are facing a double-edged sword. 
“That means spending money now and having less later,” Richards said. “On the positive side it means that the Democrats get a lot more attention as primary season rolls around in June, while the GOP gets sidelined until later in the summer when the regular election campaign season starts.”
Despite stepping back from the statewide race, Herrity said he remains committed to his role on the Fairfax Board of Supervisors and to helping Republicans in November. 
“My campaign was less about me and the lieutenant governor position and more about doing well in Northern Virginia so we could elect Winsome Sears as our governor and reelect Attorney General Jason Miyares,” he wrote. “I remain committed to the mission.”
Youngkin offered his support late Monday.
“After making a difficult decision today, Pat Herrity — one of Virginia’s strongest leaders — is in our prayers for strength and a full recovery. We’ll continue to fight alongside him as the best supervisor in Fairfax County,” he said. 
And while his recovery may be slower than expected, Herrity insisted he’s not down and out. 
“I can assure you that I did not have a stroke or heart attack and I am walking over three miles a day and climbing stairs.”

Members of a Senate spending panel on Tuesday agreed that there should be more oversight over the state program that pays health care costs for the poor, elderly, and disabled and passed SB 1060.
The bill, which heads to the full Senate next, establishes a Joint Legislative Committee on Medicaid Oversight to ensure transparency in the state’s Medicaid program, mostly administered through contracts with managed care plans.
It would require the Agency for Health Care Administration (AFCA) , which houses the Medicaid program and is charged with oversight, to by July 1 enter into a contract with the the state auditor general to maintain a data-sharing agreement. The auditor general is directed to assist the committee in its work.
With time ticking on the 2025 regular session, it’s not clear whether the bill will make it through the process, though. That’s because the House counterpart, HB 935, has yet to be heard in a committee.
Double checking AHCA
Sen. Jason Brodeur said he filed the bill because AHCA increased Medicaid reimbursement rates by $100 million over the amount that the Legislature appropriated in state fiscal year 23-24 to pay the plans. The agency, he said, held authority to increase the rates because Florida law authorizes agencies to make adjustments within 5%.
“So, this bill simply says we’re creating a joint committee with our own actuary. So that should we get those kinds of bills presented to us, we have our own folks we can ask to say, ‘Is this right?’ It may be. Probably is. But if we’re going to be spending that kind of money on a program this big, I’d like to have somebody who works for us tell us that’s the right number.”
The bill comes amid a whirlwind of controversy surrounding AHCA, its role in a Medicaid settlement with health care giant Centene that directed $10 million to Hope Florida Foundation, and the foundation’s contributions to political committees fighting a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana.
Health care giant Centene writes a $10M check to Hope Florida Foundation

Hope Florida Foundation meeting includes warning on tax status

The growing controversy, first reported by The Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald, has dominated the 2025 session and played a role in the Senate’s decision this week to not confirm two of Gov. Ron DeSantis’s choices to run large state agencies: Shevaun Harris as secretary of AHCA and Taylor Hatch as secretary of the Department of Children and Families.
Touching on the Hope Florida controversy, Sen. Jason Pizzo asked Brodeur whether the new joint committee would have authority over pre-suit settlements.
“I do not know,” Brodeur replied.
Pizzo followed, “Would you be amenable to taking a look as to whether or not the oversight board would be able to monitor pre-suit settlements of Medicaid overpayments?”
Brodeur said he would.
“It sounds reasonable to me, because the entire point of this is oversight to begin with. So whatever oversight that looks like, it should be comprehensive,” Brodeur said.

Two Habitat chapters in the state have been affected by reductions in the federal AmeriCorps volunteer program this month. Photo by Elodie Reed/Vermont PublicThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.This spring, a dozen young adults from across the country decamped to southwest Vermont to help build sorely-needed new homes. They were beginning their year of community service with a federal volunteer program focused on supporting disaster response and building affordable housing. But last week, the group’s stint volunteering with Bennington County Habitat for Humanity came to an abrupt end. On April 15, the nonprofit received a call from the federal AmeriCorps agency informing them that their crew of volunteers was being “demobilized,” according to the organization’s executive director, Cindy Luce. Early the next morning, the 12 corps members hit the road back to their central campus in Iowa, Luce said. By the end of last week, they were put on planes to their hometowns and notified that their contracts would be terminated at the end of the month, according to Luce.“There was a lot of tears,” Luce said.The Bennington volunteers were just a few of several hundred young service members dismissed in mid-April as a result of the Trump administration’s push to shrink the federal workforce. Roughly 750 members of AmeriCorps’ National Civilian Community Corps program were placed on administrative leave last week, and were told their service terms would terminate at the end of April, according to the New York Times. The move came a day before broader staffing cuts to the independent government agency.Corps members with the NCCC travel to different volunteer sites over a 10-month period while earning a modest stipend. The group serving with Bennington Habitat only had about a week left there before they were scheduled to move onto their next assignment when the termination came, Luce said. Still, the group’s early discharge could set back the nonprofit’s construction schedule. They had been building a home for a single mother and her son, Luce said.“If we don’t get additional help from other volunteers to keep the momentum…it’s going to delay when we sell the house,” she said. “If hers is delayed, the next one is delayed, and then the next one is delayed.” At least one other Habitat chapter in Vermont has been impacted by the AmeriCorps program’s rollback. Central Vermont Habitat for Humanity had been expecting to host a team of volunteers in May and June to help wrap up construction on a duplex in Randolph.But last week, the organization’s director, Zachariah Watson, received an email informing him that AmeriCorps NCCC “is working within new operational parameters that impact the program’s ability to sustain program operations.” All corps members were currently being returned home, the email said, in alignment with the Department of Government Efficiency’s cost-saving priorities.Central Vermont Habitat had planned for the AmeriCorps group to lay down flooring and put up siding at the Randolph home, so the organization could finalize the sale this summer. The loss of the volunteer labor jeopardizes the project’s timeline, Watson said. Any delay could drive up the project’s costs, particularly if the nonprofit ends up needing to buy materials after tariffs kick in.“Most of our lumber and insulation and building materials come from Canada,” Watson said. The nonprofit’s lumber supplier has informed them that they anticipate “at least a 14% increase in lumber and in cellulose” when tariffs go into effect, he said.Aside from Habitat for Humanity, at least one other AmeriCorps group volunteering in Vermont was recalled last week: a team serving with the Federal Emergency Management Agency at their field office in Williston. Crews of service members have been a regular presence there since FEMA stood up the local office in the wake of devastating flooding across Vermont in July of 2023.The current group only had about two weeks remaining at their assignment in Vermont when they were terminated, according to Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer. FEMA is working to close the Williston outpost — a move Farnham described as “relatively routine” at this stage in the state’s recovery process — and the early termination of the AmeriCorps crew will have a “minimal” impact, he said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Habitat for Humanity programs lose AmeriCorps volunteers after federal cuts.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/habitat-house-vermontpublic-elodie-reed-20190917-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Attorney General Liz Murrill wants state lawmakers to pass a new law that would move hundreds of criminal cases with 15- and 16-year-old defendants from juvenile to adult courts every year. 

The request comes a few weeks after Louisiana overwhelmingly voted down a constitutional amendment that could have led to similar teenage transfers in the criminal justice system. 
Murrill included Senate Bill 74, sponsored by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, in her the package of bills she is pushing during the Louisiana Legislature’s 2025 session. As currently written, it would automatically put 15- and 16-year-olds charged with felony crimes who currently go before juvenile justice judges in front of district court judges who typically handle adult defendants. 
In an interview Tuesday, Murrill described the legislation as solely a “venue change,” meaning the teens would still be subjected to juvenile criminal standards and not face lengthier adult prison sentences. 
Opponents said the bill would throw four of the state’s largest court systems – in Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes – into chaos. Those jurisdictions have juvenile courts with judges who solely handle cases involving people under age 17. 
“Children are not simply tiny adults that you can handle in adult criminal court,” said Paul Young, a retired Caddo Parish juvenile court judge who opposes Murrill’s legislation. 
Other parts of the state would also feel the effects of the proposal. In some parts of Louisiana, city and parish courts handle cases with teenagers under 17. Like juvenile courts, their authority over 15- and 16-year-olds facing felony allegations would be transferred to district courts focused on adults if the bill passes. 
Critics say the public sent a clear message on moving minors into the adult criminal justice system in March. That’s when 66% of state voters rejected a constitutional amendment Gov. Jeff Landry backed that could have put 15- and 16-year-olds in adult prisons for a wider range of offenses.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The bill doesn’t go quite as far as the amendment could have. Fifteen- and 16-year-olds would still be subjected to lighter juvenile punishments instead of adult sentences, but the senator’s aim is to put more teenagers in adult courts. 
But Seabaugh said he planned to file his bill before voters rejected the constitutional change. 

“The bill is not a response to the amendment,” he said.

Instead, the legislation is a reaction to frustrations with juvenile court judges in New Orleans, according to Seabaugh and Murrill. They don’t believe those judges are giving out harsh enough sentences, and the gentler approach is contributing to a high crime rate. 
“The juvenile judges, particularly in Orleans Parish, are not doing their job,” Seabaugh said in an interview last week. 

Murrill doubled down on Seabaugh’s concern about juvenile court judges in New Orleans. She said minors in the city are not being held responsible for offenses they commit, 

But the attorney general is also considering ways to soften the proposal with regards to juvenile judges in other parts of the state because, she said, there are those who are “doing a good job.” 
Murrill may ask for an amendment to the legislation to give district attorneys and her office the option to move a felony case involving a 15- or 16-year-old to district court instead of mandating an automatic transfer. The change would help address problems with juvenile court judges in New Orleans, she said, while not yanking cases from other judges who are performing effectively. 
State elected officials like Seabaugh and Murrill, who call for stricter criminal measures, like to emphasize New Orleans public safety challenges, even though the city has seen a dramatic decline in its crime rate over the past two years. 

The New Orleans juvenile court judges also pushed back on Murrill and Seabaugh’s statements about their lack of effectiveness. Intake arrests for New Orleans minors were down by almost a third between 2023 and 2024, according to the New Orleans juvenile judges’ spokeswoman Yolanda Johnson. 

“The Court is perplexed by the inaccuracies being presented that is not supported by data,” Johnson wrote in a prepared statement provided Tuesday. 
There is also broad consensus that rehabilitation provided in the juvenile system – as opposed to punishment provided in adult prisons – is especially effective for teenagers because their brains haven’t fully developed yet. 
“There are tons of studies that show that is the worst thing you can do and all it does is create another generation of criminals,” Jay Dixon, the former state public defender in Louisiana who now works in Massachusetts, said about the plan to put more minors in adult court. 

”It is incredibly stupid and short-sighted,” Dixon said. 
But Seabaugh points out judges already handle criminal cases for minors and adults side by side in Louisiana’s smaller judicial districts. Rural courts, which have as few as two judges, don’t have the luxury of a specialty juvenile court. 
District courts with juvenile sections in Caddo, Orleans, Jefferson and East Baton Rouge parishes are already busy, however, and don’t have the capacity or facilities to take on a large influx of underage defendants, critics say. 
State laws require juvenile cases to be handled on a much faster timeline. Minors have to go to trial within three months of their arrest, whereas adult cases are allowed to languish for over a year, Young said. 

Juvenile cases also require judges to meet in person with minor defendants every six months while they are incarcerated. By contrast, a district court judge often never sees an adult convicted of a crime after their sentencing, Young said.  
District judges in the four parishes with juvenile courts are overwhelmed by their current workloads. Moving several hundred cases onto their dockets would cause severe scheduling challenges, Young said. 

“You can’t hold a child in limbo waiting for trial for upwards of a year or more,” he said.
District judges would also have to close their courtrooms every time they handle a juvenile case. Most hearings for adult defendants are open to the public, but juvenile cases have to be conducted in private. 

Transporting more minors and holding them in the courthouses could also prove difficult. Federal law requires underage people to be driven to court independently of adult defendants. They also have to be kept in separate holding spaces while awaiting their hearings, and some courthouses aren’t equipped to house them independent of adults. 
District attorneys and public defenders might also be forced to hire more staff to cover juvenile cases. 
“From a volume perspective, it’s going to cause issues,” said Michelle AndrePont, who runs the public defender office in Caddo Parish.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5974-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy of CMS)With a Texas court striking down efforts to increase staffing levels in nursing homes, and Congress pushing back against those same efforts, the state of Iowa’s lawsuit to block the new regulations is continuing to move forward.
Last fall, Iowa joined 19 other states, including South Carolina, as well as representatives of the nursing home industry in suing the Biden administration to block the implementation of new staffing requirements for taxpayer-funded nursing homes.
The new standards would eventually require homes to conduct assessments of their residents’ needs, provide 3.48 hours of direct nursing care per resident, per day, and require then to have a registered nurse available 24 hours per day, seven days a week.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, seeks to overturn those requirements, which were approved last year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In their court petition, the 20 states and more than a dozen industry associations argue that the staffing requirements pose “an existential threat to the nursing home industry as many nursing homes that are already struggling will have no choice but to go out of business. And the main victims will be the patients who will have nowhere else to go.”




Nursing home staffing lawsuit
Other plaintiffs in the Iowa-led lawsuit over nursing home staffing include: Nebraska, Kansas, South Carolina, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Co-plaintiffs include the LeadingAge lobbying and professional associations in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Colorado, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Michigan.




 Texas judge says CMS lacks authority

The Iowa lawsuit is nearly identical to a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas where, on April 7, District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk vacated the new requirements.
Kacsmaryk ruled that while the goals of the new rules were “laudable,” they were not consistent with congressionally approved statutes.
“CMS lacks authority to issue a regulation that replaces Congress’s preferred minimum hours with its own. That is exactly what the 24/7 requirement does,” Kacsmaryk stated in his ruling. “Congress took it upon itself to set the minimum hours nursing homes ‘must use the services of a registered professional nurse.’ It set that level at ‘at least eight consecutive hours a day.’ The 24/7 requirement in effect amends the statute because it strikes Congress’s ‘eight,’ and replaces it with the agency’s ’24.’”
The ruling was not unexpected. When the Texas case was filed, consumer groups noted that Kacsmaryk, who was the only judge to whom it could be assigned, had previously presided in multiple health care cases in which he had ruled against government regulators.
In the Iowa case, which remains active, a judge in January denied the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the rule. Three weeks ago, CMS filed a brief in the states’ appeal of that decision — signaling that CMS, at least to a certain extent, still backs the new rule, despite the change in administration that took place in January when Donald Trump took office as president.
On the same day CMS filed its brief with the appeals court, the State of Iowa and its co-plaintiffs filed a brief in the underlying case, arguing that even if CMS had been granted the statutory authority to enact such rules, Congress’ delegation of that authority was unconstitutional. “If that authority justifies the rule, there is no limit on what CMS can do,” the plaintiffs argued. “The rule imposes billions of dollars in costs, overrides state laws, and effectively rewrites other provisions of the Medicaid and Medicare statutes.”
 Congress poised to block rule

Some consumer advocates believe CMS, now headed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is angling for congressional action to block the new rules, so that government savings from repealing them can be used to partially offset a proposed $880 billion cut in the Medicaid budget.
Given that, as well as the potential for an Iowa court ruling that might conflict with that of Kacsmaryk’s decision, industry officials and GOP lawmakers are pushing for CMS to administratively repeal the rule or for Congress to simply block it.
U.S. Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, told industry lobbyists recently that she believed the staffing mandates threatened rural nursing homes, adding that despite the Texas court ruling she would be pursuing “legislation because we need to make sure this rule is overturned.”
Fischbach first introduced the Protecting Rural Seniors Access to Care Act in 2023, shortly after a preliminary version of the rule was proposed by CMS. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa was a co-sponsor of the bill.
Fischbach reintroduced the bill in February of this year. In the Senate, James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, and Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican, have introduced a similar version of the bill.
 Iowa homes cited for lack of staff 

Last year, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported that Iowa nursing homes had compiled the sixth-worst record in the nation for staffing-level violations. Data from CMS showed that 14% of the state’s 422 nursing facilities were cited for insufficient staffing in fiscal year 2023. That was more than double the national average, which was 5.9%.
Report ranks SC worst in the nation in nursing home inspectors

Only five other states — Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico and Oregon — had a worse record of compliance with the sufficient-staffing requirement.
Des Moines’ Fleur Heights care facility compiled Iowa’s worst record of compliance.  Over a nine-month period between May 2023 and February 2024, Fleur Heights was cited, but never fined, five times for insufficient staff — more than any other facility in the state.
Federal data suggest many care facilities already meet the new standards, but industry officials allege nursing homes will need to hire an additional 27,000 full-time registered nurses and 78,000 full-time certified nurse aides, at a cost of more than $7 billion, to meet the requirements.
A report from the Long-Term Care Community Coalition earlier this year showed that 6 in 10 of all U.S. nursing homes would have met the new nurse-staffing standard of 3.48 hours in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The fact that a majority of facilities already meet the new minimum standard while still facing quality-of-care issues has been a concern for many advocates who say the new standards don’t go far enough.
They point to a federal study that shows each resident needs at least 4.1 hours of nursing care each day – a standard met by only 26% of all nursing homes nationally.
A University of Pennsylvania study recently concluded that the new staffing mandates, if left in place, would save roughly 13,000 lives per year. In Iowa alone, the researchers said, the mandates would save 101 to 250 lives per year.

Members at the time, from left, were Jim Martin, Whitney Smith, Robin Wheeler Sanders and Jeremy Schneider. Attorney Scott Pool, the commission's counsel, is at the far right (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Last fall, St. Louis attorney Brad Ketcher read the news that a Republican candidate for the Missouri Senate was using money from his church to help fund his campaign.
As the chief of staff to former Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan in the 1990s, Ketcher helped establish the Missouri Ethics Commission, a state agency that enforces campaign finance and ethics laws. 
He was so “appalled” when the Senate candidate in question won the seat in November that Ketcher filed an ethics complaint asking the commission to investigate.
But in April, he learned his complaint was getting thrown out because there weren’t enough commission members to convene a meeting to review it. 
“Because there were not four commissioners able to consider the investigation within the statutory timeframe, the commission could take no action on this complaint,” the commission said in dismissing the complaint. 
The complaint is among 16 others that have been dismissed in the more than 100 business days since the commission last had enough members to reach a quorum. It’s the second time in less than a year that the commission hasn’t had enough members to enforce state campaign and ethics laws. 
Missouri Ethics Commission finally has a quorum — but still can’t meet or take action

Ketcher refiled the complaint last week in hopes that the governor will fill the commission vacancies. When he served as Carnahan’s right hand, Ketcher said he’d never want to read a headline: “Governor fails to appoint ethics panel.” 
“Do I want that headline?” he said. “Hell no, I don’t want that headline. Even though there’s probably nothing nefarious going on, that’s what it looks like to the rest of the world — like you’re trying to hide something, you’re up to something or trying to protect somebody.”
A spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Kehoe, who was sworn into office in January, did not respond to a request for comment. 
On Jan. 13, former Gov. Mike Parson withdrew two commissioners who he’d appointed months earlier but who had not yet been confirmed by the Missouri Senate. That left only two of the six seats on the commission filled. The last time the commission had enough members to meet was Nov. 20. 
Ketcher said it’s challenging for the ethics commission to get a new governor’s attention in the middle of his first legislative session. 
“I would say it’s probably doubly a challenge for an acting executive director,” Ketcher said. 
Stacey Heislen, acting executive director of the commission, declined to comment. 
State law requires an investigation be completed within 90 business days of a complaint, which is then presented to the commission to determine whether there are reasonable grounds of a violation or whether it should be dismissed. 
However, for campaign-finance complaints 60 days from an election, the investigations must be completed within 15 days. The law also requires at least four commission members for a quorum, and at least four affirmative votes shall be required for any action or recommendation of the commission. 
The state faced the same problem last year for several months, before Parson appointed Jeremy Schneider of Macon in April, Whitney Smith of Des Peres in June and Jim Martin of Perryville in July. 
With Robin Wheeler Sanders serving as the chair since 2022, the commission finally had a quorum after those three appointments. 
However, only Sanders and Schneider remain after Parson withdrew his appointments for Smith and Martin. The law states the vacancies are to be filled within 75 days. 
“State government has made crime fighting a priority, and that should include enforcement of the ethics and nepotism and conflict of interest laws,” Ketcher said, “and they ought to move promptly to get a full commission in place to deal with those important issues.”
Missouri’s governor appoints commission members from nominations received by the congressional districts of the political parties that received the two highest votes for the last gubernatorial election.
Members are prohibited from running for office, making contributions for or against a candidate or issue, working as a lobbyist, for the state or any political subdivision, being an officer of a political party or participating in an election except for voting.
The state Senate must then confirm the appointments. 
For Ketcher’s complaint, he believes the Senate confirmation raises an “interesting” question.
The focus of his complaint is Joe Nicola, a Republican from Grain Valley now serving in the Senate and able to vote on nominees for the ethics commission.
“Let’s assume the governor does appoint some commissioners, is Nicola gonna basically get to vote for or against his jury pool?” Ketcher said. “And I think that will be a moment of truth for the state Senate and for him.”
Nicola told The Independent that Ketcher’s complaint was “ridiculous.”
“My church made donations to a PAC,” Nicola said, but he doesn’t believe it’s against regulations because his church isn’t a registered nonprofit.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ethics-Commission-II-20241016-1024x615.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.
Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”

Cuts to federal resources

In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.

Lawmakers step up

In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.
In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.

With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.

In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

The event will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at 3701 Springer Boulevard, home of the Watershed Human and Community Development Agency, a Black-owned nonprofit that provides job counseling, food assistance and disaster relief, among other things.
The Little Rock Black Nurses Association of Arkansas, the Arkansas Birthing Project and the Arkansas Minority Health Commission will co-host the event with Watershed, according to a Monday news release from LRBNAA and the Birthing Project.
Attendees will be able to receive health screenings from members of the LRBNAA and the Arkansas Medical, Dental and Pharmaceutical Association, and physicians in Little Rock and North Little Rock will accept referrals for follow-up appointments with individuals who do not have primary care physicians, according to the news release.
Roughly 30 vendors will provide “resources and information about pregnancy, general women’s and men’s health, mental health challenges, body mass index, tobacco use and cessation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),” the release states. The event will also sell food and drinks and offer door prizes.
Study: Disparities in Arkansas child health persist, especially for Black families

The Arkansas Birthing Project’s executive director is Zenobia Harris, a registered nurse and an advocate for improving Arkansas’ maternal health landscape for Black mothers. Arkansas’ Black maternal mortality rate more than doubled from 1999 to 2019, according to a 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Earlier this month, Harris expressed support for extending Medicaid coverage for postpartum women to 12 months after giving birth if they do not already qualify for the state’s Medicaid expansion program. A legislative committee voted down the proposed policy, and Arkansas remains the only state without some version of this coverage option.
Arkansas has one of the nation’s highest maternal mortality rates and the third highest infant mortality rate. Maternal mortality is measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Woman-with-newborn-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

That decision goes against what my grandfather — and our nation's founders — stood for.,"Editor’s note: Nina Rifkind is an adjunct professor at the University of Mississippi Law School and the granddaughter of one of the founders of a major national law firm that recently settled a dispute with President Donald Trump. She agreed to write about that settlement and about her grandfather’s story for Mississippi Today Ideas.

Last month, the Trump administration issued an executive order aimed at the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison (known to many as just “Paul, Weiss”).
The order threatened the firm with withdrawal of the security clearances required to do certain legal work as retribution for work Mark Pomerantz, a former Paul, Weiss partner, had done while employed by the Manhattan District Attorney’s office in connection with the investigation of Trump’s businesses. Within days, Paul, Weiss announced that it had struck a deal with the Trump administration, offering, among other things, millions of dollars’ worth of free legal work for administration endorsed causes, and changes in hiring practices in exchange for the dismissal of the executive order.

While I had been angry about many of the acts of this administration that seemed to undermine the very institutions and ideals of American government and society that I had been raised to revere, this one struck particularly close to my heart.
On the one hand, I had no particular interest in the affairs of this law firm, located half a continent away from my home in Mississippi, and to which I had no personal connection except that it was where my grandfather, Simon H. Rifkind, had practiced law until his death at the age of 94 in 1995. On the other hand, it seemed to me that the executive orders addressed to this law firm, and, ultimately, a handful of others, were an assault on my chosen profession, on our legal system and on our democracy as a whole.
So when the chairman of the firm Brad Karp, in defense of the decision to make a deal, cited the firm’s “Statement of Firm Principles,” written by my grandfather in 1963, I contacted my sister, Amy Rifkind, a lawyer practicing in Washington, D.C. We quickly decided to speak out. We did so in the form of a letter to Mr. Karp, explaining that his decision was an affront to those very principles he claimed to defend.
In that letter, we wrote that our grandfather believed that to practice law in this country is a privilege that comes with “responsibilities both to our profession and our country” and a duty “to protect ‘the prizes of our civilization.’” In light of those duties, we noted that, “We are confident that neither our grandfather, nor his colleagues with whom he built Paul, Weiss, would have negotiated a truce for themselves when the rest of the legal profession remains under threat for doing its jobs as lawyers. Consistent with his values, he would have above all sought to protect the independence of the bar, not just the firm.”

In writing the letter, we hoped that our small evocation of our grandfather’s enduring values would inspire others to speak out with their own messages of hope and courage in the face of adversity. We have been simultaneously stunned, humbled and honored by the media outlets (including Mississippi Today) and individuals that have chosen to amplify our message.
My grandfather was born in Russia at the turn of the last century. He often said that he was born and lived in the 16th century until, at the age of 9, he left his little village and immigrated with his mother and sisters to the United States. Before he left, he had never seen a power-driven piece of machinery, experienced running water or worn any factory-made garment. As is the case with many immigrants, he arrived in this country with no ability to speak English, but with a determination to make a home here. And also like many immigrants, by his teens, that determination had developed into a deep sense of patriotism. That love of country continued to develop throughout his life, fueled by his own varied personal and professional experiences.
He served the public in a variety of ways. He served as a legislative aide to Sen. Robert Wagner, helping to draft some of the New Deal legislation that helped stem the effects of the Great Depression. In 1945-46, as an advisor to Generals Eisenhower and McNarney in Europe, he brought to light the horror and despair experienced by hundreds of thousands of residents of the displaced persons camps in the wake of the Nazi genocide. He spent a decade as a federal judge in the Southern District of New York and a year as special master for a multi-state dispute over use of the Colorado River. But even in private practice at Paul, Weiss, where he spent most of his career and where many of his clients were large private corporations, he believed his work should, and did, serve the public good.
We all know that lawyers get a bad rap as they are often described as greedy and predatory. But to hear my grandfather talk about the practice of law, as my sister and I did during our family’s regular Sunday afternoon visits to his apartment throughout our childhood, you would think he was part of the noblest profession in the world. As a fierce defender of our adversarial system, he believed everyone deserved vigorous and ethical counsel, no matter how rich or poor, popular or unpopular. He believed that every client, whether paying top dollar or receiving the benefit of pro bono representation, deserved the highest quality of work his or her lawyer could provide.
And he believed, as he wrote at the end of his life, that “lawyers are licensed beneficiaries of privileges and immunities received as gifts from the community in which they practice and that they hold these gifts in trust for the service of the community.” In other words, all lawyers, regardless of the nature of their practice, who take their roles seriously and perform their duties with skill and integrity, provide a benefit to society.
My grandfather’s life spanned nearly the entirety of the 20th Century — a century that, despite some very dark moments, saw our country lead the charge in achieving the greatest advances in freedom and prosperity in human history. And while he benefited from those advances, he never lost sight of the fact that the foundations of that freedom, equality and prosperity are fragile and dependent on the individual and institutional pillars of our American democracy. 
Indeed, in 1954, he wrote: “Every American generation has inherited from its predecessor the memory of freedom, of liberty and of constitutional government; but every generation if it would retain these prizes of our civilization, must reacquire them in its own lifetime. This day when the winds are full of doctrines subversive of the Constitution, inimical to our liberties, is the time to redevelop muscle and determination to defend them. In their defense we shall survive.”  
In the most important respects, my family is not unusual. These principles and values were passed down through casual interactions, a commitment to religious and secular traditions and through modeled behavior. We laughed when my grandfather’s views seemed out of touch with the times. And we used his values as a blueprint to form our own paths and priorities.
I assume most of us grew up with at least some influential figures who adhered to and communicated a set of core values, whether explicitly or by example. And I suspect that despite our different backgrounds and experiences, if we examine those values closely, we will find that there is more that unifies us than divides us.
My sister and I wrote the letter to Mr. Karp as a reminder of what Paul, Weiss’s stated “principles” really mean for the legal profession and for American democracy. In doing so, we revisited those core beliefs ourselves, and hopefully inspired others to as well.
Perhaps, with such values in mind, we can rise above the destructive forces of greed, cynicism and selfish grievance, remember that together we are more than the sum of our parts, and continue our collective march toward freedom, equality and prosperity.

(Photo courtesy of the City of Davenport)As we approach the second anniversary of a tragedy that shocked the people of Davenport and brought national attention to the issue of building safety, government secrecy continues to cloud public understanding of just what happened and who to hold accountable.
The tragedy occurred a few minutes before 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 28, 2023, when the back wall of a Davenport apartment building gave way, bringing down much of the six-story residence that occupied a quarter block across the street from City Hall.
Three people died in the collapse. Rescuers amputated the leg of a fourth victim to free her from the rubble.
Before the dust from bricks and other building materials settled, the community asked  how and why the collapse occurred, who was responsible, and how the city could avoid similar tragedies in the future.
The debris is gone now, and the dead are buried. But questions still linger — largely because local officials continue to use their power and pay attorneys to keep many pertinent documents secreted from journalists and concerned residents.
The Iowa Legislature intended just the opposite when it wrote the state’s public records law 50 years ago. Likewise, sound government does not act this way.
Iowa Senate adds restriction on Capitol security video to open records bill

The latest skirmish in this drawn-out fight over access to records and information comes courtesy of Scott County Attorney Kelly Cunningham. She asked the Iowa Public Information Board last month to ratify her belief that she can keep the report from an independent investigation of the collapse secret.
Her request for a “declaratory order” from the IPIB likely will hit the board’s May 15 agenda, when the staff is expected to recommend whether an Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation report qualifies for a disclosure exemption under the public records act.
While that contention is murky, this much should be crystal clear to the county attorney, the Iowa Public Information Board, and Davenport city officials:
The people of Davenport hunger for facts about the tragedy. They want to know what problems with the building’s structural integrity were reported by tenants before the building fell. They want the facts about the owner’s maintenance of the residence. They want to know the facts about what building code enforcement officials at City Hall did — and did not do — in response to tenant and neighbor complaints before the collapse.
Keeping the DCI report secret further dashes the already damaged public trust and confidence in how local elected officials acted before and after the collapse. Public distrust has intensified since Cunningham decided not to file criminal charges and, instead, asked the IPIB for help to keep the DCI report confidential.
The Iowa Freedom of Information Council, the nonprofit, nonpartisan organization I lead, believes nothing in the public records law prevents Cunningham from releasing the full DCI report, scrubbed only of birth dates and other private personal information about tenants or the names of any confidential sources.
Although Cunningham cites Iowa court decisions to justify her request to keep the DCI report secret, the public records law expressly says confidential documents CAN be made public by the lawful custodian of a record. In this case, Cunningham is that lawful custodian, so the choice is hers if she has the courage to make it.
In her request to the IPIB, Cunningham said, “The concern of the Scott County Attorney is the safety of the public and individuals who in some way were involved with the City of Davenport and/or were perceived to have had something to do with the building collapse. The public involvement and outrage surrounding the May 28, 2023 events has been immense.”
She also told the IPIB that Andrew Wold, the building owner when the collapse occurred, and his building manager have received threats to their safety and protests at their homes.
What Cunningham ignores is that the immense public interest in the DCI report comes from people who want to know precisely, and without spin or favor, what state agents found so the public can hold city leaders accountable for preventing a repeat of the tragedy.
The Iowa Supreme Court, in a 1998 decision, provided a very cogent explanation of the role the public records law has in matters like this: “The purpose of [the public records law] is to open the doors of government to public scrutiny [and] to prevent government from secreting its decision-making activities from the public, on whose behalf it is its duty to act.”
The United States Supreme Court had similar guidance in a 1980 case when the court said: “People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.”
The Quad-City Times summed this up nicely in a recent editorial: “How can we learn without all the facts? The facts don’t belong to public officials. They belong to all of us. Public information can be inconvenient and uncomfortable, but it is vital for a citizen-powered government.”
The message is clear. But why the Scott County attorney has not received the message is anyone’s guess.

(Photo by Antonio Cotrim – Pool/Getty Images)After weeks at death’s door and just hours before his demise, Pope Francis on Easter Sunday met with Vice President J.D. Vance of Ohio. Vance hadn’t been scheduled for an official visit with the pontiff, and the meeting called attention to an issue that has divided Catholics and prominent Republicans in Ohio since last summer — immigration.
Francis, 88, died of a stroke early Monday. Last month, he was discharged from the hospital after a severe health crisis that included pneumonia.
He had clashed for years with President Donald Trump over Trump’s treatment of immigrants. In 2016, just after saying mass on the Mexican side of its border with the United States, Francis said that anyone who advocates building walls is “not Christian.” The Vatican later denied that the remark was directed at Trump, but the president has steadfastly advocated for a wall as he repeats false claims about migrants.
While Trump has pushed for a wall, Francis fought just as hard on behalf of migrants from the time he became pope in 2013. During that time, anti-immigrant rhetoric around the world has grown, while the number of forcibly displaced people has more than doubled, to 120 million, USA Today reported Monday.
In a 2015 speech to Congress, the pope implored lawmakers to help those crossing the southern border fleeing persecution and seeking opportunity.
“Is this not what we want for our own children?” Francis asked. “We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”
He reiterated those sentiments in Sunday’s Easter message.
“I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!’” it said.
Those words stand in stark contrast to the words and actions of Trump and his administration. He has referred to immigrants as “not human” and “animals” who are “poisoning the blood” of the United States. Trump and his allies have referred to undocumented crossings as an “invasion” even after the rhetoric helped spur a racist mass murder in El Paso in 2019.
Trump now is deporting or trying to deport hundreds of thousands who came legally using the CBP One app, unknown numbers of foreign university students.  He’s also dusted off a law not used since World War II to accuse undocumented migrants of gang affiliations and deport them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. The president has ignored court orders related to the latter deportations, and appears headed for a showdown with the U.S. Supreme Court in the matter.
Trump is also trying to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including many Haitians in Springfield.
As the Caribbean nation has descended into chaos, those in the United States are terrified of being forced to return. But during a debate last summer, Trump repeated the racist lie that Haitians in Springfield were stealing their neighbors pets.
“In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” he said. “The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating — they are eating the pets of the people that live there.”
In the ensuing furor, dozens of bomb threats were made against public buildings, including elementary schools.
As a U.S. Senator representing Ohio, those threats jeopardized Vance’s constituents. But he repeated the lies even after his staff knew they were untrue.
The episode divided some Ohio Republicans who also happened to be Catholic.
Vance became one in 2019. Gov. Mike DeWine is a lifelong Catholic who has stayed all executions since taking office and signed a harsh anti-abortion bill into law.
During last year’s firestorm in Springfield, the governor criticized Trump and Vance in the New York Times.
“I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,” DeWine wrote. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.”
Less than two months later, Trump and Vance won the election. Then in January, the president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council met with Pope Francis at the Vatican and then said Trump’s planned deportations and aid cuts would be calamitous for his country.
In February, Francis wrote a letter to U.S. bishops saying that Trump would create a “major crisis” with the mass deportations he planned. The pope also slammed the interpretation of Catholic theology Vance used to justify them.
Vance had invoked the doctrine “ordo amoris” to claim that one should think of family, then community, then country ahead of the rest of the world.
The pope said that was wrong. He noted that Jesus himself was forced to seek refuge in a foreign land.
“Jesus Christ… did not live apart from the difficult experience of being expelled from his own land because of an imminent risk to his life, and from the experience of having to take refuge in a society and a culture foreign to his own,” Francis said in his letter.
He added that people should consider all as being part of their families and communities.
“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan‘ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,” the pope said.
He then sank into a 38-day hospitalization. Then he rallied, defied doctors’ orders and spent a busy Easter Sunday, the most important day on the Christian calendar. And he made room for a brief meeting with Vance as one of his last acts.
Coming a day after the pope’s lieutenants said they talked to Vance about “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the meeting seemed intended to send a message. “Pope Francis Gave JD Vance a serious lesson just hours before he died,” was the title of a column Hafiz Rashid wrote in The New Republic.
Vance honored the pontiff after his passing in a post on X. But he made no mention of migrants.
“I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he said. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the… homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul.”
For his part, DeWine acknowledged the pope’s relentless advocacy for migrants.
“He was an inspiration to us and to millions around the world,” DeWine said in a written statement. “His genuine love of and devotion to all people — the poor, the unborn, those without a home, those emigrating to build a better life for themselves and their families, those of all faiths, and those with no faith — was evidenced to the world from the day he was selected to serve as Pope until his last public appearance on Easter Sunday.”

(Photo by Megan Gleason / Source NM)Tree deaths in New Mexico forests have doubled since 2023, according to a state survey released Monday, driven by insects and stress from prolonged warmer conditions.
Those deaths include 70,000 acres of conifer trees  in 2024, more than twice the 33,000 acres recorded the year prior.
Native insects largely drove the tree damage, according to Victor Lucero, coordinator for the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department’s Forest Health Program.
“Especially in bark beetles, longer, warmer and drier conditions stretching further into the fall, these insects can increase the number of generations they have each season,” Lucero told Source NM.
The New Mexico Forest Health Conditions 2024 survey assessed approximately 14 million acres of forests by air across state, private, federal and tribal forests. About 406,000 acres showed damage from disease, insects and drought, a growth of 12%, with 42,000 more acres than last year.
Wildfire also played a role.
Officials surveyed forests surrounding the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon and McBride fire burn scars for the 2024 survey, following a  one-year pause because fire damage looks similar  to disease or insect damage.
Stands of trees that initially survived the fires in both burn scars experienced heavy impacts from bark-beetle activity recorded this year, Lucero said, with long-term stress from drought and the fires reducing the trees’ ability to create sap and resin to defend against the insects.
Beyond the beetle, the trees suffered an increase in defoliation, or the loss of needles or leaves, from insects such as caterpillars of the Douglas-fir tussock moth, which defoliated 18,000 acres within mixed conifer forests — a jump from last year due to wetter conditions.
Drought conditions, which have been ongoing for decades in New Mexico, eased slightly last year, with a strong monsoon system offering relief in the forests, reducing heat and drought impacts by 65%.
However, New Mexico’s warming climate will stress forests and promote longer insect seasons, Lucero said.
“As conditions continue to be hotter and drier, forests and woodlands need to be managed for those conditions,” he said. “That translates to managing forests by thinning — reducing the number of trees competing for water, sunlight and soil volume.”
Lucero said he understands this may seem counterintuitive.
“We want to save the forest, and we want to thin the forest to save it,” he said. “With drought and warming conditions, we want healthy trees that can naturally combat the attacks made by insects.”

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette is developing an artificial intelligence and data analysis tool the Louisiana Department of Health will use to fight “fraud, waste and abuse,” state officials said. The university is developing the technology that could be deployed within a week to begin looking for instances of fraud in the Medicaid program, ULL Vice President for Research Ramesh Kolluru said in an interview.
“We are committed to improving government efficiencies in Louisiana using innovation,” Kolluru said. “Our first mission … is to improve efficiency and integrity of the Louisiana Medicaid program.” 
The state health department has created a “Fighting Fraud, Waste and Abuse” task force to detect wrongdoing within Medicaid, Undersecretary Drew Maranto said. The agency will partner with LA DOGE, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry’s version of Elon Musk’s controversial Department of Government Efficiency. A Medicaid fraud control unit already exist
The AI technology is being trained on national data and peer-reviewed publications that have identified fraud, and it will then be tasked with finding similar patterns in Louisiana’s Medicaid data, Kolluru said. Staff within the Louisiana Department of Health will verify any findings, he added. 
Maranto said the department will also be working with the state Office of Motor Vehicles to check if any Medicaid recipients have active drivers licenses in other states, which could help them determine their eligibility to receive Medicaid benefits in Louisiana.   
ULL’s work on the AI program will not cost the health department because it already contracts with the university for other computing projects, Kolluru said. 
ULL will also partner with the state Office of Technology Services to “modernize Louisiana Medicaid systems,” Kolluru said.

In addition to detailing the counterfraud measures, Greenstein said the state has set a goal to reduce drug overdose deaths during pregnancy by 80% over the next three years.
Overdose deaths have been the leading cause of maternal mortality in Louisiana since 2018, LDH Deputy Secretary Dr. Pete Croughan said. 
The new initiative, Project MOM (Maternal Overdose Mortality) will push to increase the availability of naloxone and buprenorphine, medications that can halt the effects of opioid overdoses when administered promptly. Other goals include more training health care providers on opioid use disorders and using money from settlements with opioid manufacturers to expand residential treatment facilities and outpatient clinics.
According to publicly available data, there were 28 overdoses during pregnancy in 2020, the most recent year data in available. LDH is setting a goal to reduce overdose pregnancy deaths in the state by 80% over three years, reducing the death rate to five or six people annually. The department expects to appoint a Project MOM director within 90 days.
Greenstein also announced the state would be moving away from having a single pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for its Medicaid program. Such entities have been labeled as “middlemen” that process prescription drug claims for the managed care organizations that provide Medicaid services, with critics saying they don’t provide enough transparency to determine whether they provide any cost savings to patients.
Since October 2021, Louisiana has worked with Magellan Medicaid Administration as its sole prescription benefit manager. On Monday, Maranto said the department would work closely with its managed care organizations who run the state’s Medicaid program and pharmacies to “ensure the best approach to managing these benefits.”
The continued closures of chain and independent pharmacies threatens patient access to critical prescription drugs across Louisiana, Maranto added. The state’s new approach will lean on the private contractors for Medicaid to handle prescription claims while also keeping drug prices in check.

Among those storefronts damaged was Ashewell Medical Group, Dr. Carly Brown's primary care clinic. (Photo: Courtesy of Carly Brown)Just a fraction of homes and businesses in western North Carolina were insured against the floodwaters that deluged the region during Hurricane Helene.
An estimated 10.2% of commercial properties had FEMA-backed flood insurance, and just 5.2% of homes were protected.
The low figures had devastating implications in the face of Helene, a lower-windspeed, heavy-rain storm that hit mountainous communities poorly acquainted with flooding. When the water subsided and recovery began, it became clear that many wouldn’t be reimbursed for the kind of damage their buildings had suffered.
But even for those that were protected, it’s been a long road. Six months after Helene, some property owners looking for a bounce back through insurance have struggled to access it.
It took until late March for one business owner to see any payment — and when it came, it was just a fraction of what she had expected. Another was able to recoup some flood money, but was bewildered when he was denied payment on other parts of his policies. And a larger group of business owners in the region’s largest city are considering going to court to pursue money they believe they qualify for.



Two businesses’ long paths to payment
Bryan and Angela King, who own 12 Bones Smokehouse & Brewing, filed claims on both of their locations: one on the river by Asheville’s downtown River Arts District, and the other further south.
The Kings had been paying into their insurance on the south location since it opened in 2019; they had put down around $300,000 total there, Bryan King estimated.
They were able to get about $100,000 from flood insurance, he told NC Newsline, but they were denied reimbursement on two other policies: contents and business disruption. Contents insurance covers flood damage to movable objects within a building; business disruption insurance covers lost income, often after a disaster.
King kept in frequent contact with other business owners in the area. He heard similar stories — particularly as others tried to navigate those same contents and business disruptions policies. Now, he told NC Newsline, a group of them are considering going to court over the matter.
“There’s discussion of trying to pursue a class-action lawsuit,” King said in a late March interview. “I honestly think that’s basically going to be the only way that we get anything out of this.”
North Carolinians who have sought insurance payouts in the months since Helene described other similar frustrations and bureaucratic hurdles that complicated an already fraught process.
That includes homeowners who told the Asheville news station WLOS that they had received cancellation notices from their providers months after the storm.
Among the other layers of complexity: adjusters who live out of state, multiple subcontractors and extensive documentation requirements.
Carly Brown, who runs Ashewell Medical Group in Asheville, told NC Newsline her provider had subcontracted out to another group, which had then subcontracted out to another adjuster.
When Brown finally received a flood insurance payment in late March — six months after the storm — it was a “fraction of our losses.” Her practice’s office had filled with 11 feet of flood water during the storm. She, too, has now engaged with a law firm.
“They just nickel and dime you after paying faithfully on a flood policy for eight years,” Brown said. “You think you’re doing everything right, being a responsible business owner and citizen. Then the insurance companies essentially keep all their profits, without upholding their responsibilities.”



The Kings ran into other barriers as they filed their claims.
They were told by their Utah-based adjuster that as part of their documentation, they needed a letter from Duke Energy testifying that the damage to their south Asheville location was from wind, and not water.
That seemed unnecessary, Bryan King said — there was no real flooding in that area, but there were plenty of downed trees and power lines to show for the whipping winds.
“You definitely get the sense that it’s like they’re trying to make it as hard as possible,” he said. “So that people just give up. Like, you know, ‘screw it — I don’t have time to work on this, I’ve got a business to run, and I don’t think we’re going to get it anyway.’”
Duke Energy said customers could request a power outage verification letter by contacting the company’s customer care team.
“During significant weather events, multiple factors can contribute to outages, making it difficult to identify a single cause of a power outage,” a Duke Energy spokesperson said in a statement to NC Newsline. “Our primary focus is restoring power as quickly and safely as possible for our customers and communities.”

The chair of the North Carolina House Insurance Committee, Rep. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), said she had heard from constituents about slogging through insurance in the region — specifically on business disruption claims, some of which are denied outright.
“I’m asking the insurance commissioner to kind of help me look into what’s going on, and we’re trying to get some specifics so that we can work with those individuals,” said Balkcom, whose district was among those that were hardest hit by Helene.
In western North Carolina, spotty insurance coverage meant confusion
There are around 150,000 flood insurance policies in place in North Carolina, according to FEMA and NC Department of Insurance data. The vast majority of those (around 130,000) are federal policies; the rest are private.
Many of those policies are for properties in eastern North Carolina, which has been struck multiple times in recent decades by deadly hurricanes. The extent of the mountainous west’s coverage pales in comparison: according to FEMA data, there are a total of just 1,295 federal policies in the region’s most populous county of Buncombe and its communities, including Asheville.
A total of 1.8 million North Carolinians live in the 25 counties that were part of Helene’s disaster zone.
Jason Tyson, communications director for the NC Department of Insurance, said in an interview that Helene had brought about “a whole variety of situations and scenarios” in the region. The minimal flood coverage, he said, combined with early communication struggles and a host of different providers, often led to confusion.
“I think the industry and the carriers have done the best they can, in light of difficult circumstances,” Tyson said.
The department has asked providers to report updated data on claims periodically in the months after Helene.
The scope of that information is limited, as it does not include federal flood policies. And only data from one reporting deadline — January — is available publicly. NC Newsline requested and received claims data from October 2024. Data from the department’s other reporting deadlines, in November and December, are not posted publicly and were not provided.
But the data that is available gives a sense to how complex — and long — some flood claims can be.



As of January, 32.4% of those private flood claims were closed. That’s a far lower closure rate than other types of claims made after Helene. Residential property claims had closed at an 84.4% rate; just over 70% of business interruption claims had closed as of January.
Those 547 reported private flood claims account for more than a half-billion dollars in damage, according to DOI’s data. Just over $240 million had been paid as of January.
The department is expected to have updated data from providers in the coming weeks.
FEMA’s federal flood insurance program (NFIP) paid out almost $214 million to North Carolinians in 2024, across more than 2,500 claims. That’s roughly 20% of the total paid out by the program to the state over the last decade.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dji_fly_2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182
,California,2025-04-22 16:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,How do high schoolers in your area really fare after graduation? A new California tool lets you know,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/04/california-high-school-graduates-tracker/,California’s new Cradle to Career dashboards track students' college paths and earnings after high school graduation — but leave out some key details.,"In summary
California’s new Cradle to Career dashboards track students’ college paths and earnings after high school graduation — but leave out some key details.


Want to know how students at your child’s school district are performing five or even 10 years down the line? 
Today, California released a new tool that aims to make that question — and many others — much easier to answer. Known as the Cradle to Career Data System, these new “dashboards” consolidate data from roughly 3.5 million high school graduates in California, showing where they enrolled in college, what kinds of degrees they earned, and the wages they made four years after receiving a college diploma or certificate. 
For years, parents and researchers alike have complained that accessing education data is unnecessarily hard — with information spread out across various websites, drop-down menus and graphics. A new data system was a key priority for the Newsom administration, though it faced months of delays, in part because of data privacy concerns. 
“We have people who’ve been calling for this (data system) for 10 years, for 20 years,” said Mary Ann Bates, executive director of the Cradle to Career Data System. “The effort the state is making now to bring this together is so that students, families, educators and policymakers can have this information at their fingertips.”
Some other states, such as Kentucky, have already pioneered better approaches, creating a single, understandable website that houses data from the state’s K-12, college and workforce providers. In 2019, California allocated more than $24 million so it could catch up.  
But today’s data tool represents just a fraction of the state’s education and workforce data. It only looks at students who attend one of California’s public colleges and universities and it only looks at students who graduate from a public high school. One tool by the California Department of Education shows that among 2015 California public high school graduates who headed to college, 15% went to a private or out-of-state college or university within 16 months.
Bates said her team will eventually update these public dashboards to include information about students who attend private or out-of-state colleges and who don’t graduate high school. 
As part of this data system, the state has also promised to release other data, including information about early childhood education and teachers’ training and retention. Bates’ team initially said the teacher training information would be available by June 2024, but it remains in limbo. She said that tool would be released “soon,” though she did not specify a date. 
How useful is it?
Although the Cradle to Career Data System is presenting information in new ways, the information itself isn’t new. California has already developed similar tools, but none so widely accessible to the public or incorporating data from so many different schools and state agencies. 
The state Education Department already allowed users to download data and sort college-going rates by school or district, although it’s unlikely most parents would spend the time to download the spreadsheet and try to understand all the column names. One strength of the system is its ease of use — the tool displays key data visually and intuitively.
But each data system may use slightly different numbers. For example, the department uses DataQuest, which has a broader definition of what it means to “graduate” high school. The Cradle to Career Data System looks only at traditional graduates and not people who receive a GED, said Ryan Estrellado, the Cradle to Career system’s director of data programs.
The nonprofit Educational Results Partnership operated one of the many predecessors to the Cradle to Career Data System, and president Alex Barrios said he’s skeptical that the state’s new tool is a real improvement. 
“If the dashboard doesn’t start the cohort at 9th grade, then the dashboard is useless,” wrote Barrios in a text to CalMatters. Just over 88% of students who started as ninth graders finished high school five years later, according to 2024 state data, but for certain groups, such as African American or Native American students, the graduation rates were lower. 
Without information about high school dropouts, the new tool makes it look like students attend college at higher rates than they actually do, he said. It’s called the Cradle to Career Data System, he added, not the “the High School Graduation to College Data System.” In the previous tool that Barrios helped operate, known as Cal-PASS Plus, researchers could look not just at high school graduates but also at all students who enrolled in 9th grade. 
Bates said the Cradle to Career Data System is only as powerful as the data that schools and agencies share. This current data uses information from the past 10 years, which is only enough time to measure the long-term college and career outcomes of high school graduates, she said, adding that other data, such as information about the long-term fates of younger students, will be added as it’s available. 
Although the data lacks certain features, it may still lead to powerful findings: One of the new data dashboards shows that community college students who receive a certificate earn more than those who receive an associate degree— even though certificate programs typically take much less time to complete. 
The Cradle to Career Data System is “a neutral source of information,” said Bates. “Our office is not going to weigh in on specific policies or interpret the why.”

(Photo via National Park Service)Gov. Ron DeSantis added a new front to his dispute with the House during a Tuesday press conference: Funding for Everglades restoration.
The governor bashed House leadership on Earth Day because the House’s proposed budget includes $279 million toward Everglades restoration, but DeSantis said his plan included $800 million for it.
“A lot of the reason they’re doing it is because the leadership in the House of Representatives has taken a position that if I’m for something, that it’s their view to just oppose us, just in a knee-jerk fashion,” DeSantis said during the press conference at the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Naples.
But DeSantis thanked Senate President Ben Albritton, saying the upper chamber’s budget “basically agreed” with his $800 million proposal. However, the Senate only includes $625 million for Everglades restoration.
The dispute with the House has dominated press conferences the governor has held recently, as he has attacked the House on rising condominium fees, funding for the Florida Highway Patrol, and the probe into Hope Florida.
“We’re getting into this regularity, where [DeSantis] has a temper tantrum,” House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters last Wednesday. “He gets in front of a camera, and he starts to do one of two things: Either … willingly choosing to lie about what he is telling the people in front of a camera, or he is choosing to not read the bills or look at our budget.”
Alexis Lambert, secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; and Roger Young, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission executive director, joined the governor in talking about maintaining momentum in Everglades restoration.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)A group of eight Republicans in the Minnesota House have introduced legislation (HF3219) that would designate certain vaccines and medical treatments as “weapons of mass destruction” and make possessing or administering them a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
The legislation specifically targets messenger RNA (mRNA) treatments, which include several COVID-19 vaccines. Those vaccines have saved millions of lives and are considered one of the most important medical and public health achievements of the 21st century so far.
The bill’s language appears to have been drafted by Joseph Sansone, a Florida hypnotist and conspiracy theorist who believes that mRNA treatments are “nanoparticle injections” that amount to “biological and technological weapons of mass destruction.” 
Sansone has falsely claimed that “more Americans have died from mRNA injections than in WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War combined,” and has said he has stood “alongside an Army of the Dead” to file unsuccessful legal complaints against vaccines in Florida.
The bill has no chance of passage given the narrow margins in the House and Senate, as well as the DFL’s control of the governorship. But its support among multiple Republican representatives, including several members of GOP House leadership, give a sense of how the party would govern if it controlled the state legislature.
The Minnesota Republicans sponsoring the bill include Shane Mekeland (Clear Lake), Krista Knudsen (Lake Shore), Assistant GOP Floor Leader Walter Hudson (Albertville), Jeff Dotseth (Silver Township), Tom Murphy (Underwood), Pam Altendorf (Red Wing), Keith Allen (Kenyon), and Deputy Speaker Pro Tempore Isaac Schultz (Elmdale). Several have also sponsored a marginally less extreme bill (HF 3152) that would make administering mRNA vaccines a misdemeanor subject to a $500 penalty.
The Reformer requested comment from several of the bill sponsors but none responded. 
In addition to vaccines for infectious diseases, mRNA technology holds tremendous promise for treating cancer and other ailments. Thousands of cancer patients are currently participating in trials of personalized mRNA vaccines targeting various types of tumors. 
Minnesota’s Mayo Clinic has been at the forefront of some of that research, which would be criminalized under the proposed bill.
The language in the bill further bans “nanotechnology or nanoparticles that alter genes and create a biosynthetic cell replication,” which could impact other cutting-edge medical technologies like CRISPR. It also bans “any human gene therapy product for any infectious disease indication.”
The bill compels state and local authorities to “use all lawful means necessary” to enforce its provisions, and would subject authorities to prosecution under existing weapons of mass destruction statutes if they refused to investigate alleged violations of the law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/210202_vm_covid_vaccine_0212-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 13:16:25.250182

(Getty image)The imposition of tariffs on energy imports from Canada jeopardizes both our climate targets and the economic security of millions of residents and businesses across New England and New York.
President Trump has imposed broad 25% tariffs on Canadian imports. It remains unclear whether these tariffs apply to electricity (the Trump administration issued no clarification), an intangible good that has never before been subject to import duties.
The Northeast has long been a leader in clean energy innovation, setting ambitious goals to transition to a more sustainable, affordable, and reliable power grid. Tariffs of this magnitude on clean Canadian electricity imports are a direct attack on affordability, burdening U.S. consumers with an estimated $400 million in additional costs annually.
These tariffs will be felt particularly during peak-demand periods, when the Northeast’s reliance on Canadian electricity is most acute. During these hours, tariffs could increase wholesale electricity prices by up to 30%. These costs disproportionately affect working families and small businesses that are already struggling with high energy costs.
At a time when states like Massachusetts and New York are working to expand clean energy infrastructure and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the artificial price increases from tariffs will drive clean and affordable hydroelectricity from Canada out of energy markets. The result is the opposite effect of what our state policies seek and instead will drive up costs and push the region further into dependence on natural gas and oil.
Massachusetts alone is expected to see a $200 million increase in electricity if 25% tariffs are imposed on Canadian electricity imports.
Beyond the financial impact, tariffs will undermine the reliability of the Northeast’s power grid. Just this year, during the coldest periods of January and February, Canadian energy exports accounted for 10% of New York’s demand and 15% in New England, rising to 20% during peak-demand hours.
With the added tariff costs on imports, our region will inevitably rely more heavily on fossil fuel plants that are vulnerable to fuel supply shortages and price spikes during extreme weather events. The energy market works by selecting the least expensive form of energy available to provide the required amount of energy demanded by the market. If tariffs make otherwise affordable Canadian hydroelectricity more expensive than oil and gas, the market will choose those less costly sources.
Some parts of our region are especially vulnerable. Certain rural areas in Vermont and Northern Maine, which are directly linked to electric grids in Canada and have no viable alternative supply, could be hardest hit. Tariffs could lead to millions of dollars in increased costs annually, exacerbating energy insecurity for residents who already face higher-than-average electricity prices.
Imposing tariffs on Canadian hydroelectricity is not just bad economics—it’s bad climate policy. With the withdrawal of this affordable, clean energy source, the region will be forced to burn more natural gas and oil, leading to an estimated 10 million additional tons of carbon emissions annually — annual emissions equivalent to those emitted by every car registered in New York City.
This is a step backward at a time when we should be accelerating our clean energy transition. The Northeast has set aggressive goals to cut emissions and transition to 100% clean power, yet these tariffs will make clean energy less competitive, slowing progress toward a carbon-free grid.
Supporters of these tariffs argue that they will level the playing field for domestic energy producers but, in reality, they will undermine the market forces that are driving innovation and competition in the clean energy sector.
They completely ignore the interconnected nature of the U.S.-Canadian electricity system, which has historically provided economic, reliability, and environmental benefits to both countries. Just last week, New York State released a report assessing tariff impacts. State agencies conclude that “losing access to Canadian imports during the peak summer cooling months could create significant reliability challenges.”
New York and New England cannot afford to let anything but the public interest and cost dictate energy policy. These tariffs will raise prices, reduce reliability, and set back the clean energy transition at a time when we need to accelerate progress, not stall it.
Governors, legislators, and regulators in the Northeast must visibly stand together against these tariffs, advocating for continued access to affordable, clean electricity. Businesses, labor groups, and community organizations must also speak out, making it clear that these policies will harm local economies, cost jobs, and increase energy burdens for working families.

The University of Alabama had not confirmed Trump’s appearance as of Tuesday morning. Messages seeking comment were left with university officials on Tuesday. 
The university has eight graduation ceremonies from May 2-4. 
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, an Alabama graduate, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that she was looking forward to the address.
“What a tremendous honor for my alma mater. Looking forward to a historic occasion for graduates and their families,” the post said.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration has challenged the legal status of foreign students on college campuses around the nation. The Associated Press said that at least 1,024 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March.
Officials with Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) detained Alireza Douroudi, an Alabama doctoral student from Iran, in March. Doroudi was denied bond last week, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not named any charges. Auburn said in a statement last week that 15 foreign students or personnel on its campus had their visas cancelled. 
Trump won 65% of Alabama’s vote in last November’s presidential election. His margin in Tuscaloosa County, the home of the University of Alabama, was about 60%.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)As the Trump administration takes aim at diversity initiatives in both the public and private sectors, a New Jersey lawmaker wants to require all state agencies and departments to have a diversity, equity, and inclusion office.
Under new legislation, each office would be led by a chief DEI officer who would oversee programs that promote cross-cultural education and employee engagement. Bill sponsor Assemblyman Reginald Atkins (D-Union) said as one of the most diverse states in the country, New Jersey should have a government reflective of its people. 
“This bill is important because it makes sure every state department and agency is thinking about equity and inclusion in a real way, not just talking about it. It gives structure to something we say we value: making sure all communities are treated fairly and represented,” Atkins told the New Jersey Monitor. 
The measure would also require the office to keep track of relevant data and find ways to improve agencies “with the goal of facilitating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace.”
The legislation stresses that no data would be used for civil immigration enforcement.
His bill comes amid a national trend of rolling back DEI programs. A wave of corporations revoked their DEI policies after President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders in his first week in office terminating all DEI offices in the federal government and cutting contracts with companies that provide DEI training, among other things.
New Jersey said last week it wouldn’t follow the Trump administration’s demand to certify that Garden State schools have no “DEI practices in violation of federal law.” The federal Department of Education has said it would withhold funding from states that don’t comply with Trump’s order to jettison all DEI initiatives. 
Atkins didn’t comment directly on Trump’s move to end diversity programs. His bill, which has a Senate companion bill sponsored by Sen. Angela McKnight (D-Hudson), has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing.

The Tennessee House of Representatives voted 84-10 with one abstention Monday to place the matter in voters’ hands. It received the approval of the required two-thirds of the Senate in March.
The issue will appear on the Nov. 3, 2026 gubernatorial ballot and must receive a majority vote from participants in that election’s governor’s race to become law. 
The proposed amendment would strip the right to bail “when the proof is evident or the presumption great” from defendants charged with any of 73 felony crimes for which Tennessee requires convicted people to serve at least 85% of their sentence.
Those crimes include second-degree murder, acts of terrorism, aggravated rape of a child, vehicular homicide, aggravated burglary and the third felony offense of manufacture, sale or delivery of a controlled substance. 
The decision of whether to grant bail would lie in the hands of the judge.

Tennessee’s constitution currently safeguards the right to bail for all prisoners except for capital offenses (functionally, first-degree murder and rape of a child under age 12).
The ballot measure’s opponents said it would deny due process for those accused – not convicted – of these crimes.
“We are already deciding who should be in jail and who should not be in jail as if our criminal legal system is perfect, as if our criminal legal system always gets this right,” Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, said. “… Taking somebody’s liberty is not a small thing.”
House Speaker Cameron Sexton, a Crossville Republican, sponsored the resolution and took the unusual step of stepping down from the dais to present it from the well.
Sexton said the removal of the right to bail would not be automatic because of the judge’s discretion in applying the law.
He said he also hopes this proposal could address the artificial inflation of bail and the practice of trumping up charges to raise bail to a point that a defendant cannot pay and must remain incarcerated before trial. It “sets an even playing field between those of all income levels based on the crime as well, in my view,” Sexton said.
Reps. G.A. Hardaway and Antonio Parkinson, both Memphis Democrats, spoke in support of the ballot measure. Parkinson said his constituency is “sick” of violent crime in their community.
Pearson and Nashville Democratic Rep. Vincent Dixie said leaving a defendant’s right to bail to a judge’s discretion does not assuage concerns.
“Judges are imperfect people with their own biases as well that they bring into the courtroom, and there can again be a disproportionate harm on poor folks, a disproportionate harm on Black folks, on Latino folks,” Pearson said. 
Sexton said this line of thinking minimizes trust in judges, who are often elected.
“You deny bail and keep people … incarcerated who you’re afraid to put out on the streets,” he said. “Everybody else you should be giving bail to. They should have reasonable bail.”










Judges are imperfect people with their own biases as well that they bring into the courtroom, and there can again be a disproportionate harm on poor folks, a disproportionate harm on Black folks, on Latino folks.


– Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis


The proposed amendment has seen support from the Tennessee Sheriff’s Association and the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference.
Pearson agreed that the crimes included in the proposed amendment are heinous. 
“But when we talk about safety and protecting people, we also have to protect the people who are being sentenced who have not committed the crime for which they are being accused,” he said.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)In February, the Trump administration sent a letter to all state education departments with a broad message: diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools must come to an end. Every public K-12 school and university must stop policies related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or face a potential loss to their funding, the letter stated.
This month, a New Hampshire federal judge is grappling with whether to stop the government from enforcing the letter.
A group of organizations — the National Education Association, the National Education Association of New Hampshire, and the Center for Black Educator Development — have sued the U.S. Department of Education in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block enforcement of the letter. The suit is being litigated by the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire.
On Thursday, April 17, Judge Landya McCafferty presided over oral arguments in the lawsuit. She’s weighing whether to issue a preliminary injunction.
The requirement is not immediate; after an extension agreed to last week, state education agencies have until April 24 to certify that the state’s schools have agreed to the conditions in the letter. But plaintiffs are hoping McCafferty issues the injunction sometime next week to halt enforcement before that deadline arrives.
Plaintiffs argue that because the letter threatens financial repercussions against school districts that allow for DEI programs, it could in turn force schools to drop support for NEA and CBED teacher diversity programs. And the NEA says the vagueness of the letter will push its teacher members to take defensive measures and avoid teaching certain topics if they think there will be professional consequences for doing so.
But the government says plaintiffs are overreacting to the letter, which they say simply warns school districts not to fall afoul of Title VI, a federal statute that prevents discrimination in public programs based on race or national origin, and promises investigations and potential withholding of federal funding for those districts that do.
‘Dear colleague letter’
The letter that kicked off the dispute, known as a “dear colleague letter,” presents a stark portrait of public schools.
“Educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon ‘systemic and structural racism’ and advanced discriminatory policies and practices,” the letter reads. “Proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them — particularly during the last four years — under the banner of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’…”
The letter relies on Students for Fair Admissions Inc v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, a landmark 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court held that the race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
And it says the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights would “vigorously enforce the law” and that institutions that failed to comply with federal law may “face potential loss of federal funding.”
“The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation’s educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent.”
To the U.S. Department of Justice, the letter is not an official agency rule; rather, it is an interpretive guidance. That means it can’t be struck down by a court the way a rule can, they argued.
Abhishek Kambli, a U.S. deputy associate attorney general who traveled to Concord to argue the case Thursday, said the letter is simply articulating existing law preventing school districts from classifying students according to their race. Kambli pointed to the Students for Fair Admissions decision, and said the dear colleague letter is simply trying to stop K-12 schools from that kind of discrimination, Kambli told the court Thursday. Already, U.S. case law has established that schools should not make distinctions on the basis of race or other characteristics except in rare circumstances, Kambli argued. And he said those circumstances must face a legal test of strict scrutiny to pass.
The plaintiff’s hardship, Kambli said, “is due to self-censorship based on a misunderstanding of what the dear colleague letter says.”
Kambli added that the government does not claim diversity, equity, and inclusion itself is illegal; rather, it claims that schools that are already breaking the law by classifying students by race should not use the concept of DEI as an excuse to do so.
And he said despite the colorful language in the letter, any decision by the federal government to withhold funding to a school could come only after an investigation, and would include the possibility of an appeal. “It’s a lengthy process,” he said.
Actions chilling, plaintiffs argue
But plaintiffs say the government’s characterization understates the impact and scope of the letter.
The letter creates the possibility of consequences for teachers because of its threat to punish school districts, who directly employ those teachers, Sarah Hinger, deputy director of the ACLU’s Racial Justice Program argued Thursday. And she said the letter contains pronouncements that are hard for teachers to apply to their instruction.
“Every day, today, tomorrow, they go to work and they are tasked with following the dear colleague letter, along with all their other obligations,” Hinger said. “They are chilled now in their ability to speak. … They are uncertain of what practices they can engage in.”
Hinger also pointed to the Trump administration’s swift move to withhold funding from Columbia University and Harvard University, suggesting that the administration could move quickly to block funding to public schools if it decides to.
“The chill from that is happening now, and plaintiffs are not required to wait until they are hauled into court in order to challenge an unconstitutional law,” she said. McCafferty appeared sympathetic to plaintiffs, asking Kambli questions about how teachers could cover periods of American history like Reconstruction or the Jim Crow South without worrying they were improperly teaching that America has structural racism.
The case bears similarity to another lawsuit alleging that New Hampshire’s 2021 “banned concepts” law prohibiting public school teachers from advocating for certain topics around race and gender is unconstitutional. In 2024, the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire agreed with plaintiffs and struck that law down; the decision is currently being appealed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Kambli said those lawsuits were different because they involved state laws that directly affected teachers. The dear colleague letter should not have a direct effect on the topics that can be taught, he argued.
“It goes toward how they treat students,” he said. “It doesn’t go toward what they teach.”
And Kambli argued the suing organizations are not linked directly to the Department of Education’s enforcement action, and lack standing to bring a case in the first place.
Lawyers for the ACLU are attempting to add a handful of New Hampshire school districts as parties to the case, in order to make additional arguments about how the letter would unfairly affect them. But the government argued it needs more time to file a motion countering those arguments, and McCafferty has not yet approved the districts’ inclusion to the case.
For now, the parties are expecting McCafferty to issue a ruling on the injunction before next Thursday. Lawyers for the government asked her to issue a narrow injunction that affects only the named plaintiffs if she must issue one; lawyers for the plaintiffs urged a nationwide injunction.
Under the agreement reached last week, any New Hampshire school district that signs a letter certifying that they will comply with the letter will not be bound to that letter until April 24, meaning that if the court enjoins the letter before then, the district will not be subject to it. As of Thursday, 165 New Hampshire school districts have signed on, according to the Department of Education’s website.
At a press conference after the hearing, Hinger said she hopes McCafferty will act quickly.
“I think that the government has shown a track record of avoiding and ignoring careful due process, moving swiftly against institutions and using the full power of its authority against individuals in the education sector and beyond,” she said.

After pausing during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency has not collected on defaulted loans in over five years. More than 5 million borrowers sit in default on their federal student loans, and just 38% of borrowers are current on their payments, the department said.
“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Monday.
During last year’s presidential campaign, President Donald Trump criticized his predecessor and successor, President Joe Biden, for his efforts to erase student debt. McMahon resumed that line of attack Monday, blaming Biden’s administration for unreasonably raising borrowers’ expectations of forgiveness.
“The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers,” McMahon said.
She added that “going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment — both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation’s economic outlook.”
The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will restart the Treasury Offset Program, which the U.S. Treasury Department administers, on May 5.
The Education Department statement said all borrowers who are in default will get emails over the next two weeks “making them aware of these developments and urging them to contact the Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or sign up for loan rehabilitation.”
The department said the Office of Federal Student Aid will “send required notices beginning administrative wage garnishment” later this summer.
More than 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the department. 
The administration claims that “instead of protecting responsible taxpayers, the Biden-Harris Administration put them on the hook for irresponsible lending, pushing the federal student loan portfolio toward a fiscal cliff.”

Developers in Connecticut are looking for ways to ease the squeeze placed on middle-income renters.
Not only is there a lack of deeply affordable apartments in Fairfield County, but there aren’t enough options for renters on the higher end of the affordability needs, according to Andrew Bolger, a senior data and research analyst at the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority (CHFA), a quasi-public agency that helps create affordable housing.
“There are more units available than there are households in the middle of the market,” Bolger said.
Bolger explained this is causing a squeezing effect in the middle.
Recently at a Fairfield County Talks Housing meeting, Bolger outlined new data regarding Fairfield County’s housing market. It showed that many renters are being forced to pay more than they can comfortably afford for an apartment, and other renters are opting for apartments below what they could afford, leaving less options for lower-income renters.
“Because there’s a lack of units that are affordable to the lowest income renters, they are essentially forced to rent up into units that are affordable to someone, say, someone earning 50% AMI (area median income),” Bolger said.
In Fairfield County, the average rent has increased between 20% and 30% over the last six years, Bolger said.
Recently, CHFA stepped up efforts to generate housing for different income levels in Fairfield County, funding several mixed-income housing developments in Bridgeport, Darien and Greenwich.
Along with generating more affordable rental options, CHFA works to educate prospective homeowners on the homebuying process. It also creates affordable homeownership opportunities.
CHFA provides assistance to homebuyers earning below 120% AMI.
“In Bridgeport that equates to, depending on the household size and location, about $133,000 up to $171,000,” Bolger said.
CHFA also operates Connecticut’s Time to Own program, which provides forgivable loans for first-time homebuyers. In Fairfield County, nearly 500 families have been able to purchase homes through the program since it began in 2022.
CHFA is keeping an eye on how the current presidential administration may impact its programming, Community Engagement Officer Terry Nash said.
Some programs cannot be eliminated or defunded immediately since they are in place by law, Nash said.
“HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) funding has been paused, but not eliminated, and there are certain programs that are now under review for audit,” Nash said. “It seems like everything’s up for review. So we’ve been told that it’s fair to say business as usual until told otherwise.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The United States Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal in a long running case challenging the University of Michigan’s ban on firearms on campus, denying the petition on Monday. 
In Joshua Wade v. University of Michigan, the Michigan Court of Appeals previously ruled that the University’s ban was in line with other policies permitted by the Second Amendment which ban firearms in “sensitive places” like schools. 
According to the University’s brief to the Supreme Court, Wade is neither a student or faculty member, but a private citizen who “spend[s] a lot of time outdoors and in downtown Ann Arbor” and “believe[s] it is [his] constitutional right to carry a weapon on University property,” seeking a waiver to the University’s policy. When his waiver was denied, he sued the university, alleging violations of the Second Amendment and state law.

In petitioning the Supreme Court, Wade’s attorney questioned “whether the Second and Fourteenth Amendments allow a criminal ordinance that prohibits mere possession of firearms on an entire poorly-delineated university campus, except by permission of a single government official with unfettered discretion, which is granted only for ‘extraordinary circumstances,” disputing the Court of Appeals’ classification of all university property as a “sensitive place”.
“The decision of the Court of Appeals, upheld by the Michigan Supreme Court’s denial of appeal, has significant and troubling consequences. By broadly designating the entire university campus as a ‘sensitive place,’ the court effectively nullifies the Second Amendment for thousands of individuals who live, work, or study on or near university property,” Wade’s attorney wrote. “This sweeping prohibition also chills the exercise of the right to bear arms for those who might pass through campus, where the boundary between university property and public space is often indistinguishable.”
The Supreme Court also denied an appeal in another Second Amendment case on Monday, where the State of Minnesota sought to challenge a ruling striking down a law restricting permits to carry a handgun in public to applicants 21 or older, which was upheld by a federal appeals court. 
While another federal appeals court struck down similar age restrictions in Pennsylvania, yet another court upheld the restrictions in Colorado. With similar age restriction cases pending in other jurisdictions, the attorneys for Minnesota argued the Court should either grant its petition, vacate the lower court’s decision and remand the case, or review the lower court’s decision to give direction to the lower courts set to hear these similar cases.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourtoct92024-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-22 11:10:15.486189

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from KCC video)TOPEKA — Stark disagreements on the future of Evergy’s proposal to build two new natural gas plants in Kansas surfaced Monday during opening statements at the beginning of three days of Kansas Corporation Commission hearings.
Evergy announced last fall it would build two natural gas plants in Kansas, in Reno and Sumner counties, citing economic growth in the state that will increase demand. In March, the company announced plans to build a third plant in Missouri. Evergy also is planning a new solar installation in Douglas County.
KCC regulates utilities in Kansas, and the three-person board will determine whether Evergy can move forward with its plans.
Significant opposition to the proposed Kansas natural gas plants is coming from retail customers, who believe the new plants will raise rates and are not necessary to ensure adequate electricity supply. Those organizations are on the docket to speak and filed testimony ahead of time.
In opening remarks, Jim Zakoura, an Overland Park attorney representing multiple industrial and retail businesses, said 99% of retailers who have spoken out are against building the two plants.
“There’s almost no testimony by Evergy in this docket regarding the retail impact on constructing two natural gas facilities, the cost of about $2 billion on 735,000 retail ratepayers in the state of Kansas,” Zakoura said. “Essentially, 99.9% of the retail ratepayers do not support the agreement. Retail ratepayers don’t want the commission to gamble with their hard-earned money.”
Alissa Greenwald, an attorney representing New Energy Economics, expressed concerns that Evergy has understated the risk to customers based on the natural gas fuel price forecast and that viable alternatives, such as investing in battery storage, could help meet capacity needs at a lower cost to customers.
Evergy officials and KCC staff were the two primary entities standing as proponents of the plants.
Evergy attorney Will Wohlford disagreed that both plants weren’t needed and spoke at length about the research and work that goes into the integrated resource planning that Evergy undertakes. Utility companies use IRPs to forecast utility needs and growth in the communities they serve. He explained this docket specifically addresses predetermination of rates for Every Kansas Central, one of Energy’s divisions that would have 100% ownership of the planned solar installation, and 50% of each new natural gas plant.
He also pointed to legislation last year that passed almost unanimously through the Kansas House and Senate that he said supports what Evergy is trying to accomplish.
“This is a resounding public policy pronouncement by the Kansas Legislature in favor of additions of gas facilities for reliability and the use of pre-determination procedures to establish rate treatment for those additions,” he said, referring to House Bill 2527.
Wohlford made a case for the need of the proposed improvements to the Evergy system.
“We know in the last three to four years, we have started to get tight during various weather events, not just Evergy but (the Southwest Power Pool),” Wohlford said. “I would prefer and I think Evergy would prefer to utilize the results of our integrated resource plans and the work that we’ve done and staff have also done an assessment of. This is not the end game. If you look at our IRP, it calls for more resources that we need to consider in 2031 and beyond.”
Some opponents said investing in these plants locks ratepayers into unknown costs and risks, said Carly Masenthin, the lead legal staff for KCC. The regulator’s staff see things differently.
“We’ve made it through our more severe weather periods so far thanks to the efforts made by this commission, our Kansas utilities, the energy industry as a whole in this state, and by importing electricity from our neighboring regions,” she said. “But I think the downside of that success is that it enables taking for granted the fact that the air conditioner and the heat stays on, and perhaps it masks the reality that our success has come by the skin of our teeth for the last four to five years.”
“Even though these plants won’t be online this year or next, staff will sleep easier knowing that Kansans can look forward to additional dispatchable, reliable generation coming on in the near future,” Masenthin added. “Staff urges the commission to find that these plants are needed, that the cost to build them is reasonable and will be well managed, a cost which, again, staff believes will only increase if they are delayed.”
In its long-range plan filed with regulators in 2022, Evergy planned to exclusively add wind and solar facilities over the coming decade. A year later, it scaled back those planned renewable energy facilities, forecasted plans to add natural gas plants and delayed the retirement of the Lawrence coal plant.
Once the plants are online, expected to be in 2029 and 2030, the plants will each add 705 megawatts of power to Evergy’s generation capabilities.
KCC commissioners began hearing testimony in the afternoon, much of which was behind closed doors because of confidential business information being shared by Evergy.
Wohlford was the first person called to testify, and he said he was surprised that opponents were saying the costs of building the plants weren’t included in the information.
“I would suggest that our definitive cost estimate here has the same level of engineering and cost rigor to it than any other predetermination that we brought forward. There certainly are some things we haven’t done yet, because you don’t procure everything and cost everything before the commission weighs in on predetermination,” he said.
Wohlford said costs and information will be consistently updated throughout the projects.
“I think we’re a long way from saying the costs of these projects are unknown,” he said.
Jason Humphrey, Evergy vice president of development, testified before the hearing at the end of the day, discussing the adaptations Evergy made to account for tariffs and other costs that may have increased. It is estimated each plant will cost about $1 billion. Humphrey was asked about the affect of tariffs and the current economy on cost estimates previously submitted.
“Our definitive cost estimates were filed for really an appropriate contingency for this point in the project,” he said. “We do understand the specter of uncertainty that is out there. If we do anticipate costs going over 115% of the definitive cost estimates. At that time, we would have the ability to pause and reevaluate. Our definitive cost estimates today stand, but we wanted a mechanism in place and settlement that if we do see costs rising that we would have the ability to come and talk to parties and the commission about that.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EvergyZakouraScreenshot-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-22 10:03:59.137924

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The federal leader of the Denali Commission said Friday she is trying to save long-planned Alaska infrastructure projects now threatened by the Trump administration — and the life of the independent federal commission itself.
Julie Kitka, who served for three decades as president of the Alaska Federation of Natives before taking on the new role in October as federal co-chair of the Denali Commission, discussed those challenges on Friday in Nome at a conference organized by that city’s government.
“I have to tell you that dealing with the new federal administration, I had a mindset of, ‘This is an administration unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime,’ so that’s proved out,” she said. 
“Too, ‘Urgency is the new normal,’ and that’s proved out,” Kitka said at the City of Nome Investment Summit.
The Denali Commission was founded in 1998 and modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission, which was established in1965. The Denali Commission coordinates rural Alaska infrastructure and economic development planning among multiple agencies, and it disburses grants for various projects, such as water and sewer systems, telecommunications and health care facilities. It gets funding from the federal government, through congressional appropriations and other sources, and it is empowered to receive funding from nongovernmental sources as well.
But now it is jeopardized by the Trump administration’s campaign to dramatically shrink the federal government.
Kitka said she met on Thursday with representatives of the “Department of Government Efficiency,” also known as DOGE, the ad-hoc team led by billionaire Elon Musk that has directed mass firings and deep budget cuts across federal agencies and programs.
Now Kitka said she has three DOGE people assigned to shadow her and the Denali Commission, putting her and her colleagues in the position of defending its existence.
If the Trump administration tries to eliminate the Denali Commission now, it would not be the first time. There were similar attempts in the first Trump administration, but Congress preserved the commission then.
Kitka said one way that she and others are trying to prove the commission’s value is through what she called a “strategic pivot” to emphasize dual use of funded infrastructure projects. Thus, an expanded airport runway or an improved harbor, communication system or health care facility can benefit not only the local and regional community but also the nation’s military forces, which are paying more attention to the Arctic and its role in national defense.
An example of a project that the commission is trying to save with that dual-use pivot is a project to establish climate-resilient telecommunications on the North Slope. The project, led by the Iñupiat Community of the Arctic Slope, a Tribal government, in partnership with the telecommunications company Quintillion, was working its way through a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program.
Though the North Slope project and many others were already in the design and planning phase, the Trump administration in earlier this month terminated the grant program, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC.

	“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters. Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, we are committed to ensuring that Americans in crisis can get the help and resources they need,” an unnamed FEMA spokesperson said in an April 4 statement.
The BRIC program was established during the first Trump administration, and a 2019 report said it saved $6 in costs for every $1 spent. The program awarded grants on a competitive basis, had protocols to ensure that awarded projects were geared at saving people’s lives and required a 25% local or state match. It was expanded during the Biden administration.
Among the BRIC-funded work in Alaska now in jeopardy is a project in Skagway to excavate a rock slope at the city’s port to lessen the risks of landslides and a localized tsunami there. The city was awarded a $19.9 million BRIC grant in February, but the Trump administration’s cancellation of BRIC projects is retroactive to 2020.
Past BRIC grants in Alaska also include $1.465 million awarded in 2022 to the Native Village of Kwigillingok, a Tribal government in a Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta village coping with accelerating erosion, increased flooding and permafrost thaw. It was one of several grants made to tribal governments or Native villages around the nation.
Kitka, in her Nome remarks, said the Denali Commission hopes to convince FEMA that the Utqiagvik telecommunications project and its BRIC funding are worth saving. It can be a “test case” to show how an infrastructure investment can benefit not just the local community but also the military.
There are 16 other pending Alaska projects that are threatened by the decision to axe the BRIC program, she added.
Kitka said another argument to be made to preserve the Denali Commissions is that its role as a coordinating agency, with funding flexibility, is itself a model of efficiency.
Because other federal departments and agencies are able to transfer money to it outside of annual deadlines, the commission can do some multiyear planning, avoiding seasonal problems and delays, she said.
“People have told me that this is the only entity, federal entity, like this in the state of Alaska, that there isn’t any other one like that,” she said. “The downside is we don’t know if it’s going to survive this new administration.”
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also spoke at the Nome conference and addressed concerns about halted or canceled federal funding. “As we are looking to push for new funding, we’ve got to make sure that the funds that we already secured are disbursed,” she said.
Like Kitka, Murkowski said it is important to emphasize Alaska’s role in national security and to make the case that federal investment has national benefits.
That is particularly the case in Nome and the Bering Strait region, which lies at the Pacific gateway to the Arctic Ocean, is involved in Arctic diplomacy and borders Russia, as well as offers the potential for producing important critical minerals, she said.
“We’re looking at Greenland because of national security and mineral and economic security. What’s Nome? Chopped liver?” Murkowski said.
Justifications for the Trump administration’s focus on Greenland can apply to Alaska’s Bering Strait region, she said.
“So let’s make sure that, when we talk about the advantages of having that security on that side of North America, we don’t overlook this side of North America. And, by the way, this side, it is already part of the United States of America,” she said.

House Bill 90, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, seeks to ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and ResX from arranging reservations through their platforms without explicit contracts with restaurants. 
“I’m not preventing the business model from existing,” Hebert said in a phone interview Monday. You just have to have the restaurant’s permission.”
His bill cleared the House Commerce Committee last Wednesday with the unanimous approval of 17 lawmakers, and Hebert said it could come up for a full House vote as early as this week. No one spoke in opposition to the bill at the hearing, and several lawmakers said they’re opposed to the idea of paying for reservations.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey, who lives in Miami, said he intends to speak with lawmakers before the bill goes up for a final vote. 
Founded in 2021, Appointment Trader lets sellers set their own prices for reservations, and bidders can make offers at any price. Additionally, prospective buyers can use the platform as a concierge service, offering a flat fee to anyone who can secure them a reservation at a particular establishment. 
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

Though still relatively new to Louisiana, the Appointment Trader drew attention after the Illuminator reported on its sale of hard-to-get bookings in the New Orleans market during Super Bowl weekend — including a $2,138 reservation at Antoine’s.
Hebert said he sponsored the legislation at the request of the Louisiana Restaurant Association, which argues the sale of reservations without restaurant consent can lead to empty tables, missed opportunities for real customers and diminished service. The LRA modeled Hebert’s bill after legislation New York adopted last year with the backing of major online restaurant booking platforms OpenTable and Resy.
Booking sites let diners reserve tables for free and make money by charging restaurants a fee every time someone books through their apps. Louisiana Restaurant Association president Stan Harris told lawmakers Hebert’s bill would not affect those booking apps “other than actually probably helping protect their business model a little bit.”  
Hebert’s bill calls on the Louisiana attorney general to impose a $1,000 fine against a trading platform for each day a table reservation is offered without a restaurant’s consent. 
Appointment Trader is actively trying to partner with restaurants, its founder Frey said, offering them half of the final bid proceeds for each reservation.
If the bill clears the House floor, it will next head to the Senate for consideration.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)The number of intensely segregated school sites in the Twin Cities has grown almost five-fold, from 21 to over 100, since the turn of the century, according to University of Minnesota researcher Will Stancil.
If enacted, HF2899 would fund incentives for districts to integrate schools within their boundaries, as well as participate in programs to bus students across district lines to reduce segregation between school districts.
The bill would also create a system of four magnet schools open to students in the metro. Additional state funding would go toward transportation costs for the three integration programs.
A hodgepodge of other proposals are included, like more money for summer school; new data reporting requirements for districts participating in the integration programs and an on-campus summer credit recovery pilot with the University of Minnesota for high school students behind on credits to graduate.
A work group led by Minnesota Education Equity Partnership joined with bill author Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, to craft the bill over the past year. The group included two attorneys — Daniel Shulman and Myron Orfield — who have spent over three decades advocating for desegregation, including a single, metro-wide school district to promote racial and economic integration of Twin Cities public schools.
The bill is intended as a vehicle for community engagement as well as a placeholder for a potential settlement of the Cruz-Guzman lawsuit, first filed by Shulman in 2015 on behalf of a group of parents against the Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts and the state of Minnesota.
The parents allege that the de facto economic and racial segregation of Minneapolis and St. Paul schools violates the Minnesota Constitution, which guarantees a uniform and adequate education. Whether the court finds in favor of the plaintiffs, or if a settlement is reached, any changes to state law — including additional funding for schools — would need legislative action to be implemented.
The bill’s proposals echo previous attempts to integrate Twin Cities public schools. In 2001, the Choice is Yours program, in which the state paid to bus low-income Minneapolis students to suburban school districts, came out of a settlement from a similar lawsuit, also filed by Shulman. That program also created inter-district magnet schools through the West Metro Education Program and the East Metro Education Program.
Minneapolis Public Schools changed its school assignment policies, school attendance boundaries and magnet programs in 2021 — partially in response to the Cruz-Guzman lawsuit — in an attempt to draw the district’s wealthy students into magnet programs in schools that had previously served primarily low-income students of color.
The changes have largely failed to create integrated magnet schools, and last year the district removed almost all of its additional financial support to help the magnet schools succeed.
In other respects, the proposals in Frazier’s bill differ from earlier attempts at desegregation. The focus is now on balancing the economic status of students within schools, rather than relying on race. The state would also provide additional revenue for districts that participate in the various integration programs, not just transportation aid.
Unlike Choice is Yours, which only bussed low-income Minneapolis students out of the district, the bill would also pay to bus high-income students to schools serving primarily low-income students.
Charter schools would also be eligible to participate in the integration programs.
The bill has been referred to the House Education Policy Committee but it has not yet had a committee hearing.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-74-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

Nancy Mace talks to Harley Hicks, a transgender student at the University of South Carolina, at an event held by the school's Turning Point USA chapter on Monday, April 21, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/South Carolina Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Following a contentious exchange with a college campus audience, U.S. Rep Nancy Mace doubled down on offensive language toward a transgender student and then posted a video of the interaction on social media.
After approaching the stage, University of South Carolina student Harley Hicks, who uses she/they pronouns, asked Mace to apologize for using the word “tranny.”
Is that “derogatory to you?” Mace asked after a speaking event hosted by USC’s chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative viewpoints on high school and college campuses across the country.
“Well, yeah. Of course it f—ing is,” Hicks responded.
Mace, who’s considering a run for governor in 2026, then repeated the word three times, as seen in the video she posted on X.
After the interaction, Hicks grabbed a potted plant, which Mace said her security team thought Hicks was going to throw at her. Mace repeated the claim on a Fox News appearance after the event.
Talking to a pair of reporters, the 20-year-old student denied that claim.
“I’m like a shark, more afraid of her than she is of me,” said Hicks, who added that being at the event as a trans person was one of the bravest actions she’d ever taken.
“If I were attacking her, you’d have seen a very different video,” Hicks said.
About 60 people attended the roughly 35-minute event at USC’s student life center.
It quickly devolved into a question-and-answer session as people in the audience interrupted Mace’s speech by shouting questions about immigration, abortion, student loans, and her repeated use of the phrase “lunatic left” to describe Democrats.
Monday’s interaction comes after multiple controversies between Mace and trans people.
In February, the 1st District congresswoman was criticized for using the same offensive language she used with Hicks during a House Oversight Committee hearing on spending by the United States Agency for International Development, known as USAID, which the Trump administration has halted.
Mace accused USAID of “funding some of the dumbest, I mean stupidest, just dumbest initiatives imaginable, all supported by the left,” citing a list of diversity and transgender advocacy initiatives funded around the world.
Following the election of Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress in November, Mace led the charge to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms in the U.S. Capitol and House office buildings. House Speaker Mike Johnson then issued a rule that “all single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex.”
Mace then introduced legislation to expand the rule to all federal buildings, as well as a separate bill applying the rule to restrooms nationwide.
The 47-year-old congresswoman didn’t mention McBride by name but alluded to her at Monday’s event.
“I was the first woman last year in Congress when we had somebody who was elected, who was a biological male dressed as a woman, who decided this isn’t going to happen in the United States,” Mace said.
“It’s not going to happen in South Carolina. It’s not going to happen anywhere, if I decide to put a stop to it,” she added.
Over the weekend, an interaction between the congresswoman and Ely Murray-Quick at an Ulta Beauty store went viral after both the constituent and Mace posted video from their perspective.
Murray-Quick questioned Mace about not holding any in-person town halls, something she has been consistently criticized for in recent weeks. By the end of the video, both Mace and Murray-Quick had traded curse words.
The congresswoman has pointed to threats against her and staffers as the reason there has yet to be an in-person town hall in 2025. On April 8, she held a telephone town hall without advance notice or promotion.
Mace was the first to curse in the video that’s pinned to the top of her X profile. When asked by a pair of female reporters ahead of the event why she started cursing and if that behavior was appropriate for a member of Congress, Mace criticized them.
“To shame a woman for standing up for herself is completely ridiculous. That’s what you’re doing. You’re shaming a woman for standing up for herself,” she said. “Either of you, how do you think that makes other women feel?”
Minutes later, Mace took the stage and told the crowd that she had to “call out the insanity” with reporters who “were offended that an adult female used a curse word.”
“I’m like, have you seen my interviews?” she said.
It only took four minutes before Mace’s speech was interrupted by people in the audience.
When asked about mass deportations of immigrants without proper authorization, Mace said, “We did it under Obama, we did it under Biden, we did it under Bush and beyond. If it was good enough for all of those presidents then, it’s good enough for Trump today.”
When asked if it was necessary for immigrants to receive due process with judicial proceedings, Mace said “they didn’t have due process on the way in, they shouldn’t get it on the way out.”
Her take received a mix of cheers and yells from an outraged crowd.
While the event was held by a conservative group, the most vocal members of the audience disagreed with Mace. One even asked if her faith in God is genuine.
“Yes, I went to church yesterday,” Mace said.
Mace has publicly said she’s mulling a run for governor.
Others publicly considering a bid include Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Gov. Pam Evette and U.S. Rep Ralph Norman, as well as state Senators Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett.
Holly Sox, a 58-year-old Gilbert resident, was among the attendees Monday.
Though a lifelong Republican, she said she started voting for Democrats last year due to the rhetoric of Mace and the Make America Great Again movement.
“This MAGA crowd has corrupted and co-opted what I grew up believing,” said Sox, who was wearing a shirt with the face of U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, who Mace has sparred with.
The final question of the event came from a self-identified Democrat, who asked how Democrats can trust that Mace will have a real conversation with people she’s labeled part of the “lunatic left.” When the congresswoman said she’ll have a conversation with anyone, the person followed by asking if that extends to the trans community.
“It applies to everybody,” she said. “But I’m not going to allow some guy in a skirt to be in my bathroom or in my locker room undressed.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5537-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 10:03:59.137924

(Courtesy of Travis Entenman)My recent trip to Washington, D.C., sponsored by United Today, Stronger Tomorrow (UTST), was a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when community members unite to educate decisionmakers about the priorities they’ve identified as most important back at home. Alongside 40 mostly rural and remote leaders from a broad range of organizations, sectors, and elected offices across eight states, we brought critical issues to the forefront by sharing specific, data-supported, real-world impacts of freezing, cutting, or clawing back federal investments in our communities. Together, we were able to lift up rural and remote voices in the halls of power.
Northern Prairies Land Trust (NPLT) has long championed conservation efforts across South Dakota. Our work preserving grasslands and advocating for farmers and ranchers aligns perfectly with UTST’s own commitment to developing grassroots leaders to advocate on their own behalf for priorities that they’ve identified. In half-a-dozen meetings, we emphasized the urgent need to address the U.S. Department of Agriculture funding freeze, which is jeopardizing vital conservation programs and leaving producers without promised resources.
Funding freezes and staff cuts pull the rug out from under farmers

The USDA funding freeze has placed farmers in an untenable position, with many struggling to cover costs for projects initiated under programs like the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). As I’ve noted in recent writings, this freeze undermines an already fragile trust between producers and government agencies. Farmers and ranchers who have invested in fencing, cover crops, and renewable energy systems are now left uncertain about their financial futures. Our advocacy aimed to restore that trust by educating policymakers about the dire consequences of interrupting these federal investments, choosing not to honor existing contracts, or refusing to release funds critical to sustaining rural and remote economies.
While streamlining the federal government is a valid goal, it should not come at the expense of rural and remote communities and the environment. We need targeted solutions that address inefficiencies without jeopardizing vital conservation programs. During my meetings with our members of Congress, I emphasized the need for a more nuanced approach that considers the unique needs of agricultural communities. Their reactions, both positive and surprised, emphasized the importance of flying “experts from the field” to Washington, D.C., to share, face-to-face, the fruits of our experiences “on the ground.”
The USDA’s actions threaten the progress we have made in promoting regenerative agriculture and conservation. It is imperative that we reverse these harmful cuts and ensure that farmers have the resources they need to protect our land and water. My conversations in Washington underscored the urgency of this issue, and I urge policymakers to prioritize the needs of our agricultural communities.
Despite these challenges, our meetings with lawmakers were encouraging. Our members of Congress expressed a willingness to explore solutions that would restore funding and support farmers who have already invested in conservation projects. The discussions highlighted the importance of organizations like NPLT and UTST in bridging the gap between local needs and federal policy. These moments of collaboration underscored a shared commitment to protecting both agricultural livelihoods and natural resources.
As we move forward, it is clear that unity, education, and advocacy are key to overcoming challenges like the USDA funding freeze. The positivity and progress from our meetings in Washington give hope that solutions are within reach. In fact, this week, UTST will join local farmers, community organizations, and health centers for the South Dakota Stronger Tomorrow Rural Bus Tour with members of Congress who are home on recess. This time, the policymakers will be on our turf, and I anticipate it will result in an even deeper understanding of the unique challenges and opportunities federal investments can manifest in South Dakota. What’s certain is that together with partners like UTST, we will continue to champion producers, conservationists, and rural and remote communities — proving that united efforts today truly lead to a stronger tomorrow.

Special education advocates and educators in California are raising red flags over President Donald Trump’s dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and how it would affect some of California’s most vulnerable students.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, nearly 800,000 K-12 California students, or 14%, are enrolled in special education. Last year the state spent roughly $13 billion on special education, with the federal government covering about 10%. 
In his push to shutdown the federal education department, Trump is slashing its workforce by half, and in March he said he plans to move special education oversight to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — itself undergoing a more than 20% reduction in workforce.
Trump has also threatened to pull federal funding for schools to states, including California, that do not comply with his orders to terminate diversity efforts or to limit protections for transgender students. 
At the same time, while Congress left special education funding intact in the most recently passed budget, its GOP members are considering deep cuts to Medicaid as they seek to maintain 2017 tax cuts that primarily benefit the rich. 
Medicaid helps school districts pay for speech and occupational therapy, as well as mental health services for students with disabilities. Regional centers in California, which are partly funded by Medicaid, also provide parents with disabled children diagnoses, medical equipment such as wheelchairs and other services.
Any federal cuts or changes to special education could have a major effect on the community and jeopardize the safety of students and staff, according to some special education experts. For Gina Gandolfi, a former special education teacher in San Bernardino County, she worries whether Trump’s changes would disrupt the services her son receives. Nathan, who is a ten-year-old with Down syndrome, receives speech and occupational therapy and one-to-one classroom support. 

Gandolfi: “The disability community has fought hard for where we are now. What if those services are taken away? Kids with disabilities will go back to being second-class students.”

Could CA Republicans regain the governorship?

As Democratic candidates for California’s crowded 2026 gubernatorial race wait in anticipation for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether she’ll throw her hat in the ring, Republican candidates seek to become the state’s first GOP governor in more than a decade, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
Despite an overwhelmingly Democratic populace, California Republicans have some reason to be optimistic: In November they flipped three seats in the state Legislature, and Trump increased his vote share in nearly every county. Two of the more high-profile GOP candidates for California’s highest elected office are Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News host Steve Hilton, who joined the race Monday. 
Both candidates want to eliminate the state income tax and roll back environmental regulations. They are also vocal Trump supporters who argue that California is faring worse under the Democratic party’s policies on crime, homelessness and the economy.

Bianco, to CalMatters: “We are being led down a path of complete government control and socialism. This is no longer Democrat versus Republican. We’re at a point where it’s sane versus insane.”


Hilton, to CalMatters: “I don’t think there’s any other way of describing California today, other than the sick man of America. It’s just undeniable that we’re in a terrible, terrible mess in California and we have to change direction.”

Homeowners sue insurance companies

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California homeowners sued the state’s biggest insurance companies late Friday, saying the companies conspired to cancel policyholders and caused them to be under-insured after the Los Angeles County fires. 
The lawsuits, brought by two law firms on behalf of homeowners, name State Farm, Farmers, 21st Century and other insurers as plaintiffs accused of violating the state’s antitrust and unfair practice laws. The plaintiffs allege the “group boycott” by the insurers drove Californians to the FAIR Plan, the insurer of last resort — which is run by an association of the same insurers. The plan, which offers less coverage but higher prices than other policies, essentially shifted financial risk to homeowners, the lawsuits say. 
One lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of all FAIR Plan customers. The other was filed on behalf of some families that had FAIR Plan policies when their homes burned down in the recent L.A.-area fires.
The suits say the coordination was made possible through meetings among the FAIR Plan board and two industry groups. Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, called it “an outrageous lie that distracts from the well-known state policies that predictably caused, and continue to cause, the market problems.” The other group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, did not immediately return a request for comment.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Though Trump’s tariffs might make California’s economy worse, the state’s film, tech and agricultural industries have already been struggling.
To achieve California’s clean energy goals, its lawmakers must pass a bill that would help make it easier to build more solar and wind projects in the North American West, writes Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program.

By assessing a flat rate as well as additional per capita fees on social media platforms with over 100,000 monthly users, SF3197 would raise an estimated $137 million in 2026-27 from the 14 largest platforms operating in Minnesota. 
Here’s why the data mining tax is a good idea
Like efforts to curtail multinational corporate tax avoidance in 2023, this is an important and innovative idea that would once again make Minnesota a national leader in creating a stronger and more equitable tax code. 
Democratic lawmakers registered enthusiastic support during initial hearings, with pointed criticisms of an exploitative industry. House Ways and Means Chair Zack Stephenson, DFL-Coon Rapids, and Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, likened the data mining tax to taxes on smoking and mineral extraction, respectively. Hauschild went so far as to describe social media platforms as leeches, and he’s not off base.
In 2024, for example, Meta made $62 billion in after-tax profits on $164 billion in revenue for an astounding 42% profit margin. Out of $69 billion in net revenue, they paid just $8.3 billion in taxes for an effective tax rate of 12%. 
These earnings don’t result from new value or innovation in the traditional sense, but from attention-seeking business models that create addictive behavior among users while generating few jobs and little in socially productive economic activity. 
Multiple scientific studies have found social media use is strongly associated with increased rates of mental health challenges like depression, anxiety and disordered eating, especially among children and adolescents. 
Social media advertising models have also contributed to the degradation of our information ecosystem, which is an essential pillar of democracy. The southwest Metro and southeastern Minnesota lost 10 local newspapers last April alone, all replaced with nothing other than Facebook rage and viral conspiracy theories. 
In my testimony on the bill, I explained how the policy could be described as a Pigouvian tax — a tax levied on a socially harmful activity in hopes of reducing its prevalence and/or raising revenue to compensate for its deleterious effects. Big tech is increasingly leveraging in-depth user knowledge to extract maximum profit. To allow these practices to proliferate with minimal regulation is bad enough, but to do so without any fiscal compensation is simply foolish. 
A tax on data mining is especially important in the case of social media platforms because they offer their services for free, in exchange for access to consumer data, which is then monetized through the sale of advertising. 
Economists describe this as a barter — you give them lots of data about yourself, and in exchange they let you scroll for free — and policy experts have written on the importance of taxing such transactions, both to discourage the rampant acceleration of hidden extraction, and so that the public can benefit from growing industries in which traditional monetary transactions don’t occur.
To put it in simple terms: The Zucks of the world are enriching themselves by pumping us full of free content that comes with high hidden costs. The new tax would act as a limiter, or at least a compensator, for those hidden costs. 

Similar to the discussion around sales tax exemptions, there is a fairness argument for businesses here as well. According to the Department of Revenue, businesses pay nearly half of all state sales taxes, but not all industries incur the same sales tax liabilities. White collar and other intangible services are generally not subject to sales taxes while many tangible goods are. 
A parallel pattern plays out in the broader economy: If growing online industries generate substantial profit based on the value of consumer data, but consumer data is not taxable, then these industries have an inherent advantage over others, even if those others provide more socially productive goods and services. 
That’s a lot of reasons to celebrate. 
Here’s the bad news
None of these arguments will persuade influential business groups to support the idea. With an evenly split House, any tax increase will face a difficult path to becoming law. 
Initial objections by the business-funded Council on State Taxation follow a familiar pattern — using legalese and overly complex language to grant an air of authority to their arguments that boil down more simply to “our wealthy funders don’t want to pay taxes.” But while many of these points are in bad faith, Minnesota would be the first state to pass this policy, and there are implementation questions as well as a guarantee of court challenges, which have arisen over similar policies in Maryland. 
Legal challenges will arise, not because it is illegal or unjustified, but because large tech firms have the money and incentive to fight tooth and nail against any new tax. This is what happened with digital ad taxes in Maryland, but advocates there have cleared significant hurdles, and the state is collecting tax revenue in the meantime. There’s something deeply undemocratic about this strategy of legal obstruction, and Minnesota shouldn’t be deterred. 
As bad news goes, that’s not the worst. 
Here’s where it gets ugly
The data mining tax, though certainly worthwhile, is the result of a politics that sees taxes as a punishment that should be heaped only on the wicked. I am all for taxing extractive practices, but those sorts of policies won’t get us anywhere near the revenues we need to avoid looming cuts to education and disability services, let alone mitigate the damage wrought by impending federal budget cuts. The real revenues we need will require raising taxes on a larger swath of Minnesota residents and businesses — something politicians on both sides of the aisle are very reluctant to do.
In tax policy circles, there’s a phrase used to describe this dynamic. “Don’t tax me, don’t tax thee; tax the man behind the tree!” In other words, everyone wants a tax that raises revenue from someone else. And that’s the exact sort of thinking we are seeing here, as fingers point to a handful of large companies with poor reputations that are nowhere near the primary culprits of our top heavy economy.
In New York, for example, a similar bill created a rate and fee structure much the same as this one, but applied it to all data collection, not just that by social media platforms. That policy design brought in banks, credit card companies, cell phone providers, and more. That would raise considerably more revenue and much more meaningfully crack down on unfettered data collection as a business model. But it would seem that even those major industries didn’t make for a clear enough villain for Minnesota legislators this time around.
Furthermore, and somewhat ironically, some of the same senators that railed impressively against social media platforms are also moving to potentially expand tax breaks for data centers run by some of the very same companies impacted by the social media data mining tax. I think they mean well, and I can understand the desire to attract new high-paying jobs. But the contrast reveals that we are still in need of a deeper attitude adjustment around taxes.
Taxing online enterprises is essential to the state’s long-term budgetary stability, so I am glad we are starting the conversation. In a bad budget year, it’s refreshing to see legislators fighting to make more profitable corporations pay their fair share. 
But this policy is not on par with our revenue needs. We can’t just find someone we don’t like and tax them. We have to agree to tax ourselves because it’s the only way to create a more effective government and humane society moving forward.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/socialmedia-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

Is there a Republican who can finally win statewide in California again?,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/04/republican-governor-race-2026/,Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco lead the field of Republicans who hope to snap a long GOP losing streak in next year's California governor's race.,"In summary
Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco lead the field of Republicans who hope to snap a long GOP losing streak in next year’s California governor’s race.


After more than a decade being exiled from the governor’s office in California, Republicans are eyeing growing voter frustration with the dominant liberal politics of the state as a launching pad for a comeback next year.
Though lacking the statewide profiles of a deluge of Democratic contenders, a pair of GOP hopefuls with devoted conservative followings has jumped into the open 2026 gubernatorial race in recent months, hoping to persuade voters that only a radical shakeup can fix California’s problems.
“I don’t think there’s any other way of describing California today, other than the sick man of America,” said Steve Hilton, a former Fox News host and onetime political adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron who officially announced his candidacy on Monday. “It’s just undeniable that we’re in a terrible, terrible mess in California and we have to change direction.”
Hilton is kicking off his campaign today with an event in Huntington Beach, the city that has remade itself over the past few years into the bulwark of conservative resistance in California. He follows Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a hero of the right for defying state mandates during the COVID pandemic, who entered the race to succeed termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom in February.
Both believe that voters have grown sick of a generation of one-party Democratic rule in Sacramento and are banking on appeals to cut taxes and regulations — which they blame for making California unaffordable — to reach across traditional partisan lines.
“We are being led down a path of complete government control and socialism,” Bianco said in an interview. “This is no longer Democrat versus Republican. We’re at a point where it’s sane versus insane.”
But conservative candidates face a steep climb in a state that has not elected a Republican to statewide office since Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won a second term in 2006.
California Democratic Party Chairperson Rusty Hicks said the gubernatorial race is about more than just who can deliver for Californians. Voters know the governor has a powerful platform to stand up to the Trump administration and they won’t want a Republican in a role that is also critical to the future of the rest of the country and the whole world, he said.
“I certainly applaud them for continuing to try,” Hicks said. “But time and time again, we see California voters see their policies for what they are, which is not in line with the values of Californians.”
Slashing taxes and regulations
More than 20 people have already filed a statement of intention to run for governor in the 2026 primary as Republicans — though few will be serious candidates and some may never qualify for the ballot at all, which requires paying a filing fee or submitting thousands of signatures from registered voters.
Only two, including Bianco, have reported raising any money for their campaigns so far. While the first fundraising report of 2025 is not due until the end of July, major donations are filed with the state on a rolling basis.
Leo Zacky, a poultry farm heir and perennial candidate who received 1.3% of the vote in the 2022 gubernatorial primary and 0.1% in the 2021 recall election, seeded his campaign last month with $50,000 of his own money.
Meanwhile, since launching his campaign in February, Bianco has reported more than $380,000 in major contributions — enough to solidify himself as an early frontrunner for conservative voters, but a far cry from the millions that some Democratic contenders have already raised.
That leaves an opening for Hilton, 55, a native of the United Kingdom who moved to California in 2012 with his wife, a public relations executive for tech companies. Hilton has a built-in audience from hosting the weekly commentary program “The Next Revolution” on Fox News from 2017 to 2023, and Silicon Valley connections that could provide the money he needs to spread his message more broadly.
Hilton said his campaign will focus on practical solutions to rebuild a “ladder of opportunity,” so that every Californian can have a great job and a great home — though many of them are ideas that the Democratic supermajority in the Legislature is unlikely to ever support.
He would eliminate the state income tax for Californians below an unspecified income level. He wants to boost housing development by simplifying building codes, ending lawsuits under the infamous California Environmental Quality Act, and promoting construction of single-family homes. He believes the state needs mandatory phonics education and more accountability for teachers based on test scores to improve student achievement.
Though he has had a long career in politics, Hilton has never held elected office himself, which he argues is an asset.
“I would ask people, how good are the machine politicians in Sacramento who are involved in this one-party rule? How is that working?” Hilton said.
Bianco, 57, was a longtime sheriff’s deputy in Riverside County who ran for sheriff in 2018 out of frustration with what he called a “pro-criminal” approach to public safety in California. During his two terms as chief law enforcement officer of Riverside County, he has been a controversial but locally popular figure, refusing to enforce Newsom’s COVID lockdown orders or apologize for his brief affiliation with the far-right Oath Keepers militia.

He said he’s now running for governor because, like many Californians, he is tired of how the government has failed a state that people otherwise love. Many of his priorities align with Hilton’s: Bianco would like to completely abolish the state income tax, get rid of laws that he said are driving farmers and ranchers out of business, and leave environmental regulation to the federal government.
And echoing the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, Bianco said he wants to eliminate wasteful spending such as the high-speed rail project and multibillion-dollar programs that have not reduced homelessness.
“The number one job of government is public safety,” Bianco said. “All the rest of it is fluff.”
The anti-Trump bump
California Republicans have been jubilant since the November election, when they flipped three seats in the state Legislature as President Donald Trump increased his vote share in nearly every county. At a party convention in Sacramento last month, they strategized over how to build on the momentum by leaning into issues such as affordability and crime that appear to be helping them gain ground, particularly among Latino voters.
“That tells us that Californians, on the local level and when it comes to the laws that are being passed in Sacramento, they’re looking to Republicans,” Corrine Rankin, the newly elected chairperson of the California Republican Party, said in an interview. “They’re rejecting the failures that are coming out of the Capitol by the Democrats.”
In a February survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, only 48% of likely voters said the state is going in the right direction, compared to 51% who said it’s going in the wrong direction — underwater, albeit the highest approval in two years.
To win the governorship next year, Rankin said the state GOP would eventually unite behind a candidate who can help Californians understand how that dissatisfaction is driven by what Democrats in charge of the state are doing.
“We need change here in California. Californians expect change and we’re positioned to deliver,” she said.
But the modest advances of the last election belie a GOP that is still far from competitive in California. Trump only received about 38% of the vote, losing to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by more than 20 percentage points, and Republicans lost three U.S. House seats.
The 2026 midterms, in which Democratic anger at the Trump administration could produce an even more liberal electorate, will be a difficult political environment for the California GOP to snap a statewide shutout that dates back to 2010. In 2022, no Republican candidate for statewide office came within 10 percentage points of victory, and most lost by about twice that margin.
Andrew Acosta, a Democratic political consultant who is not working on the governor’s race, said there are substantive problems in California for serious conservatives to campaign on. “The Republicans have a lot of fodder if they did it the right way,” he said.
But candidates so closely tied to Trump are unlikely to overcome the deep anti-Trump sentiment in the electorate and win the governorship next year, Acosta added. “There’s zero chance of these Republicans.”
Both Hilton and Bianco are vocal Trump supporters. Hilton’s campaign even references the MAGA movement with a “make California golden again” slogan, and he rolled out an endorsement on the first day from Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the architects of Trump’s DOGE initiative.
Though some Democratic candidates are already tapping into the fury at Trump to fuel their campaigns, Hilton said the focus is misplaced.
“None of that helps a single person in California,” he said. “These are real issues. So if Democrat candidates want to deflect from that and become national political commentators, then good luck with that.”
Bianco said Democrats have done “outstanding psychological warfare” for decades convincing people that Republicans cannot win in California, which has suppressed conservative participation in elections. But things have finally gotten so bad, he said, that those frustrated voters will turn out next year and elect a Republican governor.
“We can’t blame Donald Trump. Donald Trump doesn’t have anything to do with California and the laws that have been passed in the past 20 years,” he said. “I believe that the majority of people, of hard-working Californians, have conservative leanings.”

Santa Monica College started the first community college program to train people for much-needed jobs in homeless services. But will its first cohort be its last?


With more than 187,000 people sleeping on California’s streets and in its shelters, the state’s homeless services industry is struggling to hire enough qualified workers to help them. 
Last year, Santa Monica College set out to fix that: It heralded the state’s first-ever community college program aimed at training the next generation of homeless service workers. But the program has fallen victim to many of the same challenges that have long stymied progress on homelessness in California, including unreliable funding, high attrition rates and political turmoil. 
In fact, it’s not clear if the much-needed program will persist. 
“We know the value added when somebody is adequately trained before they’re deployed,” said Vanessa Rios, a senior advisor for workforce development with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, which funds the community college program. “It would be a disservice to our system should we not fund and support this effort. Where the dollars (will) come from, I don’t know.”
It’s the front-line jobs, where staff interact face-to-face with unhoused clients, that often are the most difficult for agencies to fill or keep filled. That includes doing outreach in encampments, staffing homeless shelters, and working as a case manager trying to find permanent housing for clients. 
More than 8,000 people worked in the homeless services sector in Los Angeles County in 2022, a report by consulting firm KPMG and United Way of Greater Los Angeles found. But the county still had more than 1,300 open positions and would need more than 2,200 workers on top of that — so, more than 11,500 altogether — to meet the needs of Los Angeles County’s homeless population. 
Even compared to other major U.S. cities such as Atlanta, Chicago or Houston, homeless service workers in Los Angeles have a higher turnover rate, according to a more recent KPMG report. 
It’s an issue all over the state. Most nonprofits that provide homeless services in California can’t help everyone who asks, in part because they struggle to recruit and retain staff, according to a 2024 study by the UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
The new community college program was supposed to fill those holes by giving students the specific skills they need to succeed in homeless services. But amid perennial state budget uncertainty and questions about the region’s homeless services, Rios couldn’t say if her team will be able to fund another round of students at Santa Monica College. 
The state’s Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention fund initially supported the program with roughly $750,000. That fund is the main source of flexible money that California cities and counties use to combat homelessness. Once the $750,000 runs out, it’s not clear whether it will be renewed. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget, released in January, did not include any new money for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention, although the Legislature could still add some.
That uncertainty is a major problem. For years, nonprofits, cities and counties have said a lack of consistent state funding hampers their ability to fight homelessness. While Newsom has poured billions into the cause, it has largely been in one-time grants — not the predictable, ongoing funding that service providers say they need in order to plan long-term programs.
At the same time, the agency that funds the community college program is in crisis. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority — a joint agency of the city and county of LA — has all but imploded. Earlier this month, the LA County Board of Supervisors voted to pull its money out of the joint agency, following a scathing audit of its work. Three days later, the head of the agency said she would resign. Now,  the city is considering pulling out as well.

“We’re hopeful that we’re able to secure funding in the future,” said Patricia Ramos, dean of academic affairs for Santa Monica College. “But nothing is guaranteed.” 
Rios said her team is looking for additional money to support the college program, including from the state and philanthropic partners. If the community college program does continue, it wouldn’t accept another class of students until spring of 2026. 
‘Can I do this?’
When Tamyra Simpson saw a LinkedIn advertisement about the Santa Monica College program, she thought it was “too good to be true.”
Growing up, her grandmother, a substance use counselor, would pick up Simpson at her childhood home in Pasadena and travel to Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles, where they’d serve food to homeless people on Thanksgiving. 
“The women in my family, they’ve always been service-oriented,” she said. 
Simpson works as a nanny in the wealthy Los Feliz neighborhood near downtown Los Angeles, but said her goal is to eventually work in homeless services. 
She was one of about 70 people who applied for admission into the inaugural Santa Monica College homelessness services program, and one of just 27 students who were ultimately selected, said Steven Sedky, who oversees the program. Students take multiple courses over the span of two semesters, where they learn about the history of homeless services, effective practices to help homeless clients, and even strategies to avoid burnout. The program culminates in a paid internship at a relevant nonprofit or agency in Los Angeles County.

Only about half of the students are left, Sedky said — an attrition rate “much higher than we initially anticipated.” 
Students dropped out for a variety of reasons, he said. One student lost housing, while other students struggled with the commute to class, which includes in-person meetings on Wednesdays. 
On Wednesday mornings, Simpson starts her nanny job at 7 am. Then, around 8 am, she begins the hour drive to Santa Monica. If traffic is bad, it can take up to an hour and a half. After class, a little after noon,  she drives back to Los Feliz and works another five hours  as a nanny. 
“I really ask myself, ‘Can I do this?’” she said. “But there’s so much value in this program, this experience. I don’t think I would have changed anything if I could.” 
After she graduates in June, she’ll face a job market rife with its own challenges. An entry-level position at LA-based homeless services nonprofit The People Concern, for example, typically pays between $21 and $25 an hour, said CEO John Maceri. Simpson said she makes about twice that much working as a nanny. 
“LA is an expensive place to live,” Maceri said. “It’s hard to survive.”
 “This sector does not pay livable wages unless you’re in senior management,” said Celina Alvarez, executive director of Housing Works. She helped create the Santa Monica College program and teaches a class there. “We’ve got to do better by (the workers). They are first responders. They don’t even have access to mental health support, considering they experience and witness a tremendous amount of human suffering on a daily basis.” 
Alvarez said between 10 and 15 of the 73 total jobs at her organization are vacant. 
At The People Concern, which will host two Santa Monica College students as interns, about 85 jobs are open — about 10% of their total positions. Once the interns complete the program, Maceri said his organization would be happy to hire them.
“The quality of the work is only as good as the quality of the people doing the work,” he said. “And we need more folks in the homelessness response system workforce.”
A difficult job
Low pay isn’t the only thing that makes people wary of jumping into a career in homeless services. The work is extremely grueling and difficult. Burnout is common. A lack of resources makes everything worse. Workers can try their best to help someone, but if there are no shelter beds or housing available, they can’t do much. That can be very frustrating, Maceri said. 
“Sometimes people have a fantasy of what the work is like, and then get into it and realize ‘Oh, this is different than what I thought,’” he said. “I think most people want to help, but the intensity of the work day in and day out is a lot to handle.”
A lack of adequate training makes it even harder, as workers may not know how to respond to the specific challenges they encounter in the field. Alvarez gave an example of a newly hired case manager at her organization: The case manager went to a client’s house to pick up the client for a psychiatric appointment. Before they left, the client injected themself with an unknown substance. The big-hearted case manager didn’t know what the client had injected but took them to their appointment anyway — a dangerous move that could have ended with the client becoming aggressive or even overdosing in the caseworker’s car, Alvarez said. 
Existing degree programs don’t train workers for the realities of what they’ll face in the field, such as navigating the bureaucracy of hospitals and nursing homes, or how to reunite a homeless individual with family, Rios said.
The program also tries to prepare students for burnout, by providing counselors who debrief with students after they go out in the field, and teach them techniques to cope with what they see.

But there are some intractable problems this training program can’t fix. 
For social workers, who have a master’s degree, it’s more lucrative to work as a therapist in private practice. Even other low-paying industries, such as child welfare, offer special grants or fellowships. In Los Angeles, the county’s decision to gut the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority makes it even harder for graduates to imagine this industry as a stable career choice.  
Still, as a current student, Simpson is hopeful that the community college program will continue.

Clean. Reliable. Affordable. Those are the challenging but achievable goals for California’s electric grid. 
To affordably and reliably get the clean energy required to run a state as populous and prosperous as California, we have to build. We must build all of the rooftop renewables that we can. We need to build unprecedented amounts of new solar and battery storage at big power plants throughout California. And we must import significant quantities of renewable energy from other states to fill the gaps. 
We need all three. And the third means renewed and deeper collaboration with our energy partners across the West.  
State Sen. Josh Becker’s proposal, Senate Bill 540, represents the carefully considered path to achieving that partnership. SB 540 continues the march started by several western energy officials who proposed a new independently governed entity offering an expansive suite of wholesale electricity market functions across the largest possible footprint. Making a market that spans the North American West is fundamental to providing a roadmap for solar and wind projects to get built, helping fill the gaps left by our transformative buildout of clean energy in California.
SB 540 is also critical to enabling California’s participation in that market, and ensures our state has a leadership role since other competing market concepts are less likely to share the commitment to our clean energy goals. 
During a 2020 heat wave, California’s grid operator was forced to institute rotating outages, a necessary step to protect the grid in California and neighboring states. Gov. Gavin Newsom led a careful multi-agency after-action analysis, identified causes and made changes to market design. The state began accelerating the deployment of batteries to help stabilize the grid.
When the next heat wave occurred in 2022, these changes brought positive results. But it was still a close call. During extreme heat last year, the grid remained stable as the solutions had progressed even further. 
We cannot afford to rest on this success. 
Heat waves and related emergencies highlight the challenges of decarbonizing a grid as large as California’s amid ever-worsening climate change. Unfortunately, we need to redouble our efforts because climate change is going to get worse even as we become more dependent on renewable energy resources that do not produce energy at all times. 
SB 540 will allow us to rely on our neighbors in a pinch, and allow them to rely on us as well. This bill is a key next step. 
This is nothing new. Since the Pat Brown era, California has always collaborated in securing its electricity. The transformation we are leading — with our pathbreaking commitment to clean electricity, commitment to electric vehicles and broader goal of demonstrating what a prosperous, opportunity-creating clean energy economy can look like — requires a renewed focus on interstate institutions and structures that have shaped our modern energy reality in ways that may be hard to see. They are taken for granted. 
As the Western Interstate Energy Board brings together stakeholders in California and other states to continue a west-wide pathway, clean, reliable, affordable energy is edging closer to reality. Consumers, utilities and regulators must continue developing a shared market concept that creates wins for everyone. 
SB 540 ensures that California can continue to benefit from those wins and increase collaboration and efficiencies across the West. History — both the early path to national economic leadership and the recent close calls with our grid — counsel continued work to create the governance necessary to build and run the 100% clean grid that is California’s North Star. 
My research with economists, engineers and policy analysts has shown that clear, equitably enforced market rules are key for achieving California’s energy and climate goals. SB 540 is the next major step on a course toward practical solutions to this challenge.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100422-ROOFTOP-SOLAR-REUTERS-MB-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Mike Tidwell is one of the most aggressive lobbyists in Annapolis, a fierce advocate for climate action who doesn’t suffer fools gladly. Lobbying a state government that routinely resists bold action, where progress is incremental at best, Tidwell has been known to aggravate legislative leaders, administration officials and their top aides with a pull-no-punches style highlighting the urgency of the climate crisis.
But playing against perception, if not against type, Tidwell, the founder and leader of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network (CCAN), has just released a book about global warming that is sweet and lyrical, almost poetic, and surprisingly hopeful.
“The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue” is, in one sense, what it purports to be: A look at how severe weather and climate change have decimated the tree canopy on a single street in Takoma Park, where Tidwell lives. But it’s also a broader meditation on multiple global environmental crises and the people who are heroically trying to do something about them, even at a very micro level.
CCAN has been around for more than two decades now, but probably few people who interact with Tidwell know much about his own journey into climate activism. Once a journalist and travel writer, Tidwell began fretting about the world his son and younger generations would be inheriting and became convinced he needed to do more personally. So CCAN, which has become a regional environmental powerhouse, was born.
Tidwell’s book essentially charts his own activism and observations, particularly in the historically hot year of 2023, alongside the sometimes sudden and other times slow deaths of towering trees on his street and in the surrounding neighborhood in Takoma Park, the “Peoples Republic” that borders Washington, D.C.
  Mike Tidwell is the Director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
One by one, Tidwell introduces the reader to a cast of characters in Maryland who are trying to do something about climate change. Some are familiar political leaders like Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) and Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery). These two elected officials are climate warriors like Tidwell who have also overcome personal crises over the years – in Tidwell’s case, it’s the lingering and debilitating impacts of Lyme disease, which he contracted several years ago thanks to the proliferation of deer in suburban neighborhoods, a trend directly attributable to climate change. Raskin and Charkoudian also happen to be Tidwell’s neighbors in Takoma Park.
In the book, Tidwell also discusses the desire of a climate scientist who wants to bury dead trees to help capture carbon and heal the Earth; the worries of his pastor, vexed by the expense of responding to the intense flooding that is ravaging the church basement; the work of the city arborist and his bosses in Takoma Park; and numerous neighbors who are scrambling to make the best of the disappearing tree canopy on Willow Street by planting climate-resilient trees, expanding their vegetable gardens, and looking after their neighbors’ lawns.
Through the years, Tidwell has become an unofficial steward of tree health in Takoma Park, leading expeditions of volunteers who clip vines that are choking local trees to death – an effort he describes in his book . It’s a model of cataloguing and pruning he hopes other activists will follow across the country. Tidwell writes at length about the science of tree birth, life and death, about the souls of trees and the healing qualities they bring to communities and all sentient beings.
“The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue” is a quick and enjoyable read, and ultimately serves as a primer for climate action that anyone can follow. Tidwell sounds many hopeful notes on what’s possible and attainable, including the growing prominence of renewable energy across the globe.
It’s worth pointing out that he wrote the book before Donald Trump moved back into the White House in January and before Maryland political leaders backslid alarmingly this year on climate legislation; Tidwell no doubt is licking his wounds and shaking his head after a very rough session for environmentalists in Annapolis.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But there are important reminders in “The Lost Trees of Willow Avenue”: Climate catastrophes are in the news every day – epic, apocalyptic, international-scale disasters like wildfires, tsunamis and flooding. Yet the ravages of the crisis are around us all the time – so obvious that we can observe and comprehend the implications of a few dead trees on a single suburban street. It follows, then, that the solutions to this existential crisis are often close at hand – and begin with each and every one of us.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Tidwell book without some polemic. Individual climate action is important, he argues. But don’t lose sight of the responsibilities and culpability of the polluters and their enablers in elected office; collective action is essential.
“We did not, as a country, end racial segregation and stop child labor practices and phase out DDT through voluntary individual choices,” Tidwell observes. “Those victories required national movements of people demanding statutory change. The climate movement, likewise, needs more citizen activists to hasten the switch to clean power and finally abolish fossil fuels by law.”

(CCSD video)A bill to boost the state’s ability to investigate and enforce prevailing wage violations has earned the support of both organized labor and industry groups, but it may still face an uphill battle in the Nevada State Legislature because it would fund new state positions at a time of fiscal uncertainty.
Assembly Bill 502 would restructure the Office of the Labor Commissioner to include a dedicated Public Works Compliance Division to investigate alleged violations of state prevailing wage laws, which set minimum wages for workers on publicly financed projects. The bill also adjusts the penalty structure and allows the office to help public bodies who are having difficulties monitoring compliance.
“We all agree that something needs to change,” Labor Commissioner Brett Harris told lawmakers earlier this month, referring to organized labor groups, the companies that hire them, and the executive branch agency.
The effort to improve the Labor Commissioner office stems from an interim legislative committee. Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter, who represents east Las Vegas, says he was asked to work on proposed legislation.
“I look at this as an industry bill,” he told the Nevada Current. “Not labor or management. It was joint.”
Contractor groups did testify in opposition to AB502 during its hearing in the Assembly Committee on Government Affairs on April 7 but lobbyists emphasized the concerns were relatively minor and could likely be addressed through a minor amendment to the bill.
Lobbyist Warren Hardy, representing the Associated Builders and Contractors of Nevada and Nevada Urban Consortium, called AB502 “the best good faith effort I’ve seen to get at the issues that are of concern.”
The bill was amended and passed out of the committee three days later, and Carter said he believes everyone is satisfied with the end result.
AB502 was referred to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee on Thursday because it comes with a fiscal impact — approximately $790,000 over the biennium, mostly to fund four new staff positions.
Gov. Joe Lombardo included that funding request in his recommended budget.
But many in Carson City expect the state’s revenue forecast to be adjusted downward come May 1 when the Economic Forum meets. If that happens, the state may be forced to “triage,” as Lombardo has put it, state resources and programs, making any request for additional funding much tougher.
Carter told the Current the uncertain revenue outlook feels “like a wet blanket over everything.”
Still, he said he remains “cautiously optimistic” that AB502 can find a path forward.
Labor groups have long said that wage violations are rampant across the state and that better enforcement is needed. In the case of prevailing wage, the public agency awarding the funds is supposed to monitor compliance but many don’t for one reason or another.
“If I go to a big box store and walk out with a set of golf clubs, it will be rapidly investigated, I will be found, prosecuted and punished in a very defined, timely manner,” Nevada State Pipe Trades lobbyist Guy Esposito told lawmakers during the bill hearing. “The people that you represent, wage earners, workers, they probably don’t even know who to call if they haven’t gotten paid properly. If their boss has decided ‘no, you didn’t really work 40 hours last week, you worked 20, and I dare you to say something about it.’”
In Fiscal Year 2024, the Labor Commissioner received 3,828 non-prevailing wage claims and 146 prevailing wage claims, in addition to other types of investigations they oversee. Only 62% of prevailing wage claims were resolved in 90 days, compared to 82% of general wage claims.
The current fiscal year doesn’t end until June 30, but Harris told the committee that as of March 27 her office had received 2,521 wage claims and 185 prevailing wage claims.
“What happens is, our wage and hour claims are so highly voluminous and so regulated that those kind of get priority,” Harris said, adding that public works claims are “more audit heavy” and “a lot denser in technicality” with more complex legal interpretations.
In Nevada, any public project with a contract price of $100,000 or greater that is wholly or partially funded by public dollars is subject to prevailing wage law. Rates for prevailing wage are set annually by the Nevada Office of the Labor Commissioner, which compares similar projects in the region.
Of the 185 wage claims received in the first nine months of the current fiscal year, only 32 were initiated by the public body; 153 were filled by a third party.
Jimmy Schwarz, an organizer with Ironworkers Local 433, said a complaint filed by the union led to members receiving $120,000 in back pay last year.
“Workers were performing iron work and paid as laborers,” he said. “That’s about a $20 an hour difference.”
Harris, who was appointed labor commissioner in 2022, told the Current last year she wanted the office to become more proactive on prevailing wage issues.
The Office of the Labor Commissioner currently has 26 full-time employees. Four of those positions were added last session as part of a 2023 bill that broadened apprenticeship mandates on public works projects.
Republican Assemblymember Rich DeLong asked the labor commissioner if the addition of four new positions this session would be enough considering their current and expected workload.
“The honest answer to that is probably not,” responded Harris. “Ideally, I think we’d want eight, but I also know we have to start somewhere.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-21-25-at-7.25-PM-1024x572.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As the Trump administration spearheads federal rules revisions on water, considering the removal of Clean Water Act protections, Utah environmental advocates worry it could impact 79% of the water in the Great Salt Lake Basin. 
The Environmental Protection Agency announced in March that it would review the definition of “waters of the United States” to streamline and speed up permitting and cut compliance costs, according to a news release. Also, to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court decision on what constitutes federally protected water. 
That decision limited the scope of federally protected wetlands, ruling that water bodies would only be considered in the conservation provisions if they are “relatively permanent” waterways that are also adjacent to interstate navigable waters, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers defines as “waters which are currently used, or were used in the past, or may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce.” 
However, the proposed rule is expected to go further.

“If finalized as proposed, the EPA’s rule would exclude most of Utah’s seasonal streams and wetlands — waters that make up the bulk of the state’s freshwater ecosystems,” according to a news release by the Utah Wildlife Federation, a wildlife protection organization.
According to a Federal Register notice looking for public input on the proposed rule, “going forward, the (EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers) will seek to provide clear and transparent direction regarding the definition and will prioritize practical implementation approaches, provide for durability and stability, as well as for more effective and efficient jurisdictional determinations, permitting actions, and other actions consistent with relevant decisions of the Supreme Court.”
Any future action on the definition of “waters of the United States” will consider feedback from landowners, industry groups, the agricultural community, states, Tribes, local governments, community organizations, environmental groups, and the general public, according to the notice.



Let us know what you think...


 


That narrower definition increases Utah environmentalists’ worries about the future of the already declining Great Salt Lake, since more than 79% of the water in the basin comes from rain-fed, seasonal streams, the release reads, citing a University of Massachusetts and Yale University study. In Utah, according to the Utah Department of Natural resources, 90% to 95% of water supply comes from seasonal snowfall which feeds the streams and rivers that fill reservoirs and natural lakes. 
“Utah has invested millions in restoring watersheds to improve water quality and help more water reach the Great Salt Lake and drinking water reservoirs,” Isobel Lingenfelter, wildlife connectivity coordinator at the Utah Wildlife Federation, said in a statement. “It’s baffling that, at a time when drought and dust storms threaten our health and economy, the EPA is considering a rule that would make it easier to pollute or destroy the very waters we depend on.”
Cox considers emergency declaration as drought worsens in southern Utah and Lake Powell levels drop

But for Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, the policy would make rules clear and consistent across all states.
“The previous Administration’s definition of ‘waters of the United States’ placed unfair burdens on the American people and drove up the cost of doing business,” Zeldin said in a release. “Our goal is to protect America’s water resources consistent with the law of the land while empowering American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families to help Power the Great American Comeback.” 
According to the EPA, the Biden administration failed to follow the Supreme Court ruling, maintaining uncertainty on what bodies fall under Clean Water Act protections. It’s now a priority for this administration to work with state and local officials “to protect their treasured water bodies while accelerating economic opportunity,” the EPA wrote in the release. 
However, with vulnerable streams feeding drinking water reservoirs in Utah, the advocates warn that such policy changes will bring another burden to the state’s government.
“The Supreme Court tied EPA’s hands, but not completely,” Lingenfelter said. “The agency still has the authority — and the responsibility — to protect drinking water sources where it can. With Lake Powell less than a third full and the Great Salt Lake disappearing before our eyes, the state will need to step up if the federal government steps back.”

Kennedy has promoted numerous controversial and unfounded views around public health issues. Kennedy most recently claimed measles could be treated with Vitamin A and is linked to poor diet. Kennedy also petitioned the F.D.A. in 2021 to stop the COVID-19 vaccine rollout because he believed the risks outweighed the benefits, and pointed to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as alternative treatments after it was deemed ineffective against the virus. 
Kennedy has also claimed environmental chemicals could affect a child’s sexual orientation or cause “gender confusion;” baselessly connected anti-depressant use to school shootings and has advocated for raw milk consumption despite health risks.

Butler said the timing makes passing his bill challenging this year, the bill’s main purpose currently is “to just have the conversation,” while Ingram said he hopes to pass his bill this year.
HB 580, sponsored by Butler, proposes banning schools participating in federally funded meal programs from serving or selling “ultra-processed food” starting in the 2026-2027 school year. It lists 11 ingredients that would qualify food as ultra-processed, including potassium bromate, titanium dioxide, brominated vegetable oil, Red Dye 40, Yellow Dye 5 and Blue Dye 1. The legislation also directs the Alabama State Department of Education to create a certification process and publicly list compliant schools. The law would not affect private purchases of these foods.
HB 491, sponsored by Ingram, specifically targets seven synthetic food dyes: Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, and Green No. 3. It would prohibit any public K-12 school from selling or serving food containing these dyes, effective Aug. 1, 2025. The bill provides an exception for sales during school fundraisers held off-campus or well after school hours.
California banned Red Dye No. 3 in 2023 after a 2021 report from the California Environmental Protection Agency indicated that federal levels for safe synthetic food dye consumption may not be adequate for children, linking it to concerns over increased Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnoses in youth over the last 20 years.
The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in January that it was banning Red Dye No. 3 in food effective in early 2027, and in drugs effective 2028. The health impact of other dyes is still being researched.
Apreill Hartsfield, a policy and data analyst for VOICES for Alabama’s Children, said in an interview Monday that while there is some research that supports claims that some additives can cause adverse health effects, she said more research is needed before implementing policy.
“We have to be careful that we are really making sure that this is backed up by science and not just going off conjecture or anecdotal evidence,” Hartsfield said.
Ingram suggested that “Make America Healthy Again” efforts in Washington have made the conversation possible in Alabama, saying that Kennedy, who was once a Democrat, is what “we need in this country to get down to the truth, instead of following a party telling us we don’t need to do that.”
HB 491 was referred to the House Health Committee, while HB 580 went to the House Education Policy Committee. Both await further action.

(Legislative stream screengrab)In the last few legislative sessions, Nevada has seen reforms to the criminal legal system to ensure certain crimes, such as low-level drug offenses, don’t lead to lengthy sentences. 
State lawmakers should also consider a process to review the sentences of those who have already been incarcerated for a prolonged period of time, says Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth.
Assembly Bill 91, deemed “second look” legislation, would create an avenue for those incarcerated to have sentences reviewed by the State Board of Parole Commissioners after they’ve served extended periods of time. 
“We as a body and legislators have realized that placing somebody in prison for extreme amounts of time does not necessarily meet the public policy goals, especially when they have been rehabilitated,” Roth, a Reno Democrat, said during hearing on the bill earlier this month.
AB 91 passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee April 11 in a party line vote but hasn’t been heard in the Assembly. 
It has until Tuesday to receive a vote in the Assembly. Except for bills declared exempt, legislation must be passed in its house of origin by then to move forward. 
Lawmakers in previous years have sought to address the growing prison population by revising sentencing guidelines and bolstering diversion programs. A 2019 bill that passed with bipartisan support reduced penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes while increasing access to speciality court programs.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has tried to roll back those provisions, but with only limited success.  He’s proposing more punitive measures this session that include increasing penalties for drug dealers and curtailing early discharge from probation for gun violations.
Lombardo’s efforts to pass tougher actions come as the Nevada Department of Corrections faces a $50 million budget shortfall during a session in which lawmakers are growing more and more apprehensive about the prospects of reduced revenue as a result of a slowing economy. The bill is also likely to face challenges from a Legislature controlled by many of the same Democrats who passed the criminal justice reforms Lombardo has targeted.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers in the interim session voted to pursue a “second look” authorizing sentencing review boards to re-evaluate some sentences.
The legislation’s proponents note it not only addresses the far-reading societal harms inflicted by mass incarceration, it is also a way to reduce the prison population, which could alleviate financial strains. 
There have been 13 states along with the District of Columbia that have passed similar “second look” review policies, according to the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. 
The Nevada legislation also allows the parole board to “grant a second look review” for people convicted of Category A offenses, which include murder and sexual assault, provided the incarcerated person has served 25 years. For category B felonies, such as robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, they must have served at least 15 years.
Lawmakers were told during interim legislative hearings last year that of the slightly less than 11,000 people incarcerated by the Nevada Department of Corrections, 1,888 were sentenced to more than 15 years, and of those, 1,272 people currently incarcerated have already served 15 years. 
Those serving life sentences, sentenced to death or deemed as “a significant and articulable risk to public safety” wouldn’t be eligible for consideration. 
The bill also expands opportunities for parole for people convicted of crimes before turning 25, opportunities currently only extended to those who committed crimes before 18.
“Research shows individuals tend to age out of high crime years as they mature, making extended incarceration less effective in reducing recidivism,” Roth said. “Second look policies also recognize the developmental difference between youth and adults, aligning again with national reforms that provide greater opportunities for youth offenders.”
Opposition from DAs, law enforcement
Republican Assemblyman Ken Gray, of Dayton, questioned why the state needed to provide additional ways for inmates to attempt to reduce their sentences.  
“There’s a lot of different avenues you can go through with your attorney,” he said. “It just seems like we’re just adding more and more ways to challenge what, at the time, is a fair sentence.”
While there are ways for people to challenge the constitutionality of the case or any issue associated with the trial, there aren’t many ways for people to challenge or review the sentence itself, Roth said. 
The bill was supported by public defenders throughout the state. 
“Twenty five years, 15 years, is a long time,” said Angela Knott, a public defender with Washoe County. “AB 91 reflects the belief that people shouldn’t be defined by their worst actions. It gives those who have truly changed, who have grown up and matured, a chance to prove their potential for a positive contribution to society.”
The prison rights advocacy group Return Strong and the Nevada Coalition Against the Death Penalty, though not opposing the bill, said it falls short. 
“Building mechanisms for people to have an opportunity and hope for freedom is a huge motivator for change,” said Nicole Williams, a board member with Return Strong. But the bill, she said, doesn’t go far enough since it excludes people serving life without parole sentences.
“This exclusion fails to account for individuals who were sentenced under outdated policies, extreme sentencing practices, who were targeted by racist law, or those who have demonstrated remarkable rehabilitation while incarcerated,” Williams said. 
District Attorneys and law enforcement agencies opposed the bill. 
Jennifer Noble, a lobbyist with Nevada District Attorneys Association, specifically cited provisions allowing a second look for those convicted of sexual assault and murder. 
She agreed it’s not a “foregone conclusion” that those convicted of such crimes would win release, the process itself could come at the expense of victims. 
“To ensure victims will be heard as required by the constitution … they have to be notified, they have to decide whether to participate, they have to relieve these events and they have to be retraumatized,” Noble said. “Lawful sentences should not be second guessed every two years each time an offender can file a new petition under this bill.”
Roth said there is nothing in the bill that prevents the parole board from considering the person’s crime and the impact of victims. It simply asks the review board to consider  “how old they were, how much they’ve changed, what they’ve accomplished”, she said. 
“At the end of the day, this is not a get out of jail free card,” Roth said. “This is an opportunity for the board, who already makes these reviews on a daily basis, to consider a human being and who they are holistically.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Image-4-21-25-at-3.56-PM-1024x635.jpeg,,,2025-04-22 09:10:12.694907

PR on behalf of the Alaska Pollock Fishery Alliance)Alaska U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and other coastal senators have proposed new legislation to exempt seafood processing companies from a cap on the number of international workers they can hire through the temporary H-2B visa program.
The Alaska seafood industry regularly recruits and hires workers from around the world each year, including Mexico, the Philippines and Ukraine. Companies must demonstrate they are unable to fill processing jobs with American workers, and then through the temporary H-2B visa program, they hire thousands of guest workers to meet the needs of Alaska’s labor-intensive, high-volume commercial fishing seasons.
Seafood processing companies must apply each year for a number of H-2B visas in order to hire workers, competing with various nonagricultural sectors, including construction, landscaping and hospitality industries. Currently, Congress has set the cap at 66,000 visas per year, split evenly between the time periods of October through March and April through September. 
Under the proposed legislation, the Save Our Seafood Act, seafood companies would be exempt from caps on these visas, to allow hiring of international workers as needed.
“Alaska’s seafood industry is a delicate chain — and when processors don’t have the workforce to meet demand, the whole industry can fall apart,” Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a written statement announcing the legislation. 
“Coastal communities, family-owned fishing boats, and Alaskans who work in the industry need to know that they have fully-functioning operations where they can deliver their catch,” she said. “Through this legislation, I’m working to ensure that the industry has a dependable workforce that can process and deliver the highest-quality seafood in the world.” 
Murkowski introduced similar legislation in 2023, but it failed to advance in Congress. Several U.S. senators from Virginia, Maryland and Louisiana signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation to support their fishing industries, including crab and shrimp fleets. 
No other industry in Alaska relies as heavily on out-of-state workers as seafood processing, which increased to over 80% nonresident workers in 2023, according to an analysis by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The number of Alaska seafood processor jobs has also declined over the last decade, and totaled 8,495 in 2023, the most recently available number. 
Alaska’s seafood industry has also taken a hit in recent years, with a “perfect storm” of declining fish prices, global market competition, and rising costs to bring products to market. 
But despite Alaska’s seafood market woes, the labor needs of the processing industry remain the same, said Brian Gannon, vice president of government relations at LaborMex, a Texas-based company that connects employers with international workers through the H2 visa program. 
“You still need a lot of people to touch individual fish to feed the machines,” he said. 
Seafood processing workers handle fish unloaded from commercial fishing vessels, from sorting, cleaning and cutting, to freezing, canning and packaging. Though processing plants have become more efficient, Gannon noted Alaska seafood processing has always relied on out-of-state labor. 
“It’s consistent with the last 100 years, that hasn’t changed,” he said. “Because in the remote coastal communities there is no workforce that is available, that is ready and not already engaged in the fishing or tendering effort. There’s just a severe lack of human capital in those regions.”
In 2023, Alaska employers applied for 825 guest workers via the H-2B visa program, according to the Alaska Department of Labor, and 554 were for seafood processor roles. Visas are valid for up to three years, and there were an estimated 1,500 international workers each year, Gannon has said. 
Gannon estimates the workforce needed for Alaska is more like 4,000 jobs for the peak summer fishing seasons. “The industry needs to fight for a place within the 66,000 annual visas,” he said. “And the seafood industry needs to compete with landscapers, hotel operations, amusement parks, horse racing stables, grass cutters, lawn mowers, to provide workers or to have access to workers to cut fish.”
Gannon said the proposed legislation to exempt the seafood industry from the visa cap would benefit businesses. “Those employers would not have to worry about, ‘Are we going to have access to visas this year or not?’” he said. “It would be obviously very helpful for the Alaska seafood industry, and the U.S. seafood industry.”
Each year, seafood companies host job fairs abroad, and contract companies such as Gannon’s to assist with recruiting and hiring. Workers go through a hiring process, background check and visa interview, then if they are approved, seafood companies arrange their travel and airfare to work in Alaska’s over 70 onshore plants and 15 at-sea catcher-processor vessels. 
Gannon argued the cap does not reflect the current need for guest workers in nonagricultural industries nationwide. “There’s only so many visas allowed by the federal government for workers to come in, and that’s an arbitrary number that was set 20 or 25 years ago. It’s only in the last six years that that cap has been hit, where the employers are requesting more visas than than are available, and now it’s up to a factor of three or four times,” he said. “I believe most likely that that number should be 200,000 or 300,000 visas to reflect the needs of industry.”
The Trump administration’s escalating crackdown on immigrants and ramped up deportations could present a dilemma for U.S. industries that rely on immigrant labor.
Ganon said while there is worry and concern, there is a precedent for the Trump administration prioritizing food industries. “When COVID hit, the administration quickly allowed for workers from Mexico and other countries that were in jobs and having nexus to food security, and U.S. food production, and they came in,” he said. “So we believe that the literal actions surrounding visas and critical food jobs, or food producing jobs, will remain an actual priority of this administration, regardless of words that come out of Washington, D.C.” 
Gannon noted that interest is still high among international workers, as wages are $16.50 per hour for processing jobs this year, with airfare, housing and meals included and promised overtime.
If the bill is passed in Congress, it would be enacted for next year’s fishing season, in 2026. In the meantime, Gannon says industry advocates hope to garner support for the guest worker program, and the seafood industry. “There’s so many challenges, and but for a few administrative strokes by the federal government, they could do their part to really help employers in Alaska, and this would be a big thing to safeguard the industry,” he said.

Federal officials project greater drops throughout this year. Echo Bay Marina, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, summer 2024. (Photo courtesy Kyle Roerink)While Lake Mead sits at about one-third full, a bipartisan cohort of Nevada’s state lawmakers think now is the time to sell off public lands to support more Colorado-River-dependent homes and businesses in Southern Nevada. 
On Thursday, Nevada Assemblymembers, the majority of whom are Democrats, overwhelmingly voted to ask President Donald Trump to support selling off tens of thousands of acres outside of Las Vegas as fast as possible. The resolution implores the administration to support  federal legislation from Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act. 
The news of the 36-6* vote in the Assembly comes as communities across the West are rising up and opposing efforts to sell off public lands. Coalitions of concerned citizens across party lines have reservations about these efforts to build in areas prone to drought, wildfire, or flooding.
Nevada Democrats do not. 
Traditionally, public lands privatization is an issue championed by sage brush rebels and urbane developers aligned with the GOP. The Keep It Public movement in Nevada has some legitimate supporters but a dark underbelly. Thanks to a special carveout in federal law championed by Nevada Democrats in the late 1990s, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)  sells off large chunks of public land that facilitates cookie-cutter growth around Las Vegas and praise from politicians. 
Across the West, the private-sector crowd views many places not named Yosemite or Yellowstone, or lacking a Grand or Great adjective, as blank canvases for industry. The industry du jour changes among the decisionmakers. But the lands are always expendable enough. Today, affordable housing is the artifice by which powerful interests believe they can get cheap land for major projects.  
For Las Vegas, there’s less water in the Colorado River System and rapidly warming temperatures posing deep uncertainty. As for the overall quality of life, it depends on your income bracket. And most of the people championing public land sales don’t fret around tax time.   Many politicians are, after all, wealthy. 
For the masses, there are more regressive taxes and higher utility bills across Nevada than decades past. Nevada’s public education system still ranks as one of the worst in the nation. The health care system is near the bottom rung. The  well being of children is worse in Nevada compared to other states. And, of course, housing affordability is a major problem as investors like Black Rock buy up residential blocks that were, you guessed it, built on lands sold off by the BLM. 
 A quarter century of practice can fairly raise the question: Is the public-lands-sale model working? Now is the time for Nevada to tell the others in the West: proceed with caution. Instead, Nevada politicians of all stripes are saying “build, baby, build.” 
The challenge, of course, is finding an effective substitute that meaningfully incentivizes the private sector without further sapping the public in the long run.  In Clark County, there are more than 75,000 acres of infill available. But developers aren’t buying it at meaningful rates to appease political appetites. 
We have opportunity zones, abatements, investment trusts, deductions, and credits that industries benefit from in the West.  Data centers, energy companies, mines, and casinos are a few industries that can attest to the benefits.
Meaningful solutions to the housing problem will require financial tools and reasonable foresight too. And that will require more than milking the sacred cow of legitimized public land sales. We need to put people where there’s existing infrastructure, high-rise opportunities, walkability, and mass-transportation options. There must be water and power infrastructure already in-place. 
But instead, Nevada Democrats just supported putting more folks in the wildland-urban interface so associated with the fringes and foothills of western public lands. These are water-scarce places currently home to desert tortoise and important carbon capturing environments. Many of the very people who attest to giving a damn about urban heat just voted to exacerbate the problem. But don’t try telling them that. There’s money to be made. 
The type of sprawl Nevada Democrats voted to support via AJR10 will warrant expensive new water lines, sewer systems, roads, electricity infrastructure, schools, fire stations, and a host of other intangibles that have costs that span decades. These are not one-time expenses. They are forever expenses. 
Nevada Democrats and Senator Cortez Masto are desperate to expand the existing policy from former Senators Reid and Bryan known because it dispenses proceeds from public land sales. And other states will take notice. Such revenue streams are red meat for states looking to Nevada as an exemplar. 
BLM accounts for  $4 billion in revenue generated from public land sales since the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act first took effect. Public education, regional water managers, and the aviation department split less than $700 million since the genesis of the program, according to a federal report released last summer. 
New proposals would have to indeed fill the gaps. But it does make you wonder: Are public land sales the only way to support our community?  Is it sustainable? Are the funds sufficient to cover the new needs that will inevitably occur. 
Nevada Democrats think so. 
But these are folks who also think that, of all things to ask President Trump to do, selling off public lands is the most pressing issue of the day.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee Wednesday approved a bill that gives law enforcement the power to demand that people remove their medical face masks in public so that they can be identified.
HB 559, sponsored by Rep. Jamie Kiel, R-Russellville, allows people to wear a health care mask while in public without being charged with loitering, but allows law enforcement to demand that people show them a note from their medical provider to not spread an infection during a protest. It also allows law enforcement to demand that people remove their masks so that they can be identified.
“If there is not a reason to wear the mask in a public place, this also deals with universities, then there needs to be an excuse for wearing that mask,” Kiel said to members of the committee. “Instead of just wearing a mask in a place where there may be, like a parade for instance, it is not a masquerade mask, then this would allow law enforcement to request to remove the mask unless they have a medical reason.”

According to the bill, Alabama statute states that people can be charged with loitering if they remain in a public place to panhandle, gamble and to solicit prostitution, and if they remain in a transportation facility for commercial purposes.
They can also be charged with loitering if they wear a mask while in a public space or stay on the grounds of the university or college after they are told to leave by officials with the school and who are not connected with the university in some way.
People can be charged with a violation if they are charged with loitering for the first time, but they may be charged with a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.
The legislation Kiel filed exempts people from getting charged with loitering during times they are wearing a mask while in public, such as a protest or a parade, but they must demonstrate to law enforcement that they have legitimate medical reason.
“If I want to wear my mask for safety procedures, I have to get a doctor’s order just for me to stand out (there), or just for the three of us gathering together,” said Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery.
Republicans on the committee allows law enforcement to identify people who stay in a public place, such as a protest on school grounds for example, in case any incidents occur, and that university and college officials agree with the measure.
“The only thing we are trying to do is when we are having a situation on campuses where we have some folks who are coming to protest,” said Porter Bannister, vice chancellor for state affairs with the University of Alabama system. “They may or may not be students. They are telling our police officers, ‘No, I will not take off my mask’ when we ask them for identification. That is all we are trying to do.”

The legislation is in response to a lawsuit that alleges that the Alabama Department of Corrections and the University of Alabama at Birmingham had an agreement that gave the university permission to retain the organs of those who died in prison. Families of the deceased said they were not informed of the arrangement or that their loved ones’ body parts were taken without their permission..
State code already prohibits medical examiners from retaining organs unless specifically allowed by the Governor’s Office, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office or the district attorney in the case, but the law did not outline any sanctions.
“Basically, the warden was giving UAB permission to keep those organs in violation of a very clear prohibition,” England said to the committee during the meeting.

(Photo by Antonio Cotrim – Pool/Getty Images)After weeks at death’s door and just hours before his demise, Pope Francis on Easter Sunday met with Vice President J.D. Vance of Ohio. Vance hadn’t been scheduled for an official visit with the pontiff, and the meeting called attention to an issue that has divided Catholics and prominent Republicans in Ohio since last summer — immigration.
Francis, 88, died of a stroke early Monday. Last month, he was discharged from the hospital after a severe health crisis that included pneumonia.
He had clashed for years with President Donald Trump over Trump’s treatment of immigrants. In 2016, just after saying mass on the Mexican side of its border with the United States, Francis said that anyone who advocates building walls is “not Christian.” The Vatican later denied that the remark was directed at Trump, but the president has steadfastly advocated for a wall as he repeats false claims about migrants.
While Trump has pushed for a wall, Francis fought just as hard on behalf of migrants from the time he became pope in 2013. During that time, anti-immigrant rhetoric around the world has grown, while the number of forcibly displaced people has more than doubled, to 120 million, USA Today reported Monday.
In a 2015 speech to Congress, the pope implored lawmakers to help those crossing the southern border fleeing persecution and seeking opportunity.
“Is this not what we want for our own children?” Francis asked. “We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”
He reiterated those sentiments in Sunday’s Easter message.
“I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!’” it said.
Those words stand in stark contrast to the words and actions of Trump and his administration. He has referred to immigrants as “not human” and “animals” who are “poisoning the blood” of the United States. Trump and his allies have referred to undocumented crossings as an “invasion” even after the rhetoric helped spur a racist mass murder in El Paso in 2019.
Trump now is deporting or trying to deport hundreds of thousands who came legally using the CBP One app, unknown numbers of foreign university students.  He’s also dusted off a law not used since World War II to accuse undocumented migrants of gang affiliations and deport them to a notorious Salvadorean prison. The president has ignored court orders related to the latter deportations, and appears headed for a showdown with the U.S. Supreme Court in the matter.
Trump is also trying to end temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including many Haitians in Springfield.
As the Caribbean nation has descended into chaos, those in the United States are terrified of being forced to return. But during a debate last summer, Trump repeated the racist lie that Haitians in Springfield were stealing their neighbors pets.
“In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” he said. “The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They’re eating — they are eating the pets of the people that live there.”
In the ensuing furor, dozens of bomb threats were made against public buildings, including elementary schools.
As a U.S. Senator representing Ohio, those threats jeopardized Vance’s constituents. But he repeated the lies even after his staff knew they were untrue.
The episode divided some Ohio Republicans who also happened to be Catholic.
Vance became one in 2019. Gov. Mike DeWine is a lifelong Catholic who has stayed all executions since taking office and signed a harsh anti-abortion bill into law.
During last year’s firestorm in Springfield, the governor criticized Trump and Vance in the New York Times.
“I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield,” DeWine wrote. “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.”
Less than two months later, Trump and Vance won the election. Then in January, the president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council met with Pope Francis at the Vatican and then said Trump’s planned deportations and aid cuts would be calamitous for his country.
In February, Francis wrote a letter to U.S. bishops saying that Trump would create a “major crisis” with the mass deportations he planned. The pope also slammed the interpretation of Catholic theology Vance used to justify them.
Vance had invoked the doctrine “ordo amoris” to claim that one should think of family, then community, then country ahead of the rest of the world.
The pope said that was wrong. He noted that Jesus himself was forced to seek refuge in a foreign land.
“Jesus Christ… did not live apart from the difficult experience of being expelled from his own land because of an imminent risk to his life, and from the experience of having to take refuge in a society and a culture foreign to his own,” Francis said in his letter.
He added that people should consider all as being part of their families and communities.
“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan‘ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception,” the pope said.
He then sank into a 38-day hospitalization. Then he rallied, defied doctors’ orders and spent a busy Easter Sunday, the most important day on the Christian calendar. And he made room for a brief meeting with Vance as one of his last acts.
Coming a day after the pope’s lieutenants said they talked to Vance about “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,” the meeting seemed intended to send a message. “Pope Francis Gave JD Vance a serious lesson just hours before he died,” was the title of a column Hafiz Rashid wrote in The New Republic.
Vance honored the pontiff after his passing in a post on X. But he made no mention of migrants.
“I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he said. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill. But I’ll always remember him for the… homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul.”
For his part, DeWine acknowledged the pope’s relentless advocacy for migrants.
“He was an inspiration to us and to millions around the world,” DeWine said in a written statement. “His genuine love of and devotion to all people — the poor, the unborn, those without a home, those emigrating to build a better life for themselves and their families, those of all faiths, and those with no faith — was evidenced to the world from the day he was selected to serve as Pope until his last public appearance on Easter Sunday.”

This is a humanitarian crisis and requires immediate action by the governor.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Frank Knaack: How to address Vermont’s housing and homelessness crises.","This commentary is by Frank Knaack, executive director of the Housing and Homelessness Alliance of Vermont.Over 3,400. That’s the estimated number of unhoused Vermonters on any given night, including over 730 children. And, we know this number is an undercount, as it reflects only the people who engaged with our state’s dedicated and perpetually under-resourced shelter service providers. To give some perspective on how large of a problem this is, Vermont’s statewide shelter capacity is just 655 households, and they are all full. There is literally no safe place for potentially thousands of Vermonters to go. Vermont is in the middle of a housing and homelessness crisis. This crisis did not come about by accident. It is the result of choices made by generations of local, state and federal political leaders. Fortunately, our state political leaders also have multiple opportunities to help fix it. Here’s what the Legislature can do. First, Vermont must expand the production of affordable housing. According to the 2024 Vermont Housing Needs Assessment, by 2029 Vermont needs 3,295 homes to address homelessness and 3,957 homes to normalize vacancy rates. We urge the Legislature to invest $25 million in funding for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, which will allow VHCB to continue the pipeline of desperately needed affordable housing. This is in addition to VHCB’s full statutory share of the property transfer tax.Second, Vermont must invest in homelessness prevention programs and services. We urge the legislature to support the House Human Services Committee’s recommendation of an additional $3.75 million to fund 33 critical case management positions that are set to go away in June when federal ERAP money expires. Without these vital positions, we will see more of our neighbors become unhoused. This is in addition to the Housing Opportunity Grant Program funds that are already in the budget. Third, Vermont must ensure emergency shelter for Vermonters in need. We urge the Legislature to provide $44.6 million to ensure that unhoused Vermonters defined as vulnerable by the state, including seniors, families with children, those with disabilities, and people who are pregnant, can maintain shelter through the General Assistance Emergency Housing Program. To be clear, without these funds our state’s solution will be sending children and vulnerable adults into the streets and woods to live. Here’s what the governor can do.In addition to supporting and signing a budget with the funding outlined above, the governor must take immediate action to reduce the harms he created when he vetoed the budget adjustment bill.This bill would have kept seniors, families with children, those with disabilities, people who are pregnant, and other vulnerable unhoused Vermonters sheltered through the end of June. Because of the governor’s veto, hundreds of these vulnerable Vermonters have already lost their shelter. The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. Vermont has no plan to shelter these vulnerable Vermonters. As our state’s shelter and service system was already beyond capacity before this latest crisis, our state’s shelter providers are again at the point of giving tents to families with young children and triaging cases to focus on keeping people literally alive. This is a humanitarian crisis and requires immediate action by the governor. While we appreciate Gov. Scott’s recent executive order, which allowed a narrowly defined group of vulnerable unhoused Vermonters to stay sheltered, it still leaves hundreds of our most vulnerable unhoused neighbors out on the street, including seniors, people with disabilities and people fleeing domestic violence. We urge the governor to take immediate action to ensure continued access to emergency shelter through the General Assistance Emergency Housing Program for all vulnerable unhoused Vermonters not included in his executive order. While Vermont’s housing and homelessness crisis is the result of multiple factors, the core driver of this crisis is the severe shortage of homes affordable to people with the lowest incomes and a widening gap between incomes and housing costs. By expanding access to affordable housing, these recommendations will move Vermont closer to solving one of the major crises facing our state while also helping keep more Vermonters at risk of homelessness from losing their home and continuing to protect our most vulnerable unhoused neighbors. In addition to helping Vermont solve its housing and homelessness crisis, more affordable housing will also allow Vermont to reduce the need for and costs related to our homelessness response system, which is currently in very high demand.This should be an easy choice. Vermont’s housing and homelessness crisis was not created overnight and will not be solved overnight, but these recommendations will show that our state political leaders are serious about a solution. We urge our state leaders to adopt them.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Frank Knaack: How to address Vermont’s housing and homelessness crises.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

It is my hope that all Vermont schools are required to be prepared for a cardiac emergency, so that no family suffers the way mine has.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kristy Bohannon: A life lost from cardiac arrest.","This commentary is by Kristy Bohannon of Alburgh. She has worked in health care for the past six years.My 14-year-old daughter lost her life to a cardiac arrest at school, and I’m calling on the Vermont Legislature to ensure no other family suffers that loss. Imagine getting a call from your child’s school that your child is unresponsive. As a parent, phone calls from school usually mean that your kids are getting into trouble or they’re in the nurse’s office with a minor scrape or headache.Every day feels like it happened just yesterday, but it was April 14, 2022, just after lunch, that I received a life-changing phone call from my daughter’s elementary school. “Something has happened to Adrianna, she was in gym class, just jogging laps for a few minutes and collapsed, she is currently unresponsive and isn’t breathing,” they said.While some efforts were made at the school to revive her, I remember them telling me that first responders had arrived and were trying to start her heart with CPR, but they couldn’t put her into the ambulance for transport until she was breathing on her own.The time between hanging up the phone to Adrianna arriving at the hospital where I was employed was the longest moment of my life. The hardest medical consent a parent shall ever have to give is to tell someone they can stop CPR on her 14-year-old daughter after hours of trying to save her. That day will forever be the worst day of our lives not only for all of her family, including her younger brother Caiden, but for everyone in the community who knew her. Ultimately, my beautiful daughter, Adrianna Lee Bohannon, lost her life tragically to cardiac arrest on April 14, 2022.I strongly believe Adrianna’s outcome could have been different if all schools had a cardiac emergency response plan. CPR, if performed immediately, can double or triple a person’s chance of survival. I am not sure if CPR was immediate or when the AED was used, but everyone’s effort was at best to keep her alive. I was later informed that only a couple staff members were trained on how to use the AED.My daughter was one of the 23,000 children who experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year, and she was one of the 90% who did not survive.The American Heart Association is pushing for legislation requiring all Vermont schools develop a cardiac emergency response plan that is practiced — just like fire drills — to ensure students, faculty and staff are prepared to act in the event of a cardiac emergency. I am joining the American Heart Association in support of bill H.247, which will require all Vermont schools to have these lifesaving plans.A cardiac emergency response plan can increase survival rates from cardiac arrest by 50% or more by enabling a trained lay responder team to take action. About 40% of cardiac arrests in children are sports-related. Whether in the classroom or on the playing field, having a plan in place to enable faculty, staff and students to quickly and correctly respond to a cardiac emergency can save lives.Join me in contacting our state legislators to let them know bill H.247 is a top priority for our families and the entire Vermont community, and to make sure our schools can implement these proven lifesaving plans. It is my hope that all Vermont schools are required to be prepared for a cardiac emergency, so that no family suffers the way mine has.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kristy Bohannon: A life lost from cardiac arrest.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

For the next 10 weeks, people can travel to and from the scenic San Juan Islands for free as the archipelago tests the waters of county-run, passenger-only ferry service. State money is paying for a twice-daily roundtrip between the three most populous islands and Anacortes using a chartered whale watching tour boat.
The boat trial grew out of frustration with unreliable state ferry service in recent years. But even if the county’s walk-on ferry proves popular, it’s unclear how it could be sustained.
“Until people in San Juan County feel that they can count on the [state] ferries like they did 10 years ago,” San Juan County Council Chair Kari McVeigh said, “this is a big deal.”
McVeigh rode along on the inaugural round trip between Friday Harbor and downtown Anacortes. The foot ferry made intermediate stops at Orcas Landing and Lopez Island in each direction. McVeigh noted the boat was very punctual, as hoped for.
Ridership was light during the opening weekend of service due to the short-notice startup and limited pre-launch publicity. Captain Brian Goodremont steered the 55-foot tour boat Sea Lion across sun-splashed seas at about the same speed as the state ferries – 17 knots – on an unusually warm Good Friday to inaugurate the service.

“I think it is mostly going to be islanders that use this service,” said Goodremont, who owns San Juan Safaris, the contracted passenger-only ferry operator. “As we get closer to peak season for visitors – once school is out – I can see visitors using it as an alternative.”
As part of the same state-funded pilot project, San Juan County also contracted with a different local tour company for emergency interisland water taxi service, which will sail only when the state interisland ferry is expected to be out of service for more than four hours. That standby water taxi contract similarly expires on June 30.
In recent weeks, state ferry system leaders have told the public and their overseers in the state Legislature that the car ferries have turned the corner on reliability. Washington State Ferries chief Steve Nevey and his deputy told a state Senate panel last month that crewing is back to pre-pandemic levels and cancellations significantly reduced.
“We’re clearly going in the right direction,” deputy John Vezina testified. “We’re clearing the maintenance backlog. We are on the path to building new boats. But it’s been tough for our customers and we are aware of that.”
Riding the temporary passenger-only service
The San Juans to Anacortes passenger-only ferry pilot project was designed with the needs of ferry-dependent islanders at the top of mind, but the service should be appealing to visitors from the mainland too. The foot ferry terminates in downtown Anacortes at the Cap Sante Marina where islanders can walk to a wide variety of businesses, restaurants and medical/dental clinics. Daytrippers headed to the San Juans can park at the marina for free, unlike at the state ferry Anacortes terminal.
The Sea Lion vessel is certified for 49 passengers, but Goodremont said it will be limited to 35 riders for the time being so that everyone has access to the heated, indoor seating if desired.
Orcas Island resident Sooz Stahl was pleased to hear about the new county-run ferry as she waited in the sun for the state ferry to take her to her job running the post office on neighboring Shaw Island.
“I think it’s fantastic,” Stahl said. “They should support ways and plans for people to get here and to visit the islands without a car.”
Stahl said she was unsure whether she would use the walk-on ferry during its 10-week tryout. The county-provided service skips Shaw Island because the isle lacks a public dock suitable for the passenger-only ferry.
A potential drawback of the foot ferry for visitors is that there is no public transit or Uber/Lyft on the islands. Friday Harbor is quite walkable, but Orcas Landing and the Lopez dropoff at Odlin County Park are a good distance from the main attractions of their respective islands.
Traditional taxis are available on San Juan and Orcas islands, though. Bikes can be brought on board the passenger boat with prior reservation.
For travelers going between Friday Harbor and the mainland, the walk-on ferry takes longer than Washington State Ferries because of the intermediate stops.
In years past, Bellingham was proposed as the mainland terminus for a San Juan Islands passenger-only ferry run. But San Juan County officials only considered Anacortes as the mainland landing this time around because the point of the state funding was to backstop the state ferry service.
The temporary passenger-only ferry is fare-free because the state is footing the bill. Former Gov. Jay Inslee awarded the county $1.5 million in discretionary emergency relief funds last September after hearing a litany of complaints from islanders about missed appointments, stranded schoolchildren and other disruptions caused by cancelled state ferry sailings.
Just recently, the state Department of Commerce denied the county’s request to spend leftover grant funds after the state’s fiscal year ends on June 30 so this walk-on ferry service could be extended into peak tourist season in July.
What could the future bring for San Juan Islands foot ferry service?
Passengers who use the free foot ferry will be surveyed to provide the county with data that it can then use to make the case for a permanent service, if that seems justified.
An ongoing passenger-only run would require a big subsidy if the fares were to be kept reasonable. McVeigh said San Juan County does not currently have the deep pockets to shoulder those operating costs.
San Juan Safaris’ contract to operate the grant-funded temporary foot ferry costs $7,647.50 per day, which adds up quickly to more than half a million dollars for the ten-and-a-half week duration of the pilot project.
Earlier this year at the Legislature, San Juan County council members testified in support of a bill dubbed the Mosquito Fleet Act to launch new, locally operated walk-on ferry routes across Puget Sound. But that proposal was stripped of funding last month and then died in the state Senate at the beginning of April.

Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said the state government is not in a position to subsidize new ferry services in the near to medium term.
“The (2025-27) budget is really focused on making sure that our mainstay Washington State Ferries service is healthy, strong and sustainable,” Liias said in late March.  “We want to make sure that the service we’re providing is top notch again and we’re investing to get there. Passenger service in the future makes sense, but for now we’re focused on the core of WSF service.”
Absent further state support, another option would be federal grant funding. But McVeigh observed the chances of getting that look grim given the current budget-slashing tenor in the nation’s capital.
A third option would be to turn to local voters for approval to create a county transit district with taxing authority, as Kitsap County did previously. However, McVeigh said it is very premature to go down that path.
“We’re not there yet,” McVeigh said. “This is really just proof-of-concept, this pilot. We want to look at the data. We want to see how our constituents feel about this.”
For now, the council chair from Friday Harbor said people should try out the limited-term passenger service and let the county know what they think. It’s use it or lose it time, to paraphrase her.
“It’s a free ferry ride for now,” McVeigh said. “Come, come, come.”

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”













I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity





In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president for business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news, and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A Monday budget conference committee revealed little new information about ongoing negotiations between Republican caucuses, though a bicameral, bipartisan group heard roughly half an hour of public testimony. 
Sen. Ryan Mishler, the chief budget architect for Senate Republicans, squashed any requests for increased funding prior to public input, saying the grim Wednesday budget forecast that projected $2 billion less in spending “speaks for itself.”
“We have some tough decisions to make,” said the Mishawaka Republican. “Please don’t ask for more because the question at this point will be, ‘Who do you want us to take it from?’”
Aside from that early remark, Republicans largely took a back seat for the rest of the hour-long meeting — neither offering comment nor asking many questions. 
  Sen. Fady Qaddoura takes questions from reporters on April 21, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, condemned the GOP members for not commenting on private negotiations during Monday’s meeting. As both chambers have a Republican supermajority, Democrats are often excluded from such discussions. 
“I was extremely disappointed today that would have been — or should have been — a public process to discuss the budget publicly and the solutions … did not occur. We are a public institution serving 6.9 million Hoosiers across the state and the budget process should have been much more transparent,” said Qaddoura. 
Rep. Greg Porter, also a Democrat from Indianapolis, likened it to being given a seat at the “kids table.”
“We know they had a lot of conversations this past weekend. So we have had conversations also and we have brought a solution to our situation,” Porter said, pointing to increases on so-called sin taxes and reducing school choice voucher spending.
In a comment to reporters, Rep. Jeff Thompson — who leads budget negotiations for House Republicans — said that Monday’s meeting was the last opportunity for public comment.
 To raise or to cut Indiana’s taxes?

A smattering of public advocates took the opportunity to make a last-minute appeal before lawmakers, including 16-year-old central Indiana Girl Scout Vera McConnell. 
McConnell, who has appeared before budget writers before during this session, made repealing the state sales tax on menstrual products — also known as the Pink Tax — the goal of her Gold Award, one of Girls Scouts’ highest honors. 
“Women and girls have paid the pink tax, through both good and bad economic times, and it’s no longer a fiscal issue. Rather, it’s a fairness issue,” McConnell said Monday. “We should not profit from the necessary bodily functions of people. The time is now.”










We have some tough decisions to make.


– Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka


The average woman will spend roughly $18,000 over her lifetime on feminine hygiene products like pads and tampons — which are taxed as luxuries and not as a medical necessity. These dollars contribute $5.6 million in sales taxes to state coffers, or 0.01% of the budget. 
House Republicans struck the tax in their version of the budget but Senate Republicans reversed course — much to the chagrin of their Democratic counterparts, who tried to amend it back into the budget last week but failed on a largely party-line vote. 
McConnell’s effort will have a difficult time getting over the finish line following last week’s budget forecast. Other testimony used that news to try to push forward a long-sought tax increase on cigarettes. 
According to the American Lung Association, only a dozen states tax cigarettes at a lower rate than Indiana, which has the lowest tax of its surrounding states at $0.995 per pack. That is nearly half the national rate of $1.93. 
Tiffany Nichols, the Indiana director of advocacy for the American Lung Association, pushed for a $2 increase, which could bring in an estimated $800 million in tax revenue. However, that number doesn’t include smokeless tobacco products, cigars or vapes — all of which are taxed at a lower rate.

Nichols urged lawmakers to bring taxes for those in line with cigarette cartons.
“We know from decades of research that increasing tobacco taxes is one of the most effective ways to reduce use,” said Nichols. “We must close this loophole. Creating barriers across all tobacco products ensures a consistent public health message: all tobacco products are harmful.”
Increasing such a tax would, ideally, only generate a temporary bump in revenues as tobacco use goes down. However, reducing Hoosier tobacco use would lower the state’s overall health costs — especially for Medicaid, which is the fastest-growing line item. 
The House has passed such an increase a handful of times but never gotten the Senate onboard. Previously, legislative leaders said all options are on the table with the exception of marijuana legalization and an expansion of gaming taxes. 
Raising so-called sin taxes — which can include alcohol in addition to cigarettes and gaming — was at the heart of Democrat suggestions for addressing the $2 billion budget shortfall. 
“We don’t seem to want to tax sin in the way we used to,” lamented Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis.

But the health center’s administrator, Zachary Moser, said a recent decision to freeze family planning funds has the center fearful it won’t be able to continue covering family planning services for its rural southeastern Missouri population.
In late March, the Trump administration froze about $27.5 million in Title X funding to a number of states, including several million dollars to Missouri that are distributed by Missouri Family Health Council. 
The Title X program was created more than half a century ago as a funding stream to support access to family planning options, including contraceptives, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings related to reproductive health.

While some have speculated the administration was trying to target abortion providers, only seven of the 52 recipients of Title X grants through the Missouri Family Health Council are Planned Parenthood clinics. A breakdown of how funding is distributed between clinics was not made available.
The majority of the recipients are health centers like Moser’s. Moser said in the short-term, Dent County has redirected some general revenues toward family planning services and continues to offer them to patients for free.
“Will we be able to do that indefinitely?” he asked. “No.”
For example, instead of Title X funding covering the cost of an IUD — a contraceptive device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy — the patient would instead have to foot the bill, choose a less-effective but more affordable or go without. 
Moser said some of the longer-lasting contraceptive devices can cost upwards of $1,000 out of pocket, a price that isn’t feasible for most of the people the center serves. 
Limiting or eliminating family planning services can impact entire communities and public health. 
Michelle Trupiano, executive director of the Missouri Family Health Council, said if the freeze continues, she anticipates immediate health consequences like increased unintended pregnancies, later-stage cancer diagnoses, more overall disease and worse maternal health outcomes. 
Missouri Family Health Council has been leading the state’s Title X planning program for nearly 45 years. Their network of 52 clinics includes health departments, community action agencies, federally-qualified health centers and hospital-based clinics. They also work with family planning clinics, including seven Planned Parenthood locations.
“The Trump administration and Elon Musk are using Title X to push their own political agenda and impose their personal beliefs on everyone at the expense of people who need critical access to care,” Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. ” …. If blocking health care for low-income patients is what the Trump administration means by ‘making America great again,’ then we want no part of it. It’s cruel, it’s calculated, and it won’t stop us from fighting for our patients.” 
Trupiano said she’s not sure why Missouri was targeted while other states with Planned Parenthood clinics were left untouched. But the letter Trupiano received announcing the freeze cited compliance concerns around diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI. She said the grant they were awarded includes “access, quality and equity” among its priorities. 
Through Title X funding, Missouri clinics served nearly 34,800 patients in 2024. Of those, 83% were female, 75% were under the age of 34 and 45% were uninsured.
Last year, 58% of the patients served were white and 30% were Black. 
“We know the devastating impact and consequences that will result if this is not swiftly resolved,” Trupiano said.
The funding to Missouri Family Health Council was paused the day before year four of a five-year grant cycle began on April 1. 
The Dent County Health Center applied for Title X funding after hiring a full-time nurse practitioner in 2022. Not only does the grant help them increase health care access for patients, but Moser said it also backs up an ongoing effort to inform more young people on pregnancy prevention. 
In his corner of southeast Missouri there’s still a lot of stigma around premarital sex, Moser said, making it difficult to educate teenagers on pregnancy-prevention. Among those teens who do seek out contraceptive access at the health center, he said many don’t want to go through their parent’s insurance policy because they want to keep their choices private. 
“We won’t have any way to serve those patients,” Moser said. “It’s going to limit access for sure, which is going to drive up the teen pregnancy rate, drive up unwanted pregnancies and have other unintended consequences.”
Missouri’s teen pregnancy birth rate has steadily declined over the past several years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though it still remains among the highest in the country.
Stephanie Kraft Sheley, director of Right By You, a Missouri-based nonprofit that in part advocates for contraceptive access, said some of the most common calls to the organization’s hotline revolve around navigating birth control access.
She said a continued freeze could have “catastrophic” effects, potentially shuttering programs or clinics whose efforts help reduce unintended pregnancies.
If the freeze continues, Kraft Sheley said, that likely means navigating fewer people to pregnancy-prevention options and increasingly directing them to abortion options. While abortion is now legal in Missouri, access is still difficult for many people, as only three Planned Parenthood clinics have resumed procedural abortions and medication abortions remain unavailable.
Missouri abortion ban clears House, heads to Senate despite concerns from top Republican

Trupiano has spent the past few weeks helping clinics like Moser’s navigate the abrupt funding change as they work to determine how to stretch resources in order to continue providing free family planning services to patients. 
“They already were working in the leanest possible way to provide this critical care,” she said. “These cuts are very devastating, and for a lot of the health departments and other safety net clinics, this isn’t the only infrastructure cut that they are facing.” 
That rings true in Dent County, where Moser said Title X is one of a handful of programs under threat right now. He remains particularly concerned about continued federal funding for the county’s lead testing and vaccine programs, both of which rely entirely on grant funding.
Trupiano and others have been drawing attention to Missouri’s public health safety net for years, raising concerns that clinics and providers are stretched beyond capacity. Funding freezes such as this only cause longer wait times and more people who ultimately go without timely care as the burden shifts off one clinic and onto another, she said. 
For example, if a clinic relying on Title X funding were ultimately to close, those patients would be forced to find another provider. In many places, new patient wait lists are already months long. For those without reliable access to transportation, getting to a different clinic further away might be too much of a burden to continue care.
While the greatest harm will be inflicted on the most vulnerable Missourians, Trupiano said, “the impact is going to be borne by everybody.”

“It is going to be a funeral instead of an anniversary,” owner Liz Ross said in a phone interview describing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. “I am beyond devastated.”

Co-owner Liz Ross said President Trump’s tariffs will put the company out of business. Photo courtesy of CoolSnowGlobesThis story by Patrick O’Grady was first published in the Valley News on April 20.WINDSOR — Liz Ross and her husband, David Westby, had been eagerly anticipating the 25th anniversary of their business, CoolSnowGlobes, with Ross planning to celebrate the occasion with a coffee table book featuring the company’s product line including an anniversary globe.Now, they are wondering if the business will have to close.“It is going to be a funeral instead of an anniversary,” Ross said in a phone interview describing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. “I am beyond devastated.”Ross said Trump’s decision to slap Chinese imports with a 145% percent tariff will raise her costs beyond what can be absorbed by the business.“We cannot sustain our business with tariffs and extortion provided by the thug in the White House,” Ross said in an email. “Heartbreaking is an understatement.”For the last 20 years, CoolSnowGlobes, whose products are designed in the U.S. by Ross and Westby and made in China, has shipped about 50,000 snow globes annually to customers around the world, including ballet companies, museums and large corporations. If the tariffs remain, Ross said shipments will stop once their current inventory in the U.S. is sold.“We will have nothing left to sell after we sell what is in our warehouse because of the tariffs,” Ross said. “To raise tariffs to 145% is untenable. Even 50% and we are done. On top of that, we have merchandise that has already been produced that we have to pay for but can’t afford to bring in because of the tariffs.”Ross said she has contacted Vermont U.S. Senators Peter Welch and Bernie Sanders and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, suggesting a pause in the tariffs for small businesses importing less than $1 million or $500,000 annually.“If the tariffs could be suspended, we could survive,” Ross said.Raising the price of the globes, now about $60 each, to offset the higher costs caused by tariffs and maintain a profit margin is out of the question, Ross said.“We are the only company in the world that does this, so we really have no competition,” she said. “But that doesn’t mean we can support 145% tariffs, and that is today. It may go to 185%. No one is going to pay $150 to $200 for a snow globe.”Ross was living in California when she came up with an idea for snow globes and created 12 designs. Initially, she licensed the designs but took the license back and now handles all aspects of the selling process. About 25% of the business are custom designs — 12 to 15 projects a year — and 75% their own designs. They work with freelance three-dimensional modelers who create the prototypes for production. CoolSnowGlobes has agreements with two family-owned factories in China. In addition, all of the raw materials come from China. The globes are handmade and hand-painted with a variety of themes and images.“We have been working with them for 25 years and have a great relationship,” Ross said of the two factories.The couple, which have been based in Windsor since 2006, has three employees in administrative roles, and Ross worries they will lose their jobs and the freelancers will lose work from CoolSnowGlobesRoss said they considered making the globes in Vermont but, after researching the cost, realized it would have been “prohibitively expensive,” so they stayed in China.Tim Tierney, Director of Recruitment and International Trade at the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said that while most knew higher tariffs were coming, no one predicted 145% on Chinese imports and 125% on exports to China.What he is hearing from Vermont businesses is that some are trying to renegotiate contracts with their Chinese suppliers.“People in China don’t want to lose business as well, so it is both sides of the story,” Tierney said. “That is basically the only tactic they can take other than raising prices on their customers.”Other businesses, Tierney said, are exploring other manufacturers or suppliers outside of China, but there is time and expense to securing new agreements and finding alternative supply chains.“Those are some of the avenues people are pursuing: Renegotiate or find another affordable manufacturer in another country,” Tierney said.The undercurrent of uncertainty about how long the tariffs will last and whether they might increase has made it more difficult for companies to create a plan for their future. Tierney said he knew of a company that was traveling to other nations looking for new production facilities.“But there is a time and expense to find the same quality,” he said.Ross said she is not sure what will happen next with her business and a pause in the tariffs is the best she can hope for now.“We are going to die,” Ross said. “No way can we sustain the business with 145% tariffs. It is kind of shocking to think that the government is killing my business after 25 years.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Windsor snow globe business fears Trump tariffs.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/snow-globes.jpg?fit=738%2C500&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Taylor, which asks if Montgomery County parents have a religious right to opt children out of classes that use LGBTQ+ friendly books. But advocates say the case has national implications.","The U.S. Supreme Court. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)When the Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in Mahmoud v. Taylor, it will be considering whether Montgomery County parents have a right, on religious grounds, to opt their children out of classes in county schools that use LGBTQ+ friendly books.
But to the scores of religious, legal and educational groups across the country who have filed friend-of-the-court briefs, it’s a case with national implications.
“Whatever rule the Court promulgates in this case will apply far beyond the circumstances of this dispute,” says a 30-page brief filed on behalf of the School Superintendents Association, Consortium of State School Boards Associations, Council of the Great City Schools and National School Attorneys Association. That brief does not support either side in the dispute, but asks the justices to tread carefully.
Most of the other briefs, however, are decidedly on one side or the other: With the parents who argue that the county policy infringes on their right to raise their children according to their religion, or with the school board that says the books are part of an inclusive curriculum and are not coercive or targeting any religion.
The case began at the start of the 2022-23 school year, when the county unveiled a list of “LGBTQ+-inclusive texts for use in the classroom,” including books for grades as low as kindergarten and pre-K. After initially saying that parents could opt their children out of lessons that included those and other books, the school board reversed course in March 2023 and said opt-outs would not be allowed beginning in the 2023-24 school year.
Parents are allowed to opt their children out of parts of sex education classes, but not other parts of the curriculum, like language arts.
The parents sued the school board in May 2023, saying the inability to opt their children out of the classes infringes on their First Amendment freedom of religion rights. They also wanted the schools to notify them when lessons involving the books were coming up, and to plan alternative lessons for their children.
But school officials claim the books were not part of “explicit instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation in elementary school, and that no student or adult is asked to change how they feel about these issues.”
In its December filing that urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, the county said, “MCPS (Montgomery County Public Schools) believes that representation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a fully inclusive environment for all students and supports a student’s ability to empathize, connect, and collaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for all.” It went on to say “teachers are not permitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular viewpoint.”
Lower courts have rejected the parents request for a preliminary injunction, with a divided panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the county policy did not have the coercion required to make it a burden on religious exercise.
In their petition to the Supreme Court, the parents cited a few of the elementary-aged books the school board includes as “LGBTQ-inclusive” and the guidance for teachers that went with each:

“Born Ready,” a story about Penelope, a student who identifies as a boy. “Teachers are told to instruct students that, at birth, doctors guess about our gender, but we know ourselves best”;
“Love, Violet,” a story about two young girls and their same-sex playground romance. “Teachers are encouraged to have a think-aloud moment to ask students how it feels when they don’t just like but like like someone”; and
“Intersection Allies,” a picture book for children to ponder what it means to be “transgender” or “non-binary” and asks, “what pronouns fit you?”

Mark Graber, a regents professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey Law School in Baltimore, said in an interview Monday that a Supreme Court decision in favor of the petitioners, or parents, would create “an administrative nightmare.”
“There are a lot of religions out there. Schools have to figure out what violates religion, what parents they have to contact,” he said.
Graber said the court will have to determine whether county teaches the topics “as secular” subjects.
“The parent has the right to go in and say, ‘What are you teaching?’ Public schools can teach one plus one equals two, regardless of what your religion says about the simpleness of mathematics,” he said. “They can teach about different forms of couples, regardless of what religion says about the simpleness of different kinds of relationships.
“The crucial thing is public schools must teach it as secular,” he said. “They may not praise or condemn any religion for holding opinions consistent with the public schools, or inconsistent.”
Even though parents have lost in lower courts on their preliminary injunction request, Graber said it makes senses for them to press the case with the current Supreme Court, given the justices’ openness to free exercise claims.
“The court has been extraordinarily sympathetic to free exercise claims brought by evangelical Christians,” he said. “They think they got the most sympathetic court they’ve ever had, so why not [petition the court]?”
‘Case is very important’
The fact the high court will be hearing the case based only “on an undeveloped and untested, preliminary injunction record,” and not hearings on the full merits of case in lower courts, was concerning to the school groups that filed the brief in support of neither side of the case.
“There are great risks presented by asking the Court to potentially adopt new rules for evaluating Free Exercise claims or constitutionalizing notice and opt out requirements,” said the brief from the School Superintendents Association, Consortium of State School Boards Associations, Council of the Great City Schools and National School Attorneys Association.
One other brief that supports neither side in the dispute came from the California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM), a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that focuses on “eradicating the disparaging treatment of Hinduism” in that state’s public schools.
The organization’s brief proposes the court adopt a four-part test to determine if school policies violate free exercise rights: Does the curriculum material negate religious beliefs or practices?; does the curriculum material itself or the process through which it was adopted reflect targeted hostility toward religion or a particular religion?; does the material or the adoption process lack neutrality toward a particular religion?; and is the curriculum material coercive?
“The outcome of this case is going to clearly affect my client’s rights, but whatever test the court comes up with … we have ideas in what would make sense in litigating the case,” Glenn Katon, counsel representing CAPEEM, said in an interview Monday.
“We’re not there to help either party. We’re there to try and get the court to adopt the test that makes sense, that will help Hindus get treated fairly in California,” he said. “This case is very important for schools in California [and] even across the country.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/US-Supreme-Court-1-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

The bill would eliminate all state taxes on capital gains, or profits from selling investments such as corporate stock, real estate, antiques and artwork. No state with an income tax fully exempts capital gains, in no small part because doing so would let wealthy people collect tax-free passive income while continuing to tax middle class workers and people whose savings are in retirement accounts.
Nearly two-thirds of capital gains that Missourians report on their federal tax forms flows to households with incomes over a half-million dollars per year.
There are ample grounds for debating this proposal but one that has come to the forefront is how much it will carve from the state’s budget. The state’s Department of Revenue estimated the cost at $111 million per year. Nobody doubts that the department has access to good data. But tax analysis is hard, and it’s not unusual for people working with good data to reach the wrong result. Every piece of publicly available data I’ve unearthed points to that being the case here.
While Missouri is less transparent than most states in how it publishes basic tax statistics, IRS data on Missourians’ federal tax filings, and the real-world experience of states with similar policies show that Missouri will confront a revenue hit many times larger than the department predicts.
First, consider the IRS data. In 2022, Missourians reported more than $13.3 billion in capital gains on their federal tax forms. If those gains were taxed at the state’s top rate of 4.7%, this would mean that a capital gains exemption would cost $600 million or more — a far cry from $111 million.
To be fair, this calculation is a simplification of reality, as department staff pointed out to The Independent when asked earlier this month.
Social Security income is fully exempt from Missouri tax, for example, and retirees who worked in the public sector can exclude their pensions as well. These policies may push some capital gains recipients into lower tax brackets and reduce the cost of a new exemption.
But the IRS data are clear that most gains flow to Missourians with exceptionally high incomes who are surely facing the state’s top marginal tax rate. Even if the average tax rate on capital gains was somehow half the top rate, the exemption would still cost almost three times the department’s estimate.
Tellingly, this simplified math works well in other states that have lowered taxes on capital gains. In Wisconsin, South Carolina, and Montana, official estimates for capital gains provisions all come within 30% of the estimate arrived at by applying the top rate to the IRS capital gains data. Only in Missouri does the Department of Revenue estimate so widely diverge from IRS data.
It is also possible to evaluate the department’s estimate another way. The department suggests that individual income tax revenue will decline by just 1.2% if capital gains are exempted.
But in Wisconsin, South Carolina and Montana, capital gains tax preferences that are about half as generous as the Missouri proposal are reducing income tax revenue by 3 to 4.9% per year. When we adjust the data from these states to reflect a Missouri-sized exemption, the result is a revenue loss between 5.2 and 8.5% of current revenues — four to seven times larger than the department predicts.
Although there are many possible explanations for the low estimate, public statements by the department offer two possible clues.
First, the department notes that some capital gains Missourians report on their federal forms may be taxed by other states. While true, this is not a compelling explanation because the effect cuts both ways. Missouri residents sometimes pay tax on capital gains to other states, and nonresidents sometimes pay tax on capital gains to Missouri. These two things typically come close to canceling out.
Some press reports suggest the department thinks nonresidents would be ineligible for the exemption. This is not apparent in the bill language and, even if it was, it would not matter because that design would be struck down in court as a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s interstate commerce clause.
If the department failed to consider the impact on nonresidents, that could lead to an understated revenue estimate. In Montana, for example, nonresidents receive one in every six dollars of that state’s capital gains tax preference.
Second, the department notes that many high-income people purchase tax credits that offset some or all of their tax liability. That is also true but it doesn’t explain why the estimate is so low and, in fact, it presents exactly the kind of wrinkle that could cause someone working with the right data to reach the wrong conclusion.
Imagine a high-income investor who purchases transferable credits to reduce or eliminate their Missouri tax liability. If capital gains become tax-exempt, they will have less tax liability and will purchase fewer credits. A recalculation of this person’s tax bill would show little change in state revenue because the taxpayer will simply switch from claiming one tax break (transferable credits) to claiming a different one instead (the new capital gains exemption).
But it’s essential to acknowledge that those credits will be transferred elsewhere. If the department did not hold transferable credits constant in its analysis, it would reach an incorrect answer.
While it’s not possible to pinpoint with certainty what may have gone wrong with the department’s analysis, every publicly available datapoint suggests that the true cost of this tax cut for high-income investors will be many times larger than estimated.
In other words, exempting capital gains would take an extra half-billion dollar bite out of the state budget, beyond what lawmakers have been told.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/dollar-wave.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A Republican senator detailed changes to a contentious sex education bill on Monday, including deletion of a proposed requirement for K-12 schools to teach about consent.
The last-minute edits to Senate Bill 442 were announced during a 13-minute conference committee meeting. Public testimony was allowed but none was provided.
The conference committee proposal had not been signed and officially approved as of Monday evening, however, meaning the bill’s provisions could still change.
Earlier versions of the legislation required any materials used to teach “human sexuality” for grades 4-12 be approved by a school board and include instruction on “the importance of consent to sexual activity.”
The latest proposed draft retained a mandate for districts to publish a list of materials used in connection with instruction on human sexuality. Bill author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, said tweaks were also made to requirements surrounding permission forms that must be sent to parents about such instruction.
Expected to stay in the bill, too, are requirements for elementary school students to watch a three-minute ultrasound video of fetal development if they participate in human sexuality coursework.
Byrne said he preferred to let school boards decide if local curricula include topics on consent.
“(Teaching about consent) can still happen. We’re just not going to require that in this bill,” he said. “This is a sensitive subject for many. I believe it may be different thoughts in different communities, and … this leaves, for the most part, local control on making those decisions.”
Brief discussion among lawmakers drew continued concerns from House and Senate Democrats on the committee.
“I don’t understand how we could possibly not agree to teach that as part of human sexuality,” said Rep. Tonya Pfaff, D-Terre Haute. “For consent, it protects both boy and girl — man and woman. We are talking about teenagers that sometimes don’t learn that they can say no.”
The introduction of sex education usually starts in the fourth grade, according to state guidelines. But Indiana does not require the course in schools. Instead, it only mandates that schools teach lessons on HIV and AIDS. Schools that do teach sex education are expected to focus on abstinence.
Critics of the bill have argued that school boards already have the authority to review and approve curricular materials. State law further requires school corporations to make instructional materials available to parents so that they can consent to instruction on human sexuality.

This is a portion of Montana Highway 253 between Terry and Circle, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick for the Daily Montanan). There has been a lot of focus on mental health issues in Montana during the past few years, specifically aimed toward marginalized groups like the LGTBQ community and indigenous peoples. And for good reason. But one statistic that might surprise people is that a high percentage of the suicides in Montana occur in the farming and ranching community, among middle-aged men. 
Courtney Kibblewhite grew up in Huntley, where her grandparents owned a ranch, but her father also worked at the Northern Ag Network, the radio station founded by former Sen. Conrad Burns in 1975. Courtney’s father started working there just out of college, and he eventually bought the business, which is now family run. Courtney is now the vice president of the corporation. But her family was always involved in the ranch, and it is still in the family, now run by Courtney’s brother, so she knows the culture well. And it is because of that connection, as well as her position at the radio station, that Courtney decided to find a way to bring more focus to the mental health issues that face the agricultural community in Montana. 
Courtney’s journey back to Montana and the radio station was a circuitous one that included going to college at Northwestern University in Chicago, followed by a couple of years in Uganda, and a year studying yoga in India. She met her husband Jonny, who is Welsh, in Thailand. But it was a difficult year even before these adventures that first inspired her to leave Montana, when she and her parents decided that a change of scenery might be beneficial. Some of Courtney’s cousins, who lived on a ranch near Birney, had attended a boarding school in Maryland and liked it there, so Courtney packed her bags and moved to Maryland, which turned out to be a very good experience.
“It wasn’t as if they provided me with any mental health resources, but I think it was just good for me to get out of my own head for a while. There were girls from all over the world at this school, so it was a great atmosphere,” she said.
It was that early awareness of mental health issues that inspired Courtney’s interest in the topic, which has led to the creation of Beyond the Weather, a program designed to provide help for farmers and ranchers who are dealing with depression or anxiety, or any other number of mental health issues. 
It has long been an established fact that Montana ranks in the top five in suicide, every year, and like so many families in Montana, Courtney’s family has a story about that, where one of her relatives was missing for several days, and neighbors went to investigate, only to discover that he had shot his wife and two kids before taking his own life. Sadly, it’s not an uncommon story in our state, and because of that, Courtney and several of her colleagues decided to record interviews with farmers and ranchers around the state who have faced mental health issues and gotten help for them. 
About the same time that Courtney began to explore this idea, the Montana Department of Agriculture received some American Rescue Fund dollars, as did every state in the union, that were to be directed toward “agriculture stress.” The Department of Agriculture utilized that money to fund three different approaches. If a rural community brought in a speaker to talk about mental health issues, the department would fund that. They also put $500,000 into a free counseling program for farmers and ranchers, through Frontier Psychiatry. And the third was Courtney’s  project to help promote the counseling program, but also to create these videos that would combat the stigma that is so prevalent among rural Montanans about getting help.  
The department wanted Courtney and her team to come up with a different name for their program, in order to avoid scaring people away with the mental-health label, which is how they came up with “Beyond the Weather,” which obviously refers to the fact that conversation in rural communities so often revolves around the weather. 
Like most Montana families, Courtney’s family struggled with having conversations about emotional topics, as evidenced by the fact that she didn’t even know about this horrific family tragedy for years, nor did she know that her grandfather’s second wife had once been married to one of his ranch hands. 
“It gave me a whole new perspective on my grandfather when I learned the story of his brother killing his family and himself, because when you go through something like that, and you live in a place where those kinds of things are discussed, it’s only natural that you would look for comfort somehow, either through drinking, or like he did, with someone else’s wife. The way that this kind of trauma affects so many families in Montana just doesn’t go away.”
Beyond the Weather features interviews with several ranchers and their spouses about issues of grief, stress, loss of a loved one, and depression, and as one young rancher, Travis Stuber, states so honestly, “I’m not a touchy feely guy, so this doesn’t come naturally to me, but I also know that as ranchers and farmers, the stigma around this stuff is weakness, and that’s the last thing we want to show is weakness. So I had to learn that it’s OK to be affected by loss. I lost my best friend and my mother in the past few years, and as my counselor pointed out when I said I was struggling with the loss of my mom, hey, that’s OK. Think about your mom and don’t bottle that up and throw it away.”
Not long after the COVID pandemic, a survey done by local law enforcement showed a huge spike in incidents of domestic violence in Montana, with an especially troubling rise in reports where one family member tried to strangle another. The isolation of ranching and farming, along with the stigma attached to asking for help, has long been a deterrent toward Montanas getting help for whatever mental health issues they are battling.

(File photo from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)State transportation officials said they are working on strategies to protect the two bridges over the Chesapeake Bay following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
The response from Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld comes a month after the National Transportation Safety Board called for nearly six dozen bridges nationwide to undergo collapse-risk evaluations.
Wiedefeld, in a letter to NTSB officials released Monday, said the Maryland Transportation Administration “is developing a comprehensive risk reduction plan” for the two crossings over the bay.
Some of the short-term strategies could include new communications requirements for ship pilots, reduced speeds, one-way transits and managing vehicle traffic on the bridge, according to the response letter.
Longer-term strategies could include physical measures to prevent a strike.
In a statement, the Maryland Transportation Authority, which oversees toll bridges, including the former Francis Scott Key and Chesapeake Bay Bridges, spent $160 million last spring to study bridge protection at the Bay Bridge spans even though the agency was “not obligated to do so under the law.”
The review, conducted by Moffatt & Nichol, was performed as the agency looks at the long-term possibility of replacing the existing spans over the bay.
Maryland officials mark one year since collapse of Key Bridge

The NTSB released a report in March as part of its ongoing review of the allision that caused the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, 2024. In that incident, the Dali, a 984-foot-long cargo ship flagged in Singapore, struck the bridge. The resulting collapse killed six people — all of whom were construction workers assigned to a detail on the span over the Patapsco River.
In its report, the NTSB said the state had failed to conduct a critical risk assessment on the bridge despite increases in both the amount and size of ship traffic in the channel. The agency said had the state conducted such an assessment, it would have found the risk for a collapse was 30 times greater than the current industry standard.
The safety board’s March report called on state transportation officials to use updated industry standards to determine the probability of a bridge collapse.
Wiedefeld, in his letter to the NTSB, said the consultants for the transportation administration “conclude the Bay Bridges do not meet the … risk threshold for new bridges.”
The board also recommended the state develop short- and long-term strategies to reduce the likelihood of a collapse caused by maritime traffic.
Michael Shields, an associate professor for civil and systems engineering at Johns Hopkins University, said in a statement that the results of the risk assessment commissioned by state transportation officials “which find that the Bay Bridge does not meet the (transportation industry’s) risk threshold for new bridges, are not surprising” given the university’s own analysis released a month ago.
Shields leads the university’s assessment of bridge vulnerabilities.
The standard for collisions that could cause a collapse should be measured in thousands of years, according to the university study. The Key Bridge would have been in the top 10 most vulnerable in the country, using that standard.
That analysis projected the Chesapeake Bay Bridge could expect a catastrophic collision every 86 years. That placed it in the top 12 in the Hopkins analysis.
The east-bound span opened in 1952, making it more than 70 years old. The west-bound span, opened in June 1972, would be more than 50 years old.
“Nonetheless, the MDTA’s stated commitment to invest in both short-term and long-term protections for the bridge are positive developments that will improve safety and reduce risk,” Shields said in his statement.

The pope died Monday at age 88.","Pope Francis, in an Aug. 3, 2023, photo from a visit to Portugal for World Youth Day. (Photo by Antonio Cotrim - Pool/Getty Images)Leaders from the worlds of church and state in Maryland remembered Pope Francis Monday for his humility and his advocacy for the poor and marginalized, with some sharing personal stories of meeting the pontiff. The pope died Monday at age 88, the Vatican announced.
“Pope Francis – the People’s Pope – led with humility, compassion, and love for all people,” said Gov. Wes Moore (D) in a statement that ordered flags flown at half-staff in memory of the pope.”I will be forever grateful for his spiritual leadership and the legacy he leaves behind. Dawn and I join millions across Maryland, our country, and the world in mourning his passing.”
President Donald Trump also ordered U.S. flags lowered to half-staff in memory of the pope. Both the U.S. and state flags will stay at half-staff until sunset on the day the pope is interred. A date for the funeral is expected to be set Tuesday, at the first gathering of cardinals after the pope’s death, the Vatican announced.
Washington Archbishop Robert McElroy and his predecessor, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, are among the 10 U.S. cardinals who will join 125 other cardinals from around the world who will meet in Rome to select the next pope in the coming weeks. McElroy said in a statement Monday that Francis, the first pope from Latin America, showed his roots while ministering directly to the sick, the incarcerated and the needy.
“It was in these intimate moments of pastoral care that we saw with such poignancy the heart of the pastor who had embodied mercy and love to the suffering in Buenos Aires and refused to diminish that commitment even when the strictures of the papacy fell upon him,” McElroy wrote. The Archdiocese of Washington includes Montgomery, Prince George’s, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties.
Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori, who said he planned to travel to the pope’s funeral, recalled his visits with Francis Monday.
“Often the Holy Father would ask visitors to pray for him. I am sure he would want us to pray for him now that he may rest in the peace of the Risen Lord,” Lori wrote.
In his statement, Lori recalled previous visits with Francis, including one occasion when seminarians from Baltimore gifted Francis, “an avid sports fan,” with a Baltimore Ravens jersey.
“Throughout the years of his pontificate, Pope Francis manifested his love for the poor and marginalized. He lifted up the plight of migrants and refugees, victims of injustice, the sick and elderly, and global poverty,” Lori wrote.
Francis became pope in 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, the first pope in centuries to resign rather than die in the position. Born Jose Mario Bergoglio to Italian parents in Argentina, he became the first Latin American and the first Jesuit elevated to the papacy.
Francis called upon the cardinals to bring the church “to the peripheries, not only geographically, but also the existential peripheries: the mystery of sin, of pain, of injustice, of ignorance and indifference to religion, of intellectual currents and all misery.”
“His desire to bring the church to the peripheries has been witnessed to by the more than 45 papal trips he made over the 12 years of his papacy,”said Wilmington Bishop William E. Koenig in a statement Monday.
Koenig highlighted Francis’s comments on Easter Sunday, from what would be his final address in St. Peter’s Square. Francis said that the story of Jesus and his resurrection “fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end.”
“It is with this sure and certain hope that we entrust our beloved Holy Father into the ‘strong and mighty hand’ of God,” wrote Koenig, whose diocese includes Maryland’s Eastern Shore.
A memorial service for Francis is scheduled for April 28  at 12:10 p.m. at the Cathedral of St. Peter in Wilmington.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) remembered Francis as a “champion for a more just world,” and highlighted the pope’s Easter remarks as proof of his support for migrants like Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported last month from Maryland and held ever since in a prison in his native El Salvador. Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia, has been fighting with the White House for weeks to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. to be tried by courts here.
“Trump’s cronies said we ‘wasted Easter Sunday’ in discussing Mr. Abrego Garcia & their violation of his constitutional rights,” Van Hollen wrote on X. “We were in good company w/ Pope Francis, who on Easter decried ‘contempt’ for immigrants & has called on them to do better.”
Francis was a deender of immigrants to Europe and the U.S., recently speaking out about the treatment of immigrants in the United States.
“The act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,” Francis wrote in a recent letter to U.S. bishops.
One of the pope’s last visits was from Vice President J.D. Vance, a recent Catholic convert who was in Italy to meet with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. No politics were discussed in that brief meeting, and Vance extended condolences in a social media post.
“I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill,” said Vance, who said he will always remember the pope for a homily in the early days of pandemic in which he called on people to “be not afraid” but to have faith.
Others remembered the pope from his 2015 trip to the U.S., when he visited New York, Washington and Philadelphia. It was during that trip that Francis became the first pope to address a joint session of Congress.
Maryland Rep. April McClain Delaney (D) said she was “blessed to be in his presence” twice when the pope visited Washington in 2015. She shared a video of then-President Barack Obama (D) introducing Francis to a large crowd.
“Modeling the fruits of the spirit, the Pope gave an antidote to our present world. May he rest in peace and serve to remind us to shine God‘s light in good work and compassion,” McClain Delaney wrote on X.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), Maryland’s only Republican in Congress, also shared condolences Monday, writing that he and his wife, Nicole “send prayers of strength to those in grief. May his legacy of ministry and charity continue to be an inspiration to us all. Rest in peace.”
Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), said he met with Francis after he was diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma during his first term as governor. Hogan, who is a Catholic, said he asked Francis to pray for all those battling cancer.
“He responded with such kindness and sincerity — taking a moment to pray with me personally. It was an encounter filled with comfort, strength, and grace, and it is something I will never forget,” Hogan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1574192435-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-22 07:08:39.935315

Photo by Andrew KennardThe exoneration of David and Robert Bintz in a 1987 murder case has increased attention on what happens in Wisconsin after defendants’  convictions are overturned and they are released from prison. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Wisconsin Claims Board considers compensation claims by innocent people who were convicted of a crime. The board can award up to $25,000, not including attorneys’ fees, and not more than $5,000 for every year of wrongful imprisonment. It can recommend that the state Legislature award additional compensation. 
Re-entering society  
Exonerated people often experience more difficulty accessing services to help them reenter society than people who were released on probation or parole, according to Rachel Burg, co-director of the Wisconsin Innocence Project. 
State programs work with people on probation or parole before release, Burg said, and include pre-release job training, assistance with applications to public benefits and general release planning. After release, a person may have court or supervision-mandated programs, such as school or work requirements. 
“By no means am I saying being on probation or parole is easy or conducive to successfully reentering society, but in theory there is access to resources that are not available to the wrongfully convicted,” Burg said in an email to the Examiner. 
Exonerated people don’t have probation officers making sure they have their identification cards and get set up for Medicaid, she said, or parole agents helping with job applications. 
A guilty person gets more support from the state than an innocent person who was exonerated, Keith Findley, co-founder of the Wisconsin Innocence Project and an emeritus law professor at UW-Madison, said in an interview in November. 
“They’ve spent often decades in prison, had their livelihoods taken away from them, their relationships, their homes, their professions, their good names,” Findley said. “And then when we discover we got it wrong and made a mistake, we just open the door and say, ‘OK, have a good life,’ with nothing more from the state.”
Findley said Wisconsin could create a state forensic science commission, as well as conviction integrity units (CIUs) in prosecutors’ offices. In neighboring Michigan, the CIU in the state attorney general’s office  investigates claims of innocence that are accompanied by new evidence. 
Paths to compensation 
Exonerees in the U.S. may receive compensation through a civil lawsuit, a private bill passed by a state legislature or a state law, if the state has a compensation statute.
Wisconsin’s compensation cap for wrongfully convicted people is one of the lowest caps in the country. The rare exception to the cap is if the Wisconsin Legislature approves a higher amount.
The Wisconsin Claims Board decides whether to grant compensation to an exonerated person and can recommend that the Legislature award an amount higher than the $25,000 cap. 
The members of the Wisconsin Claims Board come from the Wisconsin Senate, the Wisconsin Assembly, the governor’s office, the Wisconsin Department of Justice and the Wisconsin Department of Administration. Currently, the legislative representatives are Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Green Lake) and Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto). 
How much does Wisconsin pay wrongly convicted people?
Wisconsin pays an average of about $4,200 per year of wrongful incarceration to those who filed and received compensation, according to an analysis of data collected by the National Registry of Exonerations,  Wisconsin Watch reported. 
A bipartisan bill that would have increased the $25,000 cap to $1 million passed the Wisconsin State Assembly in 2016, the Capital Times reported. It didn’t become law. The bill would have also granted assistance for  transitioning back into society and up to 10 years in the state’s health insurance program for public employees.
There were 39 states, along with the District of Columbia, with compensation statutes for wrongful imprisonment as of March. 
Some states’ compensation statutes allow exonerees to receive services, like assistance with tuition, job search and housing, Rachel Burg of the Wisconsin Innocence Project said.
As of July 2023, 62 Wisconsin exonerees were wrongly convicted in state courts since 1989 and potentially eligible for compensation, according to a research paper that used information from the National Registry of Exonerations. Jeffrey Gutman of George Washington University Law School published “Compensation under the Microscope: Wisconsin” in 2022, and it was updated in 2023.
As of July 2023, 25 of the 62 had filed claims. 17 of 25 applicants were granted compensation, and 8 were denied.
Gutman wrote that Wisconsin’s filing rate was significantly below a national average of 58% and said that “Wisconsin’s low compensation is a logical explanation.”  
In Findley’s view, Wisconsin’s compensation plan for exonerees “puts a very high burden” on innocent people to prove their innocence.
Wisconsin’s compensation statute does not give compensation to people because they show their conviction was overturned, the claims board said when it denied compensation to Lavontae Stinson in a 2024 decision.
Stinson’s conviction was overturned due to ineffective assistance of his legal counsel, the claims board said. For this to happen, Stinson had to show there was a “reasonable probability” that more effective counsel would have led to a different result.
According to the board’s decision, the Milwaukee County District Attorney decided not to retry Stinson because the state could not meet its burden of proof. According to the DA, additional information from Stinson’s post-conviction counsel “cast some doubt on whether Stinson was involved at all in the crimes for which he was sent to prison.”
To receive compensation, Stinson had to meet a different standard — proving his innocence with “clear and convincing” evidence — and the board ruled his arguments and evidence did not meet the standard.
Rare compensation from the Legislature 
In 2014, then-Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill granting Robert Lee Stinson an additional $90,000. In the end, Stinson was awarded the $115,000 he had requested from the Wisconsin State Claims Board — $5,000 for each year of his imprisonment.
Gutman’s “Compensation Under the Microscope” reported 17 cases of exonerees receiving state compensation, going back to 1989. Stinson’s case appeared to be the only example of the Wisconsin Legislature ordering additional compensation for a wrongfully convicted person following a claims board recommendation, he wrote.
Stinson spent over two decades incarcerated for a conviction based on flawed evidence, FOX6 Milwaukee reported. He settled litigation with the city of Milwaukee for $7.5 million.
Jarrett Adams, an attorney working with David and Robert Bintz, didn’t yet know if the brothers could make a claim for a federal lawsuit, he told the Examiner in late February. Wisconsin’s compensation statute might be the brothers’ only opportunity for compensation, he said. 
In the case of Daryl Holloway, the claims board recommended an additional $975,000 in March 2022, Gutman wrote, and the Legislature hadn’t acted on the recommendation as of June 2023. 
After a 3-2 vote, in a Jan. 30 decision, the board awarded Gabriel Lugo $25,000 in compensation, not including attorneys’ fees. 
Lugo had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a 2008 shooting and released in 2023 after his conviction was vacated. The board recommended that the Legislature award Lugo an additional $750,000.

The Idahoan is the founder of Grove Fruit Growers, which grows mangos in Cambodia and processes them in Vietnam. After the COVID-19 pandemic brought her business to a halt, she moved her product to the Russian market — only to have to be forced out when Russia invaded Ukraine. Then as she worked to readjust her business plans, she was in a car accident that caused a brain injury.

After years of disruptions, she finally solidified buyers in the U.S. But the Trump administration announced 49% tariffs on Cambodia and 46% on Vietnam — targeting the countries where her business operates. While those tariffs are paused until July, if implemented, Carver said it would result in the end of her business. 
Carver said she supports fair trade and believes the U.S. has not “gotten a fair shake with China.” However, she said universal tariffs do not make sense. 
“We don’t even grow mangos in the U.S.,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun. “So it’s not protecting U.S. industry, because it’s just been a blanket tariff put on most of the world. It really wasn’t strategically looked at to say, ‘What industries do we want to protect or support?’ It’s just thrown at mango farmers, which is so bizarre.”
 A mission that’s more than just the mangos

Before becoming the owner of a 110 acre mango farm in Cambodia, Carver lived in Taiwan and owned a small food distribution company exporting nuts and grains from the U.S. into Asia, while her husband worked for Micron. 
In 2018, after her children were assigned a book in school about the Khmer Rouge — Cambodia’s brutal communist regime that killed most of the educated class between 1975 to 1979 and resorted to a rural agricultural society — Carver said she was in awe that this type of genocide had happened in her lifetime. This inspired her to visit the country with her family.
Upon visiting, she noticed piles of mangos in the countryside.
“I asked why, and they said they can’t find buyers,” she said. “I have this food distribution company, so I was like, ‘Oh, I can connect them to buyers.’”
It took years of geopolitical hurdles and receiving funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development — which the Trump administration dissolved earlier this year — to get a hold on the U.S. market. She can finally sell frozen fruit to retailers, and she is in the process of meeting with dried fruit buyers from major retailers and small grocery stories alike. 
Carver, who has a master’s degree from Harvard in sustainable global development, said her business is more than just about selling mangos. 
“It’s about development,” she said. “It’s about bringing people out of poverty in Cambodia, but also making a business case for me.”
Retailers are interested in the mission behind her business, Carver said, but if these tariffs go into effect, then the business is done. 
“I’m just so deflated,” she said. “I’ve spent so much money. We’ve spent just under a million dollars on this project, just of our own money, not only from getting grants. So, I think I might just be done.”

 Do tariffs work, and why Southeast Asia? 

During Trump’s first term, he began setting tariffs on China to punish it for what he called unfair trade practices. So who won that trade war? 
It wasn’t the U.S. or China — it was Vietnam, according to Rob Dayley, a political economy professor and Southeast Asia expert at the College of Idaho.
“Those first term tariffs merely incentivized companies to move production from China to other low-cost production countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, countries that then were not in the crosshairs,” Dayley told the Idaho Capital Sun. 
To close that loophole 2025, the Trump administration chose to implement universal tariffs on nearby countries to China. Because those tariffs were so high and disruptive in global confidence of the U.S., President Donald Trump backtracked from his “Liberation Day” tariff rates, Dayley said, adding that the broader promises of the tariff policy — reducing deficits, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and lowering inflation — is “just not going to happen.”
There is no historical data to support that tariff policies will produce those positive outcomes, he said.
“The idea that manufacturers of shoes, toys, clothing, and other low-skill products would somehow decide to reshore production to Des Moines or Boise because of some import tariffs was unrealistic during Trump’s first term and remains unrealistic in his second term,” Dayley said. 
While it makes sense to protect national security industries, such as semi-conductors or other defense-related technologies, Dayley said it doesn’t make sense to punish fruit industries that are not grown in the U.S. If farms, like the Grove Fruit Growers, cannot make a profit, they’ll stop sending their products to the U.S. market, he said. 
“If Americans only want to exclude all foreign pineapple or mangos from our U.S. grocery stores (be it fresh, canned, or frozen), then prepare to eat Hawaiian pineapple or mangos at much higher prices,” he said. “When supply goes down, prices go up. It’s that simple.”

Oilfield executive takes charge of consolidating workforce of 70,000 at national parks, BLM, Fish and Wildlife Service.
The post Despite DOGE at Interior, Yellowstone staffing ‘higher than last year’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Five days into the Trump administration’s DOGE takeover of the Department of Interior’s policy, management and budget, Yellowstone National Park staffing is “higher than last year,” an Interior Department spokesperson in Washington, D.C. said Monday.
​​Yellowstone Park confirmed the increase. “Going into this year, we should have a total of 769 NPS employees,” park spokeswoman Linda Veress said in an email, up from 748 last year. During the park’s record year for visitation in 2021, the park’s workforce numbered 693 permanent and seasonal workers.
“We had an outstanding opening weekend, and it was great to see everyone enjoying the park,” Yellowstone Park Superintendent Cam Sholly said in an email Monday. “The plow crews are working hard to clear the remainder of the park’s roads from snow, and we are on schedule for our normal sequenced opening in the upcoming weeks, including the Beartooth Highway.”
After personally greeting the season’s first visitors at the West Entrance on Friday, Sholly reported the opening weekend drew 8,324 vehicles from there and the North Entrance at Mammoth, the only two entrances that have opened so far. That’s an increase of more than 11% from last year and put the weekend rush, unofficially Sholly said, at 21,642.
The staffing and opening weekend updates came as Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum put an oilfield executive in charge of “consolidation, unification and optimization of administrative functions” at the 70,000-person agency last week. Burgum, earlier this year, named Tyler Hassen as assistant secretary for policy, management and budget. Now Hassen will oversee Burgum’s consolidation order as the Trump administration’s DOGE plan to shrink the size of the federal government advances.
“If Doug Burgum doesn’t want this job, he should quit now.” Jennifer Rokala
Burgum’s appointment of Hassen and the consolidation order sparked worries in the conservation community, including at the Center for Western Priorities. The Denver-based nonpartisan conservation and advocacy organization accused the secretary of abdicating his responsibilities by not reserving any authority over firings or requiring any reporting by Hassen.
“If Doug Burgum doesn’t want this job, he should quit now,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director of Western Priorities. “Instead, it looks like Burgum plans to sit by the fire eating warm cookies while Elon Musk’s lackeys dismantle our national parks and public lands,” she said in a statement.
“Warm cookies” refers to a report in The Atlantic that Burgum’s chief of staff told political appointees to learn to bake cookies for their boss.
But potential visitors to the world’s first national park need not worry, said J. Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson at Burgum’s office.
“Visitors can expect the same great service they had in years past,” Peace wrote in an email Monday. “[I]n some National Parks, like at Yellowstone National Park, staffing numbers are higher than last year.”
Peace made her reassurances as regional business owners fret over the upcoming tourism season in Yellowstone, at neighboring Grand Teton and across Wyoming. Overseas traveler numbers to the U.S. dropped 11.6% in March after Trump tariffs, tariff threats, indiscriminate DOGE firings, resignations and economic turmoil battered expectations.

The order Burgum issued Thursday gives Hassen, now an assistant secretary, authority over the department’s Working Capital Fund, an office that in 2023 provided $119 million for department functions. Hassen will be able to rewrite manuals outlining employee responsibilities and may transfer funds, programs, records and property, according to the order.
Burgum’s order described his actions as furthering Trump’s February initiative for “implementing the president’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ workforce optimization.”
In addition to great service at national parks, Bureau of Land Management lands in Wyoming remain welcoming, Peace wrote. “Visitors to BLM-managed public lands can expect continued access and service across recreation sites, trails and campgrounds,” her email reads. “We are implementing necessary reforms to ensure fiscal responsibility, operational efficiency and government accountability.”
Burgum and DOGE’s “unification effort” will accelerate technology, enhance the mission to preserve parks and historic sites, serve Native American tribes and manage department holdings in Wyoming, Burgum’s order states. All told, the Department of the Interior manages 2.34 million acres of national park system lands, 18.4 million acres of BLM property and 70,000 acres of Fish and Wildlife Service reserves in the state. 
In Wyoming, Interior-managed land accounts for a third of the state’s area or about 21 million acres.
Hassen, a Deerfield Academy prep and Princeton grad, was CEO of Basin Energy, a Houston-based international oilfield services company, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he worked for Wenzel Downhole Tools, Basin Power, and served as chairman of the associate board of the nonprofit Cancer Research Institute in New York. He was an associate involved in global energy investment banking at Morgan Stanley in New York and London from 2005-2008, according to his profile.
He emerged on the DOGE scene after the Los Angeles fires in January when President Trump said California Gov. Gavin Newsom compounded the firefighting problem by not diverting water to southern California. Critics said DOGE conflated agricultural diversions, needs of the endangered Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary delta smelt and firefighting. 
Unqualified?
Western Priorities said DOGE efforts assign inexpert people to inappropriate positions.
“Since Elon Musk is now effectively in charge of America’s public lands, it’s up to Congress and the American people to stand up and demand oversight,” Rokala’s statement reads. “DOGE’s unelected bureaucrats in Washington have no idea how to staff a park, a wildlife refuge, or a campground. They have no idea how to manage a forest or prepare for fires in the wildland-urban interface. But Doug Burgum just gave DOGE free rein over all of that.”

""Many of us know at least one of the delegates. And we know they know better,"" one attorney said, after the delegation labeled a broad group of jurists ""biased.""
The post Barrasso, Lummis, Hageman deride concerned Wyoming jurists as ‘biased,’ ‘liberal’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Amid mounting concerns about White House disregard of court orders, Wyoming’s congressional delegates made clear last week that they continue to support President Donald Trump’s defiance of the federal judiciary.
And they are willing to insult their own constituents in defense of that position. 
Rep. Harriet Hageman and Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso publicly derided a distinguished swath of the Wyoming Bar while dismissing concerns those constituents raised in a March 26 letter warning that Trump and his allies’ threats could erode the country’s rule of law. 
Wyoming’s federal delegation lashed out at the letter’s signees the same week federal judges warned that the Trump administration was striking at the core of the constitutional system that protects Americans from an unruly or oppressive government. 
The more than 100 Wyoming jurists who put their name on the letter asking the delegation to protect the rule of law included three former state Supreme Court justices, an ex-governor, two former state attorneys general appointed by governors from both political parties, veteran attorneys and young Wyoming lawyers making their start in the profession. 
Among the names were those of Republican and Democrat politicians and the former law partner of Rep. Harriet Hageman’s husband. Though their leanings covered the political spectrum, they shared one thing in common: Mounting concern that the rule of law is under extreme duress. 
In response, Lummis, Hageman and Barrasso described the signatories as “biased, misguided” and “liberal,” in a press release issued last week. 
The delegation’s response came in two phases — the first was an April 11 letter rebuffing the Wyoming jurists’ concerns. Overreaching judges, not President Donald Trump’s threats, have placed the federal judiciary in the crosshairs, the delegation wrote.

That letter ended with an olive branch. “We look forward to working with each of you to secure a prosperous future for Wyoming and to ensure a return to the non-partisan rule of law,” the delegates wrote. 
On April 15, however, after WyoFile reporting made their letter public, the delegation dropped any niceties and issued a press release headlined: “Wyoming Delegation Responds to Biased, Misguided WY Judges and Lawyers.”
The delegate’s letter itself was “extremely dispiriting,” Jackson attorney Bill Schwartz, one of the letter’s signees, told WyoFile on April 17. But he had not yet seen the press release. 
“Well, that’s just preposterous,” he said, when a reporter described it to him. “These are very accomplished lawyers, from every part of the state, that went to the same law school as [Lummis and Hageman] did… Many of us know at least one of the delegates. And we know they know better.” 
The delegation’s answer has dismayed the letter signers, who saw in it deeply worrying signs for the country’s democratic rule. 
“We are, in my judgment, in very dangerous times,” Jackson attorney Bob Schuster wrote in an email to his fellow signees. “My concerns are only heightened by the cynical and unprincipled response from our Congressional delegation,” he added in the email obtained by WyoFile.
The three politicians, for their part, say they’re responding to “liberal former judges and lawyers attempting to publicly pressure the delegation into falsely condemning President Trump and allowing judges to continue blocking the agenda more than 70% of Wyoming residents support,” according to the press release.
In today’s Wyoming politics, “if you have an independent thought sometimes that makes you a liberal,” Gillette attorney Tom Lubnau said. As a Republican politician, Lubnau served in the Wyoming House from 2004 to 2014, rising to become Speaker of the House in his final term. 
“I’m going to take every opportunity I have to defend our court system and our constitutional system,” Lubnau told WyoFile. “Do I think the system is perfect? No. Do I think it’s the best system man has devised? Yes.” 
Lummis, Hageman and Barrasso did not respond to interview requests from WyoFile.

Lawyers and former judges who signed the letter say that even in the more restrained portion of the delegate’s response, the politicians misstated fundamental tenets of American law. Though disheartening, the delegation’s response has galvanized the letter’s signees to continue speaking up, and has led other Wyoming jurists to reach out and offer support, Schwartz said. 
The delegation issued its response during a week of ongoing clashes between the president and federal judges over the rights of migrants detained by the Trump administration and shipped to a prison in El Salvador. 
On Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. issued an order suggesting he could soon begin proceedings to hold the Trump administration in contempt of court. Trump had called for that judge, James Boasberg, to be impeached after Boasberg issued an injunction temporarily halting the president’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to detain people. 
Trump invoked the act to justify his administration’s imprisonment of Venezuelans and other Latin Americans in El Salvador, without court hearings. The act was last used during World War II, when it led to the infamous internment of Japanese-Americans, including at Heart Mountain in Wyoming. 
The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation has also called on the delegation to check Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act. “The misuse of the Alien Enemies Act at that time makes us particularly sensitive to any future abuse of the law,” the foundation wrote in an April 1 statement. 
The delegates did not respond to that message, though it was delivered to each of them, officials from Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation told WyoFile Monday. 
Concern over Trump’s suggestion that Boasberg should be impeached was central to the Wyoming jurists’ letter to the delegation. The signees called on Hageman, Barrasso and Lummis to speak against the idea that a judge could be personally targeted for a ruling the president didn’t like. Trump’s threat also drew a rare rebuke from U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.
The George W. Bush appointed chief justice said Trump was challenging two centuries of precedent, and that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” 
What’s at stake is far broader than the rights of those now imprisoned in El Salvador under Trump’s invocation of wartime powers, according to the signees of the letter to Wyoming’s delegation.
Schwartz, the Jackson attorney, and others pointed to a Thursday ruling and admonition penned by conservative, Ronald Reagan appointed judge Harvie Wilkinson, as an example of their concerns. 
“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” Wilkinson wrote. “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” 
“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” he continued. 
Lummis on Thursday labeled Boasberg’s injunction pausing the deportations to, and imprisonments in, El Salvador as “one of the most shocking examples” of judicial overreach during the Trump administration. 
“Boasberg ordered planes full of dangerous illegal aliens and alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to turn around mid-flight and return to the United States,” Lummis wrote in an opinion column published by Cowboy State Daily.

In the first three months of Trump’s presidency, judges have issued 15 nationwide injunctions on federal policies, Lummis wrote, one more than they did throughout the entirety of President Joe Biden’s term. “We must remember that judges are not policymakers – and they have not been elected by the American people to legislate. The people of Wyoming deserve a government where their elected representatives make the laws,” she wrote. 
Her fellow Wyoming Bar members say she’s being disingenuous at best. 
“You would think that any reasoned response to our letter might have paused to consider one of the first cases any of us read in our Constitutional Law course — Marbury v. Madison,” Schuster, the Jackson attorney, wrote in his email to colleagues. 
That 1803 case established that the courts can find that laws passed by Congress and executive actions are unconstitutional. The delegation, Schuster continued, is arguing that “the Court really did not mean what they said and that its 222 years of lasting precedent … is vaporous.”

(Tom Werner/Getty Images)As a family medicine physician in Boise and president and CEO of Full Circle Health, I have dedicated much of my career to enhancing medical education and addressing Idaho’s physician shortage. 
Serving as the Graduate Medical Education coordinator for the state, I authored Idaho’s 10-Year Graduate Medical Education plan to build a robust Graduate Medical Education system of residency programs throughout Idaho.  
Idaho faces a critical need for more medical doctors (MD’s and DO’s), especially in rural and underserved areas. House Bill 368, as amended, is a vital step toward addressing this shortage by expanding medical education opportunities within Idaho. The bill increases the number of medical school positions and establishes a working group to develop a comprehensive plan for Undergraduate Medical Education, or medical school training, in Idaho.
Comprehensive medical education includes both Undergraduate Medical Education and Graduate Medical Education. Think of it as a pipeline. 
Undergraduate Medical Education is the front end of the pipeline which lays the foundation — classroom learning and early clinical training. Graduate Medical Education serves as the backend of the pipeline and provides the advanced, hands-on clinical and hospital experience through residency programs, where medical school graduates train in the specialty of their choosing. 
Residency training is critical, as physicians must graduate from a residency program in order to become licensed practicing physicians. Data consistently shows physicians are more likely to stay and practice in the state where they complete their training. But to truly build a pipeline, Idaho must educate more doctors who not only stay here, but also open their doors to medical students for clinical rotations and their training in Idaho.
Investing in both Undergraduate Medical Education and Graduate Medical Education is essential to creating a full, self-sustaining medical education ecosystem and ensuring Idaho has the health care workforce it needs for the future. By supporting House Bill 368, we can strengthen our medical education infrastructure, attract and retain talented physicians, and ultimately improve health care access for all Idahoans.

Feds are ready to dump more of the cost for low-income Americans’ health insurance on states, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Gutting Medicaid to give tax breaks to the wealthy isn’t a smart choice, especially for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","Republicans have targeted Medicaid funding for decades and it appears the party’s leaders, axes anxiously in hand, finally have it on the chopping block.

Opinion

But the GOP doesn’t have to make huge cuts to a program that provides health insurance to 79 million low-income Americans. Even in a state as red as Wyoming, there should be pushback from voters, especially once people realize how much it will hurt access to health care for people of all ages and the risks it poses to rural hospitals and the economy.
U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, certainly doesn’t want her constituents to know how close Congress is to cutting Medicaid. In her March 2 “Wyoming Round-up” email, Hageman wrote such claims are “simply untrue” because a budget resolution she supported is just “a roadmap for future budget considerations and steps.” 
The resolution would extend provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy that are due to expire. The $880 billion in cuts over the next decade that Hageman and all but one House Republican voted for can only come from programs the House Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over. 
“The math is conclusive: Major cuts to Medicaid are the only way to meet the House’s budget resolution requirements,” according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.
However, there are many paths the House and Senate can take as they try to reach an agreement on ways to cut Medicaid so Trump can have what he’s called his “big beautiful bill” with tax cuts for the rich. Wyoming GOP lawmakers who fought Medicaid expansion tooth and nail over the past dozen years — and turned down about $1.4 billion in federal funds in the process — need to look at how much of Medicaid’s cost will be dumped into the state’s lap by their own party.
Wyoming and the federal government now split the cost of providing Medicaid for nearly 64,000 residents, 35% of whom are  children. About one-third of Wyoming births are paid by Medicaid, and the program pays for more than 70% of nursing home stays.
The Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a progressive think tank, says Wyoming is one of 10 states that would face a massive cost shift if Congress removed the current “floor” on the federal match rate of 50%. But even if the rate was reduced to 40% rather than being eliminated, Wyoming would see a cost shift of $58 million this year, a 13% increase in state Medicaid costs.
“Faced with increased cuts of this magnitude,” the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities warns, “Wyoming could cut people from Medicaid to reduce enrollment, roll back benefits considered optional under Medicaid — such as home- and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities — or shrink payment rates to health care providers.”
It’s not difficult to see Wyoming lawmakers making those choices, especially when the state is still losing mineral severance tax revenue and needs to spend more on education after losing a lawsuit for failing to properly fund public schools. But it won’t be popular, or easy to explain, when legislators go back home and get an earful from voters.
The vast majority of non-elderly adults enrolled in Medicaid either work or would likely qualify for work requirement exemptions due to having a disability, caring for family members, or attending school. But the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities says some Republicans are pushing to cut Medicaid by taking away coverage from people who do not meet a work requirement. 
In Wyoming, according to the organization, 13,000 people would be at risk of losing coverage under one version of this proposal.
Another idea to reduce Medicaid expenses is for the federal government to set a fixed per-person spending limit instead of covering a percentage of actual patient costs. This would shift financial risks to the states while saving an estimated $900 billion over 10 years.
In Wyoming, capping Medicaid costs could result in pregnant women, children, seniors and disabled people losing their benefits or coverage. Because of Wyoming’s aging population, the state would quickly exceed the funding cap.
The feds could also switch to a block grant approach, giving states fixed lump sums and leaving them responsible for covering any shortfalls.
Many rural hospitals are struggling, and nearly 200 have closed or significantly scaled back their services in the past 20 years. Rural hospitals have significantly lower operating margins than others and rely disproportionately on payments from Medicaid to remain in business. 
In Wyoming, Medicaid cuts could hit rural hospitals with a double whammy, thanks to the uncertainty about how the state’s new 25% property tax cut will impact the state’s 15 hospital districts that rely on such revenue. 
Wyoming has eight hospitals at risk of closing, according to a recent Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform report. Every one of Wyoming’s 19 “Critical Access Hospitals” — small, rural hospitals with 25 or fewer beds located at least 35 miles from another hospital — operated at a loss in 2023. Reducing tax revenues while simultaneously cutting Medicaid reimbursement rates will just increase the chances that rural Wyoming hospitals may close.
If there’s a silver lining, it’s that Medicaid is still a very popular program. A new survey by the University of Maryland found that Republican voters across the country, including in states like Wyoming that haven’t expanded Medicaid, widely support keeping or increasing federal spending on the program.
So, why is Congress about to spend the next several months locked in a bitter partisan battle over Medicaid cuts? Part of it is the untested notion that the GOP is so committed to preserving Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax overhaul from his first term — known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — that it’s a done deal.
It’s not. Consider this: The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis estimates that the top 0.1% of earners would get a tax cut of $314,000 under a full extension of the individual and estate tax provisions. The total cost of those tax cuts would amount to $4.2 trillion between 2026 and 2035.
Even gullible Americans who believe the rich will spend all of their tax savings to create jobs — instead of stock investments or stuffing it in offshore bank accounts — might think twice about giving the wealthy such huge tax breaks at the expense of vulnerable Medicaid recipients.
What happens when Americans realize that an $880 billion cut to Medicaid means their aging family members won’t be eligible for nursing home care?
The Economic Policy Institute says cutting Medicaid to pay for low taxes on the rich is a terrible trade. The institute notes Medicaid cuts that deprive children of access to health coverage could actually increase the federal budget in the long term because these children will not only be less healthy, they’ll grow up to earn less in wages, pay less in taxes and be more likely to receive other public benefits.
The Republicans’ margins in both the House and Senate are razor-thin. Last week, a group of 12 House Republicans sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, that stated, “We cannot and will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.”
It would only take peeling off a few GOP members in either chamber to change the dynamic of this entire Medicaid conversation. Once the tone shifts and public pressure builds to preserve Medicaid, maybe those tax breaks for the fat cats will stop being seen as a fait accompli, and their backers will be on the hot seat.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the final days of the 2025 legislative session, Tennessee officials are asking the U.S. Department of Education whether federal funds are being jeopardized by a bill that would restrict undocumented immigrant students from enrolling in K-12 schools.
The state’s Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic sent a letter Monday to U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to determine whether the state could lose $1.1 billion in federal funds if the legislature passes bills that could force school districts to check the citizenship status of children and force them to pay tuition to enroll.
Hoping for a quick turnaround, House Majority Leader William Lamberth told the Lookout Monday he requested the letter because he wants to know whether the money is at risk before the end of the session, which is expected to be Tuesday. 
The bill he is sponsoring, HB793, hit a roadblock, in part because of financial questions surrounding it and could be delayed until 2026, even though it passed the Senate. The Fiscal Review financial analysis says the funds could be in jeopardy because of federal laws prohibiting discrimination.
“We fully trust the Trump Administration will not withhold federal dollars from our schools due to the passage of House Bill 793/Senate Bill 836,” Lamberth said. “However, out of an abundance of caution, we want to be exceptionally careful before we move forward to ensure no federal taxpayer dollars are at risk. Our first obligation is to prioritize public dollars for students lawfully in the United States. The last thing we want to do is cause our schools to be further drained of much-needed resources.”
The House version of the legislation would give school districts the option to check students to determine whether they have permanent legal documentation, differing from the Senate version, which would require districts to check students’ immigration status and require tuition.
Stockard on the Stump: Tennessee immigrant student bill losing momentum

Federal Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origins in programs that receive federal funds, and violating the law could put the federal funds in danger. Those deal with the Every Student Succeeds Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, Carl Perkins Act and school nutrition.
Lamberth declined Monday to confirm that the bill could be dead for the year. The Lookout reported last week that the bill could be dead for the year, mainly because of financial questions.
Republican Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson, who has been feeling considerable pressure from opponents of the bill, said he would consider seeking a compromise on the measure, according to a Chattanooga TV report.
The bill is designed to go through the courts and challenge the 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe that required school districts to education students regardless of their immigration status.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)A bill slashing regulations for an estimated 80% of Tennessee’s non-federally protected wetlands is headed to Gov. Bill Lee’s desk Monday after receiving approval from the General Assembly.
The bill’s West Tennessee Republican sponsors — Rep. Kevin Vaughan and Sen. Brent Taylor — said the legislation removes onerous and seemingly subjective mitigation requirements for landowners and developers. 
Environmental advocates and scientists said the legislation paves the way for the destruction of Tennessee’s natural resources.
The bill passed 71-21 with one abstention in the House, and 25-6 in the Senate.
Since the 1970s, wetland regulations in Tennessee have required developers and landowners to seek permission from the state before draining or altering wetlands. The swampy areas can host diverse species, soak up rain water and filter it as it seeps into groundwater tables, recharging aquifers. Alterations to wetlands required developers to pay for mitigation — efforts to preserve or restore other wetlands nearby.










(Flooding) is a constant that we are dealing with, and these two things are related … and what (Sen. Brent Taylor) belittles as ‘damp dirt’ is actually the stuff that matters.


– Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville


Vaughan and Taylor’s legislation scraps automatic mitigation requirements for most of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands, which lack surface connections to navigable rivers and lakes. Federal law requires mitigation for those larger water bodies, but a 2023 Supreme Court ruling removed isolated wetlands from federal control, leaving their regulation entirely to the states.
Sen. Page Walley, a West Tennessee Republican who helped shape the legislation, said his district includes swampland. 
“That land over in that very agriculturally rich area is flat, it does flood, and it is replete with a variety of wonderful wetlands, but things change … and the state was given the authority to begin to monitor that,” Walley said Monday.
The Southern Environmental Law Center estimates the legislation will axe development regulations for up to 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands.


Recent modeling commissioned by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) indicates most of the state’s isolated wetlands are located in West Tennessee, a region expected to see intense development around Ford’s new Blue Oval City manufacturing campus in Haywood County. 
More than 30,000 acres of isolated wetlands fall in the northwest corner of the state, which remains inundated with historic levels of water after severe storms caused generational flooding earlier this month.
Nashville Democrat Jeff Yarbro grew up in Dyersburg, one of several West Tennessee towns that flooded. 
“(Flooding) is a constant that we are dealing with, and these two things are related … and what (Sen. Taylor) belittles as ‘damp dirt’ is actually the stuff that matters,” Yarbro said. “The research is pretty clear that it’s these smaller wetlands that … actually reduce the peak flooding levels in communities.”
The Senate rejected Sen. Heidi Campbell’s attempt to add a 2-year sunset provision to the law and an amendment that would have brought the law in line with the recommendations presented by TDEC in 2024.
New wetlands regulations
The sponsors initially planned to eliminate all state regulation of isolated wetlands to match federal law, citing other states’ decisions to do the same.
Wetlands protections built an industry for mitigation banking. Rollbacks could erode it.

Instead, the legislation defines four types of isolated wetlands and sets regulatory thresholds for each of them.
Artificial wetlands, a new category, are wetlands created purposefully or inadvertently by the alterations of humans or beavers. Developers are allowed to drain and fill this type of wetland with no regulatory oversight.
No permits or mitigation are required for alterations to low-quality isolated wetlands up to 1 acre, or moderate-quality wetlands up to one-quarter acre.
These wetlands have minimal or moderate roles in ecosystems, natural water cycles and chemical cycles, according to the legislation. Exact definitions for wetland quality will be created through a rule-making process that includes public input opportunities.
General permits and 1-1 mitigation are required for low-quality isolated wetlands from 1 to 2 acres in size. Changes to moderate-quality isolated wetlands from one-quarter acre to 2 acres require a general permit with mitigation capped at a 1-1 ratio (which raises to 2-1 on the second acre). 
Alterations to high-quality isolated wetlands will continue to require more specialized Aquatic Resource Alteration Permits from the state and mitigation, as will changes to low- and moderate-quality isolated wetlands larger than 2 acres.

About 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands are smaller than one acre, according to SELC Tennessee Director George Nolan. Around 94% of isolated wetlands are smaller than 2 acres.
​​The legislation also prevents TDEC from considering isolated wetlands of any quality when determining a project’s cumulative impact, even if the project encompasses other federally regulated wetlands.
The Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Home Builders of Tennessee supported the legislation, as did the Pacific Legal Foundation, a national firm that fought for deregulation of American wetlands at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023. They said the changes will support property rights and bring down costs for developers.
Several environmental groups, scientists and businesses that restore wetlands and sell mitigation credits to developers opposed the legislation, warning that the clause ignoring cumulative impact could super-charge wetlands destruction and hinder an industry that has invested more than $1 billion in restoration and conservation projects in Tennessee.
Vaughan said he sees mitigation requirements as “trampling people’s private property rights.”
“I may own a piece of property and because someone else says that there is something on my property that has resource value that I’m going to have to pay a third party to be able to use my own property. That does not compute,” Vaughan said Monday.
Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, voted against the bill. 
“If these changes are being made to improve our environment, are being made to improve the quality of life of people in Tennessee, that’s one thing,” Pearson said. “But if we are changing the protections of our natural resources on behalf of corporate entities to be able to make more profit, I have a significant problem with that.”

Fed up with unchecked pollution, environmental leaders of the 1970s organized, educated, and advocated, ultimately ushering in landmark federal regulations, such as the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, that fought contaminants in our air, water and land.
The environmental movement has excelled at standing up and saying “no,” with huge results. We can credit the rejection of pollution with helping to restore ecosystems and save countless lives. Today, while some things remain the same — and we’re still justified in fighting polluters to protect environmental and human health — some factors have changed, warranting new approaches. Climate change is no longer some far-off problem. It’s here, and it’s wreaking havoc. Last year was the warmest year on record; in fact, the hottest 10 years on record were all of the last 10 years. Floods, extreme storms, and disappearing winters are hurting Wisconsin’s communities and economy. And we need to do something about it. On this Earth Day, as we watch our federal government turn its back on the science of climate change, we have an opportunity to keep moving forward in Wisconsin by saying “yes” to wind and solar projects lining up for approval in our state.
While the president may be pushing expensive, “beautiful” coal and opening up protected lands for oil and gas drilling, we know that homegrown wind and solar are not only the cheapest ways to produce energy in Wisconsin, but they also bring enormous economic benefits to communities that host these projects. Farmers who sign leases to host solar panels or wind turbines receive high, stable income for 30 or more years. Communities hosting projects receive annual utility aid payments to the tune of $5,000 per megawatt. Local leaders can then direct this boost to municipal budgets where the community needs it most, like repairing roads and lowering taxes.
But let’s face it, in Wisconsin, large wind and solar projects remain controversial. Our state is rock bottom in the Midwest when it comes to the amount of wind energy we produce. Solar produces 100 times more energy per acre than ethanol, yet we devote more than a million acres of land to ethanol production and just a fraction of that to solar farms. The reality is that to protect the places we love and that sustain us, we need to build new, better infrastructure, because what we have now is harming us. We desperately need an alternative. We need more Wisconsinites to speak up in support of these solutions. The environmental movement cut its teeth by saying “no” to the problem of pollution. The time has come to build on this legacy and say “yes” to solutions: “yes” to clean energy, “yes” to thriving Wisconsin communities, and “yes” to a brighter future.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/solar-farm-photo-clean-wisconsin-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

The center has been studying the potential for rare earth mineral development in the state. (Kari Suedel/Energy and Environmental Research Center)Sen. Dale Patten says North Dakota is at the leading edge of rare earth mineral development in the United States and the Legislature is looking to keep it that way. 
Patten, R-Watford City, last week offered an amendment on House Bill 1459 that he said he hopes will keep North Dakota at the forefront of developing rare earth minerals, which are needed for products such as electronics and electric vehicles. 
China is filling most of the demand for rare earth minerals. But uncertainty over trade with China has increased the interest in developing rare earth minerals in the United States.
President Donald Trump in March issued an executive order to stimulate mineral production, including on federal lands controlled by the Department of the Interior.

Coal seams in North Dakota’s Williston Basin are a potential source, with Dan Laudal, a researcher at the School of Engineering and Mines at the University of North Dakota, telling a Senate committee last week the state could “piggyback” on existing coal mining to produce rare earth minerals. 
There was little discussion Monday as the Senate approved the amendment and the bill. It will now go back to the House, which had approved a very different version of the bill. 
Patten said last week that he hoped the House would not concur with the changes  the Senate approved Monday, which would push the bill into a conference committee for additional tweaks to improve the bill.
The House version proved to be contentious between groups representing landowners and lawmakers seeking to speed up extracting rare earth minerals by modifying existing coal leases. 
The amendment approved Monday removes references to coal leases from the bill. 
Patten said the new bill accomplishes three things:  

It establishes a policy to let the federal Department of Energy know that North Dakota wants to develop the resource. 
It clarifies that rare earth minerals are part of the mineral estate, as opposed to part of the surface land. 
It provides for a study of rare earth mineral development in the state. 

Troy Coons, chairman of the Northwest Landowners Association, testified against the previous version of the bill, saying the Legislature was interfering with what should be private contract negotiations between coal companies and landowners. He said the amended bill was better, but not perfect. 
“We’re not going to support it, but we’re not going to fight it,” Coons said Monday. 
He said the group would like to see the study include some guidance on how contracts with coal companies might be structured. He said he hopes the bill does not go into conference committee for fear that something gets changed in a way that will be detrimental to landowners. 
Several entities have been researching where rare earth mineral can be found in the state and the potential for development, including the Lignite Research Council, the Energy and Environmental Resource Center in Grand Forks, the North Dakota Geological Survey and UND.

Jonathan Fortner, interim president of the North Dakota Lignite Energy Council, said one of the goals of his group was to avoid spending a lot of time in court battling over leases. 
“This is probably one of the more complicated things we’ve tried to work on,” he said of potentially valuable mineral intermingled, but very sporadically within a coal vein. 
But he said it is a great opportunity for the coal industry to diversify away from just producing electricity. 
There are 17 rare earth minerals that could be separated from the coal and sent to other facilities for further refining and manufacturing, Laudal said. 
Laudal said Thursday a $100 million facility extracting rare earth minerals from about 200,000 tons of coal per year could be done profitably. That’s about 50 times the size of a UND pilot project. 
Rare earth minerals are found in their highest concentration at the top and bottom of coal seams, he said. A facility could extract and concentrate a mixture of rare earth minerals. 
Rare earth minerals are of potentially high value and shipping just a truckload a week could make the investment pay, he said. 
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

Fortner said with China’s dominance there is not an established market for domestic rare earth minerals, which may make it hard to attract investment. 
He said federal incentives or federal contracts, perhaps through the Department of Defense, could help provide some certainty and benefit coal companies and landowners. 
“Without more certainty, we won’t have extraction and landowners won’t benefit,” he said. 
Patten said having a domestic source of rare earth minerals is seen as a matter of national security and he is hopeful that the federal government could help offset the cost of development in North Dakota. 
“I would not be surprised that the Department of Energy says, ‘OK, because of a national security interest, we’re going to provide funding,’” Patten said.

Black maternal health advocates and researchers worry about federal funding cuts. (Courtesy of Birthlooms)Before everything went black, Tamika Jackson felt like she was drowning. While in labor giving birth to her baby boy, her body felt heavy and her breaths shallow.
“I can’t breathe,” she croaked to the anesthesiologist.
“If you couldn’t breathe, you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she recalled the doctor telling her, dismissing her as having a “panic attack.”
Minutes later, the 37-year-old’s lungs gave out. Her heart stopped beating.
Clinicians were able to resuscitate Jackson. Her baby boy was born via C-section, and the Michigan mom lived to tell her story of giving birth to Cree, who’s turning 3 next month.
Jackson is now a maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based nonprofit. She spoke with Stateline while on a bus to the Michigan Capitol, where she participated in a Black Maternal Health Week panel and pushed for a legislative package — nicknamed the Michigan Momnibus — which aims to increase obstetric patient protections and improve care for moms of color.
The Michigan Senate passed the package Thursday, and it now heads to the House.
Black moms like Jackson are three times more likely to die than white mothers and suffer higher rates of pregnancy-related complications.
But in its bid to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives, the Trump administration has terminated community health grants and closed federal offices that support state efforts to tackle racial health disparities. Experts say the moves will hinder efforts to improve Black maternal health.
“DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival,” Jackson said. “This is about community-based solutions — and they’re undoing that.”
Jackson added that without federal dollars, “We’re going to be left trying to do a whole lot with a whole lot of nothing.”
The Trump administration has cut grants for maternal health studies and research on health disparities in various populations, including patients of color and LGBTQ people. It has laid off most staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, and removed maternal health data from federal agency websites.
It also is considering cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion, according to The New York Times. The administration plans to create a new Administration for a Healthy America, which would focus on maternal and child health, among other issues.
HHS and its National Institutes of Health did not return requests for comment in time for publication.











DEI is not about politics. It’s about survival.


– Tamika Jackson, Michigan mom and maternal health organizer at Mothering Justice



Researchers and advocates like Jackson say that amid the Trump administration’s erasures, their work will continue.
Among those losing grants are nonprofits, health care systems and universities, including the Morehouse School of Medicine, a historically Black medical school in Atlanta, which received a $2.96 million grant for a center to improve the health of Black pregnant and postpartum women. Georgia has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.
“We are reviewing the situation to assess how it may affect our research,” a Morehouse spokesperson wrote in an email. “More broadly, it is important that we all recognize the critical role medical research plays in developing potential life-saving innovation that will mitigate disease and improve the health and well-being of many people.”

The Morehouse center was selected among an initial 10 research centers funded under the NIH’s Maternal health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone, or “IMPROVE,” Initiative.
Columbia University and community groups throughout New York also received the grants. One goal was to connect postpartum moms with doulas to detect conditions such as postpartum preeclampsia, according to principal investigator Dr. Uma Reddy, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia. Reddy said the grant was developed with communities who voiced their needs.
“We can actually prevent these deaths and these serious complications,” Reddy said. “This is a way to focus on a high-risk population and provide them with the resources that they don’t have available.”
Tufts University maternal health scholar Ndidiamaka Amutah-Onukagha said she’s had several meetings in Washington, D.C., get canceled, and while she’s thankful to have almost completed one federal grant project, there’s uncertainty about other grants she’s applied for, including a Black postpartum support research initiative.
The professor runs the Maternal Outcomes for Translational Health Equity Research (MOTHER) Lab and Center for Black Maternal Health and Reproductive Justice at the Tufts University School of Medicine.
“It not only stalls progress, but it actually actively endangers the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “These policy decisions can cause and will cause lasting harm to people who are already underserved by our health care system.”
Amutah-Onukagha said she is urging researchers and advocates to have “cautious optimism.”
“Most people are in the space of gloom and doom. I do get that, and I’m vastly in and out of that,” she said. “But because of the work that I do in maternal health, we have to remain optimistic. That lens cannot die. If it does, then the communities that we serve are going to be even more disadvantaged.”
Amutah-Onukagha, who recently testified before the Massachusetts Joint Committee on Public Health, said her team will continue to work with organizations around the state, such as Birth Equity & Justice Massachusetts and Resilient Sisterhood Project.
“We’re stronger in numbers,” she said.
Diana Greene Foster, research director in reproductive health at the University of California, San Francisco, conducted the seminal Turnaway Study documenting the harms women suffer from abortion denials.
She was in the middle of another study, funded by a federal grant, tracking post-Roe abortions and the efficacy of health exceptions in abortion ban laws. Her team was interviewing emergency room doctors about whether they could provide abortions amid major pregnancy complications such as eclampsia, a serious consequence of preeclampsia, which is a dangerous form of high blood pressure that disproportionately affects Black mothers.
The administration pulled her grant.
Foster, who is fundraising to continue her study, said she feels the administration’s actions send a message of “turning their back on science, on compassion, on caring about women.”
Tina Sherman, a doula and national director of maternal justice at MomsRising, a nonpartisan women and mothers advocacy group, said she worries about data the administration has removed, including the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.
The surveillance system is a comprehensive tool states use to track maternal health and formulate policies to improve it.
“An attempt to erase the data,” said Sherman, “doesn’t erase the harm that has been done and creates additional harm.”
Without data, states can’t target where resources are needed and which communities are disproportionately harmed and how, said Sherman, who co-chairs the North Carolina Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
“We’re going to be going backwards,” she said.
The Trump administration also canceled several grants focused on intimate partner violence, a leading cause of pregnancy-associated death which disproportionately affects people of color.
One such grant was supporting a University of North Carolina project studying intimate partner violence against pregnant women shortly before they give birth.
“The issues remain. The urgency is pressing as it ever was. The reality is this: Black mothers and birthing people continue to carry the weight of a crisis that we did not create,” Amutah-Onukagha said. “We did not create it, but we are leading the fight to solve it and dismantle it, and we know that the systemic barriers existed before this administration.
They will continue to show up — but we will also continue to produce cutting-edge research here at the center.”

Of 15 pharmacies the Advocate contacted for this article, all but two kept naloxone behind the counter. Pharmacists and business owners said requests for the drug have been low or nonexistent among their clientele, and they haven’t thought of moving it to a different area. Others cited shoplifting and the drug’s expense as a concern; several said more insurance providers should cover the cost.
Goodman Drug in Corning, a town of about 3,000 people in Clay County, was one of two pharmacies that makes naloxone available over the counter. Though owner Cathy Goodman said she didn’t have many customers come in looking for the product, she said it was important to keep it in an accessible location.
“Some people have prescription drugs and children in the house,” Goodman said. “[Naloxone] may not necessarily be for them, but it should be readily available to anybody who has anything [with opioids] in their household,” she said.
More than 82,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in 2024, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The same data shows Arkansas had 386 drug overdose deaths in 2024, though the figure could change as the data is finalized. The CDC reported a 28% decrease in Arkansas overdose deaths from 2023 to 2024.
Naloxone is packaged as many brands, and the Narcan nasal spray was a commonly known label when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its availability in March 2023. While the nasal spray is effective and designed for easy use, experts say 911 should still be called immediately in the event of an overdose.
Arkansas officials stress the importance of naloxone distribution as they gradually allocate the state’s $216 million share of the national $26 billion opioid settlement funds. The funds were divided between the state, counties and cities. The Arkansas Association of Counties and the Arkansas Municipal League pooled their allocations together and formed the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership, which former state drug director Kirk Lane leads.
“I think there’s a stigma attached to anything that has to do with substance use disorder, and there always has been,” Lane said, acknowledging that naloxone carries a stigma. “It’s what’s always made it difficult for us to give resources to people who need it.”

Lane agreed that keeping naloxone behind the counter where a customer has to ask for it establishes a barrier. However, ARORP has distributed about 100,000 dosage units of naloxone statewide, and Lane said if someone has a will to access the medicine, they could get it very quickly from a local participating organization, law enforcement agency or emergency services group.
Lane said the recovery partnership has approved funding for a handful of pharmacies to provide naloxone kits free of charge to patients who can’t afford it.
Per Arkansas Act 651 of 2021, health care professionals are required to prescribe an opioid antagonist like naloxone under certain conditions, including when a patient has a history of opioid use disorder or if they receive an opioid dosage of at least 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day for at least five days.

Patient hurdles
Spence Reed, an owner of the ReedHutchins Pharmacy in Heber Springs, said he could see how the behind-the-counter placement of naloxone in his Cleburne County store would create an additional hurdle for customers. But Reed said he’s also concerned that people might steal the $60 medicine. He compared the product to pregnancy tests or condoms, which he said are commonly taken to avoid embarrassment.
Several other pharmacy operators said they were worried naloxone would be taken unknowingly out of their business and have kept it behind the counter so they can keep an eye on it.
Chris Cooper, director of operations for Heartland Pharmacy’s 11 Arkansas locations, said the location of the drug depends on the storefront. While smaller businesses with less to oversee may stock it on their shelves, it’s mostly kept behind the counter as a preventative for shoplifting.

“It’s not cheap, so contrary to what a lot of people think — they think that it is still very affordable, a cheap medication that they can just snag. Unfortunately, it’s not,” he said.
Cooper said the behind-the-counter placement is not meant to deter use of the drug in any way, and he expressed support for naloxone access as drug overdose continues to affect thousands nationwide each year.
Naloxone is typically packaged in a small box containing two nasal sprays. Most Arkansas pharmacies sold the product for about $65, though Eudora Drug Store’s pharmacist Clara Rice said the price was up to $250.
Eudora is a town of about 2,000 people in the Arkansas Delta, not far from the Mississippi River. Data shows the town’s median age is 52, and an average household income is about $27,000. Rice described the area as having high crime.
“We don’t want to take any chances with having [naloxone] out front,” Rice said. “Of course, if there were an emergency, it would be easy to get to if that was the case.”
Such is the notion that many rural pharmacies described: If a customer came in and asked for naloxone, they would still be able to buy it.
“It’s a financial thing for me,” said Tyler Staten, manager of Gannaway Drug in Warren, the seat of south Arkansas’ Bradley County. “If nobody’s demanding it — then just like stocking anything else, if you don’t have a demand for it there’s no need to stock it on the shelf. As soon as somebody wants it or needs it, I’m willing to do that. We will do that.”
While theft may play a small factor in Larry Thomerson’s decision to keep the medicine behind the counter at the Gurdon Pharmacy in Arkansas’ south central Clark County, he also wants to talk with his customers beforehand and ensure they know how to use it, he said.
Thomerson, a pharmacist of 50 years, said he doesn’t consider naloxone to carry a stigma, and there are no restrictions on buying naloxone in his shop. “I’ll be glad to sell it to anyone who wants one,” he said.
Cissy Clark, pharmacist and owner of Clarks Family Pharmacy in Earle, also pushed back on the idea that purchasing naloxone is complicated by stigma.
“I live in a really, super small town. I’ve known these people since 1995; raised them from diapers,” Clark said. “I think they’re comfortable enough with me to come in and ask for it.”
She also said that she recommends naloxone to customers who are headed off to college soon in case of any emergencies. 
Earle is located in Crittenden County on the Arkansas-Mississippi border. In 2020, the town had a population of about 1,800. The town takes up about 3.25 square miles, and staff said Clarks Family Pharmacy is the only local provider in town.
Still, Clark said she keeps naloxone behind the counter because of the area’s financial standing.
Financial burden
In Heber Springs, Reed said not many people have asked for naloxone over the counter, but it is included with frequent pain medicine prescriptions. He said that if a medicine could save a life and prescribers have to include it on their opioid scripts, insurances should cover it.
“We often try to tell them it could be somebody who doesn’t know what it is that gets a hold of [pain pills] in your house — could be another family member or grandchild — somebody that accidentally gets a hold of them and takes them,” Reed said. “That way, you would have [naloxone] on hand to hopefully rescue them or prevent an unwanted outcome.”
Mayflower Family Pharmacy owner Michael Thilo tells his Faulkner County customers something similar. Rather than highlight how a customer’s dependency on pain medicine is a physical addiction itself, Thilo said he puts a “soft spin” on naloxone to encourage people to keep the overdose-reversal medicine around.
  Michael Thilo, owner, Mayflower Family Pharmacy (Source: mayflowerfamilypharmacy.com)
Thilo said he prompts his clientele to think about what would happen if a child accidentally consumed the pills, which shifts the focus away from the person using the pain medicine.
“I definitely think there’s a stigma,” Thilo said. “I think most people see it as, ‘I don’t need that because I don’t have that problem,’ whether they realize they do have the problem or not. I think most people that have been on opioids long term just need it for day-to-day, but they don’t realize they’re addicted to it.”
Thilo said he hasn’t had anyone ask for naloxone over the counter, and affordability may be another barrier.
Of the most common insurance providers — including Medicare for whom Thilo considers the most vulnerable population — about half won’t cover the medicine, he said. He estimated that one customer out of every 10 who receive an opioid prescription at his pharmacy will pick up naloxone because of the copay expense.
“I think all insurances should be required to cover it for no cost,” Thilo said. “If we’re worried about it as a population, as a society, then I think we should take it seriously and remove the financial burden.”
Heath Branscrum, a pharmacist and part owner of Health-Wise Pharmacy in the small Washington County town of Lavaca, shared similar sentiments about his patients not jumping to pay the cost of the preventative medicine.
“One of the barriers to people gaining access to Narcan is the fact that their insurance is not covering, particularly Medicare-affiliated insurances, the over-the-counter version of Narcan,” Branscrum said. “…There’s a large number of people out there that are supposed to have Narcan available to them, but they don’t get it because it’s going to cost them $50.”
Other resources
Purchasing naloxone at a pharmacy isn’t the only way residents living in rural Arkansas can access resources to stop the opioid epidemic. 
River Valley Medical Wellness, a primary care provider with offices in Russellville and Hot Springs, in 2023 launched the Arkansas Mobile Opioid Recovery (ARMOR) nonprofit, which sends mobile health units with critical substance use care to rural pockets in the state.
Attorney General Tim Griffin funded the first mobile health unit with a $777,000 grant from the state’s opioid settlement funds. After seeing some success, the Arkansas Department of Human Services provided the same funding amount for a second mobile unit. Tucker Martin, chief operating officer at River Valley Medical Wellness and co-founder of ARMOR, said the goal is to have five mobile health units that provide services in each corner of the state and in the Little Rock metro area.
According to results from a twice yearly River Valley Medical Wellness social determinants of health survey, Martin said patients consistently list transportation to care at the top of the list.

“They’re making a decision about whether they’re going to buy food to put on the table for their family, or they’re going to put gas in their car, travel 38 miles or whatever it is, to go to the doctor,” Martin said. “That’s the kind of decision that these people are facing, so that birthed the idea of, ‘Let’s create an environment where we can take health care directly to communities.’”
April 14 marked the one-year anniversary of ARMOR’s mobile health unit launch, and Tucker said 1,785 patients in a handful of towns were treated during that time. Each of the meetings are “very meticulously scheduled” and coincide with a providing service already in the community, such as a local church, he said.
More than 1,200 free naloxone kits were distributed to the community in the last year, according to an impact report from ARMOR.
“My deep, deep desire is to give the same thing that was given to me, which is access to a little bit of hope,” said Martin, who celebrated nine years of continuous sobriety in October. 
At the state level, Griffin also has distributed a portion of opioid settlement funds to a variety of organizations focused on providing help to those with opioid addiction. Griffin recently launched a pilot program for the state’s specialty courts system and helped fund opioid research at Arkansas Children’s Hospital.
The Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership funds projects in all 75 counties that aim to abate the opioid epidemic. While Lane said ARORP doesn’t allow applications for naloxone kits from individuals, the organization works to provide funding for local entities that can distribute the resource in the community.
ARORP’s Naloxone Hero Project distributed more than 100,000 dosage units statewide, the majority of which went to local organizations. Recently, ARORP started distributing units to law enforcement agencies, first responders and fire departments.
The ReviveAR mobile app also teaches residents how to use naloxone, where they can access it locally and how to provide support for family and friends. The app provides step-by-step opioid reversal instructions in English, Spanish and Marshallese.
“I think in every ability where there’s any possibility of somebody overdosing … [naloxone] ought to be considered as a resource to reverse an overdose,” Lane said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Tennessee Attorney General’s Office could soon have the responsibility for investigating claims of discrimination by state agencies after the state Senate passed a measure dissolving the Human Rights Commission and moving operations to the AG’s office. 
Senate Bill 861, sponsored by Huntingdon Republican Sen. John Stevens, passed Monday 27-6 on partisan lines. The House version, sponsored by Goodletsville Republican Rep. Johnny Garrett, passed Thursday. The bill would go next to the governor’s desk for his signature.
The 60-year-old commission is a nonpartisan and independent agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in employment, housing and public accommodation as well as discrimination claims against the state of Tennessee.  
Bill to give Tennessee AG civil rights oversight draws Democratic pushback over partisanship

The measure has drawn criticism from Democrats who say handing discrimination claims to Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti sets up a “fox in the henhouse” scenario. 
After Stevens referred to Skrmetti’s office as “the most nonpartisan” of Tennessee’s three branches of government, Sen. Raumesh Akbari, a Memphis Democrat, disagreed. 
“I’m not going to make it personal, but if you’ve never been discriminated against . . . it makes a difference who is investigating,” Akbari said. “I would urge you to google the last few suits the attorney general has filed and I assure you their actions do not look nonpartisan.”
Skrmetti has led or joined lawsuits that include a challenge to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s rule prohibiting discrimination against women seeking abortions, litigation seeking to stop transgender medical care for minors and sent letters to corporations warning them against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, among other actions.
Tennessee Attorney General’s Office to election finance office: We’re “not an investigative agency”

Stevens said his review of the commission showed that thousands of claims have “languished” and not been investigated.
Democrats objected to that characterization.
“HRC testified to the fact they have several vacancies on their commission and it’s because the House Speaker has refused the fill the vacancies since 2022,” said Sen. Charlane Oliver, a Nashville Democrat.
“We have crippled the ability of the HRC to do their job,” she said. “That may be the reason they can’t respond to complaints.” 
Sen. Kerry Roberts, a Springfield Republican, described the commission as “enormously ineffective” before calling for a vote.
Under the measure, the commission will be dissolved by July 1 and its 30 staff positions will move to the attorney general’s office.

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
 ‘Dots don’t quite connect’

Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”













I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity





In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
 Long-term trend

The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s poor and rural districts stand to lose the most from a budget with no earmarks, some legislators said, while others celebrated a pause on spending long criticized for its lack of transparency.
When the Senate Finance Committee advanced its spending plan for the coming fiscal year, Chairman Harvey Peeler made a stunning announcement: The budget will not include any earmarks — in other words, no spending requested by legislators to fund projects in their districts.
The decision comes two years after total earmarks — what legislators have consistently called “community investments” — soared to $713 million. While last year’s tally was smaller, at $435 million, critics said the process still allowed unvetted spending of taxpayer dollars.
Churches, charities with little track record among nonprofits in line for $90M in SC budget

Peeler, the Senate’s chief budget writer since 2022, made clear the tally this year will be zero.
“No more pet projects equals more money in your pockets,” the Gaffney Republican said in a statement April 9.
Two hours later, a joint statement went out from Peeler and House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister agreeing to focus this year on “tax reform.” (Typically, the House adds earmarks after the Senate passes its budget plan.)
Exactly what that means remains to be seen.
The House Ways and Means Committee meets Tuesday to take “expert testimony” on options for changing the tax structure. The meeting comes three weeks after a fiscal analysis showed a House GOP proposal would result in most tax filers paying more in state income taxes initially, resulting in Republicans putting the skids on their own bill.
The agenda clearly states, in bold and underlined, the committee will take “no vote” Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the full Senate will open floor debate Tuesday on its spending package. It includes a revenue reduction of $290.5 million to complete the Legislature’s 2022 tax-cutting law, which phased in a reduction in income tax rates, a year ahead of schedule. The budget passed by the House in March planned to do at least that.
Legislators’ response to no earmarks
Peeler’s announcement surprised even legislators, including many who had already submitted the paperwork laying out their earmark requests. Poor, rural communities in particular will have to forgo improvements and new equipment they can’t afford without help, legislators representing those areas said.
That includes projects already underway that local governments need funding to complete, said House Assistant Minority Leader Roger Kirby.
“It is not conservative to waste money on restarting projects, and that’s what we’re going to have to do,” the Lake City Democrat said.
In Williamsburg County, one of the poorest in the state, Kirby had asked for money to expand the water system, with the hopes of attracting bigger businesses to the area.
Williamsburg County doesn’t have the tax revenue to afford finishing the project. But without the expansion, the county won’t be able to attract more economic development, Kirby said.
SC lawmakers set to spend over $430 million on local projects

That project and similar ones “are not going to happen on their own,” Kirby said. “They’re just not.”
Rural water system improvements were also among requests made by freshman Sen. Russell Ott.
Ott asked for new water meters in Swansea, as well as improvements to water and sewer systems in Calhoun County and the stormwater system in Cayce. Those systems are in dire need of upgrades that the cities and counties can’t afford, he said.
“Folks from my district need help, real help,” said the St. Matthews Democrat, who was the House’s assistant minority leader before Kirby.
Without extra money, cities in Marlboro County will continue driving firetrucks from the 1980s, said Sen. JD Chaplin, a Darlington Republican. The sheriff’s department in Lee County will remain unable to fix its broken air conditioning unit. And law enforcement officers across the five counties Chaplin represents will continue using unreliable radios, he said.
Chaplin, a freshman legislator, said he was disappointed to learn he wouldn’t get to fund those projects. When he was running for office, he promised to better fund law enforcement and infrastructure in his area, which those earmarks could have done, he said.
“It’s going to continue another year with patches and Band-Aids and not actually fixing the problems we have in South Carolina,” Chaplin said.
That’s not to say Chaplin opposes a tax cut, which was another of his campaign platforms, he added.
Chaplin and Ott, who also said he’d support a tax cut, questioned why legislators couldn’t figure out a way to do both.
Relying on state money that may or may not come through on a given year has always been a bad idea, said Sen. Greg Hembree. Each year, the Little River Republican suggests to representatives of the local governments and nonprofits that come to him for funding to think of whatever they get as a gift: nice to have but not necessary to keep running, he said.
Depending on earmarks is “a risky place to live,” he said.
Last year, at Hembree’s request, North Myrtle Beach received $1.5 million to dredge sediment and debris from Cherry Grove Beach, and Sea Haven Youth Crisis Center got $65,000 to screen youth for medical and dental issues, according to budget documents.
While Hembree would have liked to continue funding those causes this year, they won’t end without it, he said.
“Nobody’s closing their doors because the money isn’t coming in,” Hembree said.
Although earmarks are one-time spending, legislators have long used repeated requests to fund expensive projects in their districts or give annual allocations to nonprofits, amounting in some cases to millions of dollars over the course of several years.
Spending on earmarks ballooned after the COVID-19 pandemic, when the state’s budget was flush with federal assistance and sales tax collections spiked as South Carolinians spent their own federal relief payments. The budget passed in 2022 contained about $390 million in earmarks, after the Legislature upheld Gov. Henry McMaster’s vetoes that struck $33 million worth, before hitting a record high $713 million in 2023.
After such high amounts, taking a year off could help legislators take a step back and consider how they’re spending that money, Hembree said.
“It’ll be kind of healthy,” Hembree said.
Past and future budgets
If the budget continues without earmarks in coming years, Hembree said he feared a return to secretive spending slipped into the budget with little-to-no oversight. For years, earmark spending was rolled together in vaguely worded line items in agencies’ budgets that gave no clue as to where the money was going.
That practice ended in 2021, when legislators began listing earmarks and who sponsored them. In 2023, for the first time, legislators began giving the governor’s office paperwork explaining their requests before sending him their final spending plan.
But eliminating earmarks won’t eliminate requests for money, and the pressure will be on for legislators to fulfill them somehow, Hembree said.
“I fear (the process) could revert back to what it was,” Hembree said.
Legislators might consider creating a grant program, as McMaster has advocated for years. Under his proposal, local governments and nonprofits could apply for a chunk of money for agencies to dole out.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey celebrated even a brief end to a process he has criticized for years over a lack of transparency.
“Hallelujah,” said the Edgefield Republican, who was part of a bipartisan duo that successfully pushed for the secrecy to end.
Even after the changes in recent years, Massey has questioned the process and called for reviews on the back end, to be sure nonprofits were spending the money the way they said they would.
“Ultimately, I think we have to make a decision,” Massey said. “Should we collect more money than we need and then dole it out in this process that really has little vetting? Or should we just not take any more money from taxpayers than we need?”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5092-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

(Courtesy of EcoFlight)Last month, Lee Zeldin, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced a plan to revoke the 2009 greenhouse gas endangerment finding, the key scientific determination that allows the EPA to regulate climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.
One of the basic functions of good government is to provide reliable information that can then inform policy that is in the public interest. At a time when the federal government is subverting basic truths about climate impacts, it is imperative that local- and state-level policymakers highlight dangers to people and the planet.
Colorado House Bill 25-1277, “Increasing Transparency Impact of Fuel Products,” seeks to achieve this goal by requiring fossil fuel retailers to place a warning label on gas pumps and in other locations where fossil fuels are sold.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If passed, HB-1277 would require retailers to affix a warning sticker with the following text:

WARNING: Use of this product releases air pollutants and greenhouse gases, known by the state of Colorado to be linked to significant health impacts and global heating, respectively, pursuant to section 25-5-1603, C.R.S. Tampering with this label is a violation of section 18-4-510, C.R.S.

In light of a multi-front assault on science in general and on climate data in particular, policies that inform the public about basic health and safety measures — think tobacco and alcohol warnings — are an important intervention. Furthermore, the legislation will not cost taxpayers money and represents a relatively small burden on retailers, who will have a 45-day opportunity to correct missing or illegible labels before any enforcement actions are begun.
The stakes could not be higher. A 2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that in order to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the level required to avoid the worst outcomes, we would need to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. Even limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius requires 25% emissions reductions by 2030 and 100% by 2075.
Every additional fraction of a degree of heating exponentially increases risk to a stable climate and to the social and biological systems upon which we all rely. Here in Colorado, oil and gas production along with transportation are the top two sources of ozone pollution. Ozone is particularly dangerous for children and is linked to a range of health problems including asthma, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.
Sadly, instead of playing a leading role in coordination efforts across sectors and borders that might give us a fighting chance to avoid climate catastrophe, the current federal administration is leading a fossil fuel cult devoted to short-term profit at the expense of a livable future. This involves denying basic truths about how fossil fuels harm our health and planet. The warnings required by HB-1277 can serve as a state-level counterbalance to this disinformation campaign.
My parents grew up at a time when clouds of smog hung over our cities and our rivers were flammable. I grew up at a time when public places were filled with cigarette smoke and there was a dangerous hole in the ozone layer. These hard-fought public health success stories demonstrate that science-based interventions that improve our health and wellness are possible.
No amount of governmental obfuscation can undo the inconvenient truth that climate impacts are here and now. At a time when climate progress and public health are at risk, states and municipalities must step into the breach to keep the public informed.

But 15 years of budget cutting have left the state far from prosperous. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Several important policy priorities have defined conservative Republican governance of North Carolina during the last 15 years – the culture wars, the effort to make elections more partisan and voting more difficult, the explosion of private school vouchers. But if there is a single phenomenon that has stood out above all others, it has been the relentless crusade to defund core public structures and services.
Thanks to an ongoing series of regressive tax cuts, the falloff in what North Carolina invests in state government as a share of total state income – by far the best indicator of overall capacity and effort – has been precipitous. In 2024, for instance, the state General Fund budget was around 21% lower by this measure than it was in 2009. In previous years, the gap exceeded 30%. All told, North Carolina has disinvested in government to the tune of tens of billions of dollars over past decade-and-a-half.
For those who might still harbor any doubts as to why so many of a fast-growing state’s public school classrooms, DMV offices and correctional and mental health facilities lack adequate numbers of fully trained and qualified personnel, look no further than these dollar figures, and the low employee pay and poor benefits to which they have given rise.
Weirdly, however, despite the obvious cause-and-effect nature of this situation, conservative politicians have clung to a strange brand of denial over the years that, in turn, has helped spur a kind of vicious downward cycle.
Here’s how it has worked:
When GOP lawmakers assumed control of the General Assembly in 2011, the watchword was attacking “government bureaucracy.” Spurred on by people like national right-wing activist Grover Norquist, who infamously and gruesomely bragged that his mission was to shrink government down to the size “where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub,” conservative pols made attacking state employment in Raleigh a top priority.
Department of Public Instruction employees – the people charged with the unenviable task of monitoring and assisting 115 school districts as they employed tens of thousands of educators and educated over a million children – were regularly dismissed as useless functionaries, authors of burdensome “unfunded mandates,” and inhabitants of the “pink palace” (a derisive reference to the Department of Public Instruction office building that was located just north of the Legislative Building).
And so it was that the General Assembly enacted big tax and spending cuts in response – some over the objection of Democratic governors, and for four years, with the aid of a Republican chief executive.
The result, unsurprisingly, was that core services like schools, mental health, transportation, public safety, and environmental permitting – plagued by funding cuts and staff reductions — all struggled mightily to keep up with rising demands of what remained a fast-growing population.
And it wasn’t long before the falloff in services produced scads of constituent complaints. Frustrated by things like teacher shortages, massive waits from services for people with developmental disabilities and basics as simple as driver’s license renewals and construction permits, North Carolinians spoke out and made their unhappiness known. It continues to this day.
Here, however, is the wrinkle that’s especially maddening.
Rather than responding to the complaints about inadequate services by restoring funding and at least placing a hold on more tax cuts, the same politicians who imposed the big cuts initially joined the chorus of complaints. Instead of acknowledging how their policies had demoralized and overwhelmed the state employees who remained, GOP lawmakers decried the decline in services, made a regular show of interrogating agency heads, and advanced two new solutions: privatizing public services and lowering standards
Indeed, both of these “solutions” are being advanced this year as GOP lawmakers promote ideas like increasing caps on public school class sizes, privatizing DMV services, allowing driver’s licenses to be renewed less frequently, doing away with environmental reviews of new developments near waterways, and lowering building code standards — ostensibly to promote Hurricane Helene recovery.
And, of course, the final step in this whole destructive cycle comes when, claiming to be motivated to improve quote “efficiency,” the same politicians advance legislation to start the whole process over again by pursuing still more tax cuts and threatening more state agency job cuts. See, for instance, the new state Senate budget proposal and the so-called DAVE Act bill that would empower state Auditor Dave Boliek to act as a kind mini-Elon Musk.
Taken together, it’s enough to make a body think that Norquist’s morbid fantasy may just have been the plan all along.
The bottom line: slashing funding for basic public services for the purpose of improving outcomes makes no more sense that draining blood from an anemic patient or forgoing the basic upkeep of one’s car or home. And right now, it’s long past time for our state to break this vicious and destructive cycle.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Seal-in-Senate-Chambers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-22 06:05:35.308034

(Courtesy of the Virginia Department of Transportation)Certain Virginia bridges and tunnels could be repaired or replaced ahead of schedule, saving citizens years of waiting to use the structures, thanks to a law that will take effect this summer that stems from a bipartisan effort in this year’s General Assembly approved by the governor.
Lawmakers and Gov. Glenn Youngkin passed an administrative proposal allowing the state to expedite projects considered under Virginia’s Special Structures Program by issuing revenue bonds up to $200 million a year, and up to $1 billion total. Issuance will begin in 2028.
The Commonwealth Special Structures Program stems from a 2020 measure that allocates $80 million annually to cover “special structures,” identified by the Commissioner of Highways and approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) as very “large, indispensable, and unique bridges and tunnels.”
Virginia Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller said at an April 15 CTB meeting that bonding the program funds can help projects move much faster.
“This is a great financial decision for the commonwealth,” Miller said. “Not only do we get to use cheaper money as opposed to more expensive money, but we also get the benefits of all these programs many, many years earlier.”
Ahead of the last General Assembly session, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) asked lawmakers to consider the bill, framing it as a way to help avoid future inflationary costs on the state’s structure improvements and replacements. 
According to the agency, VDOT has experienced 24% in cost escalation over the last three fiscal years in its construction program.
Laura Farmer, chief financial officer for VDOT, said in a recent April 15 presentation to the Commonwealth Transportation Board that “though the current funding revenue stream for special structures is reliable, it is not sufficient to set aside money over many years to take care of replacement projects.”
Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, carried the successful legislation, which Youngkin signed March 21. It will take effect July 1.
 Norris Bridge and more to come

With VDOT’s ability to bond funds in the special structures program, the agency has already moved forward with its planning to replace the Robert O. Norris Bridge, which connects the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula, eight years ahead of schedule.
The 1.9-mile, 67-year-old bridge is located over the Rappahannock River, between Lancaster and Middlesex counties. If the bridge were closed for any reason, an average of 7,560 vehicles would have to take a detour route totaling 85 miles.
The agency said the vertical clearance in the channel span for marine traffic is 110 feet. 
According to the governor’s office, the new bridge will have “substantially” wider travel lanes, fully functional shoulders and significantly higher guardrails.

“It is time to build a modern bridge that will serve the communities of the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula for the next 100 years,” Youngkin said in an April 15 statement. “Today we are accelerating construction of a new Norris Bridge to meet the daily travel needs of residents and businesses, and to welcome visitors to these scenic waterfront regions.Through this action, people will be driving over the new bridge almost a decade sooner than expected.” 
Stephen C. Brich, commissioner of highways for VDOT, said last week that staff has identified a collection of special structure projects for potential advancement, but did not specifically name any.
However, the Mercury was able to identify some of the upcoming special structure projects, according to a recent resolution passed by the board, including: the Big Walker Mountain Tunnel in the Bristol District; a SMART Road in Salem; the Benjamin Harrison Bridge in Richmond; the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel; and the Rosslyn Tunnel in Northern Virginia.
“This isn’t just about the Norris bridge,” Miller said. “This is just the beginning. It impacts everything in the schedule because now we’ve got money in front. So it’s really a great win for the commonwealth.”

RICHMOND, Va. – Vickie Connors, assistant professor at the Center of Environmental Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, owns a small farm a little over 40 miles from campus.
Two farmers maintain the 20-acre property, and like many in Virginia, they rely on long-range forecasts to decide what crops to grow.
Many Virginia farmers use the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, to guide their agricultural operations. However, cuts to the federal workforce under President Donald Trump have begun to affect NOAA’s employees, and there is concern that its ability to provide weather forecasts will be impacted.
Agriculture is the biggest private industry in Virginia, with an economic impact of $82.3 billion and over 381,800 jobs in 2021, according to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and a study by the University of Virginia.
 NOAA’s impact on agriculture

NOAA is a science agency that focuses on weather forecasting, monitoring the oceanic and atmospheric conditions, studying climate change and sharing its information.
“NOAA has responsibility in the area of our atmosphere and our oceans to keep up with what’s happening in those environments and also to provide warnings if something serious might happen,” Connors said.
The agency provides weather and climate information to farmers so they can make decisions on their crops and livestock. This includes drought and nitrogen management, according to NOAA.
The forecasted intensity of rainfall makes a big difference for farming communities when they plan resource management, according to Connors. This includes livestock operations if farmers are growing grain to feed their animals through the winter.
“It’s really hard to think about anyone who doesn’t take advantage at some level the work and the data that NOAA provides,” Connors said.
NOAA also alerts when inclement weather is approaching, according to the National Weather Service.
 Federal cuts begin to disrupt NOAA’s workforce

Approximately 650 employees from NOAA were fired on Feb. 27, according to Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator, who spoke at a press conference the next day. The mass layoffs are part of a broader workforce reduction under the Department of Government Efficiency, a new agency created by the Trump administration to tackle government bloat.
The number of layoffs may have increased since, according to multiple reports, although it is difficult to track the exact number. NOAA is seated within the Department of Commerce and in September 2024 had a reported 12,430 total employees, according to a congressional report.
 Confusion and concern among weather experts

There’s a large amount of uncertainty with the layoffs, according to Sean Sublette, a Virginia meteorologist whose forecasts have been found on air, in print and online.
“It’s hard to know precisely who has been laid off because some people are laid off and then they’ve been called back and then laid off again,” Sublette said.
His friend in Washington was laid off, rehired and then let go again. Another friend in Maryland was laid off from NOAA, but was recently called back to return. The unpredictability of these layoffs leaves employees unsure of what they are supposed to do, according to Sublette.
“These are all government workers, these are people whose career in public service protecting life and property, which is what NOAA’s mission has always been,” Sublette said.
 Balloon launches cut, budget slashed further

Sublette’s main concern is for the three primary National Weather Service offices in Virginia, where radars monitor for damaging weather, tornadoes and thunderstorms. People in the Blacksburg, Dulles and Wakefield offices are worried about staff being laid off.
“If the weather’s especially volatile, and you need to bring in extra staff to handle it,” Sublette said. “Are they not available anymore?”
Sublette also expressed concern about potential cuts to the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service, a primary receiving station for satellite information.
“Those classical satellite pictures that you get on your phone or you see on TV,” Sublette explained. “So if people, they’re laid off, does that put that equipment and that information at risk?”
NOAA’s data collection capabilities have already been hit. The NWS announced on March 20 that it would reduce the number of daily weather balloon launches at six forecast offices across the country. These balloons, typically launched twice a day, collect data about air pressure, wind speed and direction, humidity, and temperature.
Under the new plan, balloons will now be launched once a day from those sites, according to the NWS.
More funding concerns were recently raised, with multiple outlets reporting that the Office of Management and Budget proposed an upcoming 27% cut to NOAA’s current $6 billion budget.

 Virginia farmers rely on forecasts to plan season

Virginia’s agricultural sector could be significantly impacted by continued layoffs and reduced weather data. This follows a difficult year for Virginia farmers.
Hurricane Helene caused almost $160 million in damages to farms in Virginia due to flooding and harsh winds, according to an agricultural damage assessment by the Virginia Cooperative Extension. That includes crop and livestock loss, in addition to land and infrastructure damage.
Many regions also experienced drought. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a drought watch advisory to 95 counties and cities and a drought warning advisory to 12 counties in Virginia last June.
Farmers’ ability to respond to such conditions is closely tied to access to weather data services, according to Andrea Young, farmer and owner of Hidden Creek Farm in Fauquier County.
It’s more difficult for farmers to prepare and react to weather without data.
“I cannot bring the animals to safety, I cannot cover up those tender plants, I cannot know that a rainstorm is coming and so I shouldn’t water,” Young said. “I cannot function as a farmer in an outdoor environment.”
 Some farmers trust instincts, not instruments

Not all farmers see the cuts as damaging. Howard Smith Sr., dairy farmer and owner of Gospel Spreading Farm in James City County, spends a lot of time outside. He relies more on traditional knowledge and weather patterns than digital forecasts.
“You don’t cut hay when you know the storm is coming,” Smith said, as an example.
 He doesn’t believe NOAA cuts will greatly impact farmers in the area, who, like him, may know from lots of outdoor experience what the weather will blow in or out.
“If you look in the clouds and you see a mist being drawn up into the clouds, then just know from experience that within three days it shall return upon the earth— it’s going to rain,” Smith said. “You can’t match that with no type of instrument.”
  Climate change and food security

The future carries much uncertainty for farmers, with climate change shifting agricultural growing zones and seasons. They have to prepare for major shifts in precipitation patterns, soil moisture, heat and minimum nighttime temperatures, while already living “right on the margin” of making a living, Connors said.
NOAA provides a global perspective of information that is utilized and tailored for agricultural purposes.
“Without that data stream, they will essentially be thrust back into like the 1700s of what they can do,” Connors said.
The cuts to NOAA will also impact consumers, according to Connors. Farmers won’t be as able to make informed decisions, and it could lead to food insecurity for the whole country.
“If we defund the federal agencies like NOAA and NASA, we’re essentially turning our back on science,” Connors said.

At first blush, the idea that eviction is the solution for landlords when residential tenants fall behind on their rent or otherwise violate terms of a lease seems obvious.
And, indeed, in many situations, it is the only realistic path.
As new research from landlord-tenant law experts at the national Legal Services Corporation shows however, there are actually relatively few situations in which evictions end up being a win for landlords.
The study found that eviction proceedings seldom result in landlords recovering back rent and often end up costing thousands of dollars.
So, what should landlords do?
The researchers found that by working together — rather than merely as adversaries — landlords and legal aid providers can reduce financial losses, improve stability for all parties, and minimize costs and disruptions.
The bottom line: At a time in which so many renters are cost-burdened, there is no magic solution. But data show that, often, landlords can achieve better results for everyone by thinking outside of the box.

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
USDA cuts hit small farms as Trump showers billions on big farms

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.

In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury. 


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing already has made a comeback

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.











We're only one wildfire away from bankruptcy. Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.


– Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association



The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and Montana lawmakers have sent a proposal to the governor. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, while a North Dakota bill passed the Senate but was narrowly defeated in the House. An Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
California fires show states’ ‘last resort’ insurance plans could be overwhelmed

But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.
